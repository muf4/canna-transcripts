[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Hash Church, episode 14 from
Hash Church 2.0.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome all Hash Church attendees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last I checked, there was damn near 100 of
you guys in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 134 people in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't we get started and send off
these links to all of the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna send off an email first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, better go Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send that off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we will send off the message over
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom, boom, bam, boom.
Oops.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always the challenge getting everyone
the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting everyone the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez, I'm looking forward to today's
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very stoked always to have Hilary
Black and Forrest Herd from the Beladrius
[SPEAKER_06]: Network.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm super excited to have Valerie stop in
and share with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't spoken with her in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have invited in Skunkman Sam as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if he's able to make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, let's just see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I would expect probably Etienne
coming in before anyone else.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's usually the winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been some time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: You even beat Etienne into the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm telling you, that does not happen
very often.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've been waiting for this connect.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life's a lot of ways, I bet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, life's busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've come a far way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually watching the nature of
things video that Hillary sent me the
[SPEAKER_06]: other day when she went down and visited
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That must be like 20 plus years ago now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess I met you guys a few
years later at Skunkman Sam's place in
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I knew that we had met, but I
couldn't place it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that it might have been up north
at the turn.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll get in here.
[SPEAKER_12]: My computer's been misbehaving,
but all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we can hear you perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just can't see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to see me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people choose not to be seen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just got my makeup done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm looking forward to today's
discussion with everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's, you know, Etienne is
often with us being a pioneer down in
[SPEAKER_06]: California, but it's nice to have
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be great to have Hillary
come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know she's in Ottawa right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's absolutely nonstop and she's got
some some interesting things to share with
[SPEAKER_06]: us this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also invited Kirk Toussaint,
a really well-spoken lawyer who now works
[SPEAKER_06]: for Canopy Growth as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I saw him recently speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it was a cannabis conversation
that he spoke at on the news with Bill
[SPEAKER_06]: Blair and a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was just so well-spoken that I
wanted to get him in as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, sister?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I had to not beat Etienne.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_12]: There.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome back, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got we're waiting on Forest is
going to be coming in in a few minutes as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I sent out the invitation to the
Dragonfly Earth Medicine as well as Wade
[SPEAKER_06]: Laughter, always people that seem to
really facilitate a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, people that are into this
also up to their necks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I mean by this is just the whole,
you know, the the the activism,
[SPEAKER_06]: the growing, the educating the sort of all
these things that I guess the activism has
[SPEAKER_06]: turned into as we get more and more
permissions and more and more capabilities
[SPEAKER_06]: to do these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Permissions?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we we created our own permissions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's an industry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: These two women before us are the the
pioneers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yes, you could consider me a
pioneer, but we're the second generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Valerie was first generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hillary was a predecessor there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I consider myself a secondary pioneer
to these these amazing ladies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, darling.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to remember the last one.
[SPEAKER_14]: The last one that I saw you in person.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if I've seen you since we
filmed The Nature of Things in 1998.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, have I seen you in person since
then?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we saw one another at a hemp
thing up in the hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it has been it's probably been 20
years, you know, a long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's try to find some event that we both
want to go to and see if we can cross
[SPEAKER_14]: paths, because I sure would love you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, lady.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be lovely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been more fewer cannabis events and
more, you know, more bedside events.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's more where I've been.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Kaladrius.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just see you bumped in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, it's so lovely to see you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: You haven't changed at all, except the way
is that we the way that we grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you ignited a flame.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you, Valerie, because Hillary
has not stopped since she came back from
[SPEAKER_06]: California in 1998.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been like watching a comet across
the sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been very, very inspirational,
to say the least.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's pulled a lot of good out of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that being just a helper and an
assistant and someone who could help
[SPEAKER_06]: facilitate things for her.
[SPEAKER_06]: She always made me just feel like I just I
felt great helping the club.
[SPEAKER_06]: I helped great being a part of anything
that she was a part of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel blessed to have been,
you know, the small part that I got to be
[SPEAKER_06]: in it and still be in it and watching her
do all these amazing things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that you were a big part of
that, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was fun hanging out on the beach and on
the mountain and playing, playing,
[SPEAKER_14]: being people.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's wild rewatching that what a like baby
I was really.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like we I was literally like 10 months
into the Compassion Club like we were the
[SPEAKER_14]: we were selling cannabis on a little tiny
digital scale in like a empty tea box was
[SPEAKER_14]: like the thing with cannabis out in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, things really exploded after I
got to come and spend some time with you
[SPEAKER_14]: and you, Mark Richardson.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you are like have been a part of
the work, but also you catch me like you
[SPEAKER_14]: say that I'm a comet.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I can't I can't get so emotional that
I'm teary in the first five minutes of
[SPEAKER_14]: Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_14]: But when not being a comet and I burn out,
you are one of the people that catches me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy, happy to be here for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was reading when I when I made
the Hash Church, I guess the pre paragraph
[SPEAKER_06]: to explain who was going to be coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did just a couple of Google searches on
both of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the interesting thing that I found
immediately in Valerie's story and in your
[SPEAKER_06]: stories and it was it seemed like it was
in the first couple of paragraphs of both
[SPEAKER_06]: stories that I brought up were that you
both in all of this have had guns put to
[SPEAKER_06]: your head by enforcement officers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought, oh my God, what a terrible
thing to have in common yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just this really real thing that
we're a part of that it can't be escaped,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and that was that was pretty
pretty incredible for me to read that you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys have that in common.
[SPEAKER_14]: Has that happened to you more than once
now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it has.
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, but and you know, the the
interesting thing that I think is that how
[SPEAKER_12]: all of us know a place within that state,
I'm not saying that I feel safe with a gun
[SPEAKER_12]: to my head.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that's not so, but that there's a
place inside that knows and they perhaps
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe it is the the experiences well,
certainly the experiences of our life lend
[SPEAKER_12]: to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the more the psychedelic or expanded
experiences that reveal to us that there
[SPEAKER_12]: is a deep awareness and connection to self
and that we can and and do find our way
[SPEAKER_12]: into that place.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the place that protects us when
internally when the external becomes too
[SPEAKER_12]: too much to bear and people all over the
world know that experience ours in in lieu
[SPEAKER_12]: of what is occurring throughout the planet
at this time of polarization within our
[SPEAKER_12]: own country and from state to state
national state from country to country and
[SPEAKER_12]: internally is profoundly important.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think for me to have that experience so
that I I can both share develop more
[SPEAKER_12]: compassion and share that internal
experience and knowledge of that to know
[SPEAKER_12]: that deep fear deep can breed deep
resentment and anger and it can also breed
[SPEAKER_12]: compassion so that you know, perhaps those
are the little ways the human ways in a
[SPEAKER_12]: world of almost 8 billion people that we
share knowledge of one another that we
[SPEAKER_12]: become better people, you know,
then we then this moment, you know from
[SPEAKER_12]: moment to moment is getting a whole
lifetime to become a master.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess, you know, we're just here
trying to figure out how to be the master
[SPEAKER_12]: of self and then all the rest falls away
and is forgotten really.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's you know, it's just a blip
but really an amazingly fun and remarkable
[SPEAKER_12]: blip.
[SPEAKER_12]: So from in that personal experience of
life.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the yeah, I've had guns pointed at me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know, I know that what's done
I won't belabor this but I know that
[SPEAKER_12]: what's done is to men is by men DEA agents
or agents dudes with guns is can be
[SPEAKER_12]: demeaning and and in our country that men
with guns can't touch women the way that
[SPEAKER_12]: they touch men the way that they harm and
cause try to break a man emotionally.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not saying it's less for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm saying it's different and you know,
I don't know that that's the case all the
[SPEAKER_12]: time, but I also know that they don't know
agents don't know what they're walking
[SPEAKER_12]: into.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't know if they're walking into a
gun.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't know if they're walking into
they're facing their death.
[SPEAKER_12]: So no excuses just that we're trying all
of us to learn how to be in this world
[SPEAKER_12]: together.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean cannabis is a huge but you know,
this is the big industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, you've got the
pharmaceutical industry and tobacco and
[SPEAKER_12]: alcohol and all the big dudes and I say
dudes because I know there are a few women
[SPEAKER_12]: in there too, but you know, put pulling
down ownership and pushing out small
[SPEAKER_12]: business and pushing aside compassion.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean for us, we know that we've seen
what's happened to the we're not Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not connects.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't do we don't do compassion.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do pull yourself up by your bootstraps
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know there's there's too little
compassion on the planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess it's remains our job,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So and how do you put the?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you put the the gun of kindness the
one that that blows open someone's heart,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, how do you put that to their
heart if they haven't been a party to
[SPEAKER_12]: suffering or became hardened through their
own suffering instead of more
[SPEAKER_12]: compassionate?
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yes, I had a gun at least like a few
few guns pulled on me only by cops,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is fortunate.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess looking back on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirk, we've got a voice coming through
Valerie's mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to mute you when you're not
talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very interesting and very well put,
Valerie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just mentioning this guy's name,
I could have a hundred people hate me
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's classified as he gets put
into all these different classifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I saw Jordan Peterson talking on Joe
Rogan the other day, and he was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about the importance of of difficulty and
how it unlocks things in our DNA.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we as not necessarily suffer,
but as we do things that are difficult,
[SPEAKER_06]: as we do things that are challenging,
that it actually unlocks DNA in our own
[SPEAKER_06]: self and opens ourself up more to who we
have the potential of being.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just really explained that in the
most beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how do we unlock?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we blow up compassion in someone's
heart?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it's by maybe not reacting the
way they anticipate and expect one to
[SPEAKER_06]: react in these particular situations when
putting a gun to someone's head is a very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very serious thing and doing it over
flowers and doing it to someone who's
[SPEAKER_06]: actually helping terminally ill and
palliative care people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems to take it to a level where
you would think that the natural thing to
[SPEAKER_06]: do would be resentful and angry and to not
have that experience and to shift it to
[SPEAKER_06]: the other direction is very, very
powerful, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Wave.
[SPEAKER_14]: It only happened to me once.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mark, it was when our friend Kyle was
getting busted and he was growing for the
[SPEAKER_14]: Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I went to his house on purpose and I
was the one who opened the door to the
[SPEAKER_14]: police on purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ran into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I ran right into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the young man who had the gun,
who was like, get down on the floor as
[SPEAKER_14]: soon as I opened the door.
[SPEAKER_14]: And had the gun on me very much towards my
head.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was terrified.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was trembling.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember seeing the like shaking gun
thinking, oh, this is not good.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I was like, you're okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not armed.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that was my response was realizing
that like he I think was more terrified
[SPEAKER_14]: than I was.
[SPEAKER_14]: I felt pretty strong and calm and clear.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that poor peach fuzz armed guy was
like, yeah, he was not having a good day
[SPEAKER_14]: having to pull that gun out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole experience was really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there obviously from the start.
[SPEAKER_06]: I dropped him off at his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had forgotten his keys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I suggested it wasn't a good idea at this
time of night to try and break into his
[SPEAKER_06]: house because a neighbor was going to
think that he was breaking into the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just call a locksmith.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we called a locksmith and the locksmith
worked on the front door for half an hour
[SPEAKER_06]: while the neighbor saw the locksmith.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought we were breaking into the house
called the police.
[SPEAKER_06]: The police showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to see ID.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to see this, that the other
thing they eventually wanted to gain
[SPEAKER_06]: access to the house because right up at
the house, it didn't stink.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the sidewalk to the house,
it reeked just the way it is sometimes
[SPEAKER_06]: with smells where you, you make toast in
your house and it doesn't smell in your
[SPEAKER_06]: kitchen, but you walk halfway up your
staircase and there's that toast smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happened with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of pretended to leave our house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so hyper aware at times, especially
when it comes to the police.
[SPEAKER_06]: I realized they haven't left at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've actually gone and parked down the
block in the back lane and they are
[SPEAKER_06]: awaiting a warrant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm talking to my friend, like,
listen, let's, let's figure this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we could throw everything into the
neighbor's backyard for the time being.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to help my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he's also not from Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to see him get sent back down
to the U S and what, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking call Hillary black is what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Hillary literally races down to the
house, goes inside, you know, calms him
[SPEAKER_14]: down, trying to burn the clones fresh.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was poor guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He created exurgent, exigent, exigent
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the term Kirk?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some sort of circumstance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Circumstances.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exigent circumstances.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just means emergency lawyer word for
emergency or rooting them, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: I say he should have juiced them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was quite, quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that started a whole ball rolling for
you Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was one of those moments where
you just, uh, you're just like,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course I'm going to go run down there
and be at the front door when they open
[SPEAKER_06]: the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's, I'll tell you, that's,
that's a compassion club owner right
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, no joke about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was growing for us and I wanted it on
the record.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Still.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hillary.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_14]: I only had the opportunity to do it once,
knock on wood.
Thankfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the bottom line is you would have done
it a hundred more times had you had the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is also about my privilege and that I
know that like I am a privileged white
[SPEAKER_14]: girl and I grew up in a neighborhood where
I always felt like the police work for me
[SPEAKER_14]: and that I'm protected.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so like I knew in that moment,
also the courage to run in there and open
[SPEAKER_14]: that door was a part of me exercising
privilege.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the consistent vigilance to take
care of your caregivers and those that
[SPEAKER_07]: provide for you, because life is
unpredictable all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a constant prepare and getting them
counsel and everything that you can to get
[SPEAKER_07]: them back on track.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's, it's yeah, it's part of
that eternal vigilance reality that we
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's good to have both Wade and
Forrest in the house as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a, I guess, Wade or Forrest,
you guys have been doing the good fight as
[SPEAKER_06]: well, but not necessarily that 20 year ago
fight where they're putting guns to your
[SPEAKER_06]: head, but at the same time, it must feel a
lot like having a gun put to your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely, I've told about this
several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for the path that was paved
so that we could kind of enjoy the
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness that we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but yeah, there, you know,
there's different ways to put guns to
[SPEAKER_01]: people's heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I know something that we're
all struggling with right now is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is not necessarily the immediate law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law enforcement risk is, is coming
kind of rapidly on us here as electives
[SPEAKER_01]: are, are ended in a few weeks here in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, you know, the, I've been
obviously not able to attend as much
[SPEAKER_01]: because a hundred percent of the focus has
just been on preparing for and helping
[SPEAKER_01]: families emotionally prepare for a lot of
these programs and ours, especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that, you know, I obviously working
with directly ending here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have these kids with
terminal illness and no plan and laws that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to end the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're helping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked to a lot of parents in panic
mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it froze up on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: He froze.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Panic mode is, I can't even really
imagine, you know, this is a forest comes
[SPEAKER_06]: from a unique place.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all compassionate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all want to help people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, I know Valerie's journey started
with her accidents and her head injury.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just how, how can it get any more
personal?
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's, when it's your family member,
when it's your child, it just seems so,
[SPEAKER_06]: so wrong on so many different levels that
they just have to make that right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, people are obviously, you know,
getting people out of their records and
[SPEAKER_06]: out of jail time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's hugely important.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think first and foremost is,
you know, the palliative people,
[SPEAKER_06]: the terminal people, the children with
this extremely low quality of life due to
[SPEAKER_06]: the suffering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of their ailments and diseases
that just kind of just needs to be put
[SPEAKER_06]: right at the top of the shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people with palliative care
increasing and increasing the quality of
[SPEAKER_06]: life for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're back, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got two forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what happened there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figures, figures have finally say
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then living in the mountains is such a
joy, you know, now we can see the forest
[SPEAKER_07]: from the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's when it cut out, but,
uh, you were just at panic mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes I was saying is,
you know, we're not sure if, if those days
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming again, you know, I've had my
son's gardens rated just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happened to not be on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I didn't have guns at my
head, but here we are now again,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at breaking the law or not
treating our kids and the patients that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I feel like we're, we've made
all this progress and obviously we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, but at the same time, uh, we're
looking at being in the very real position
[SPEAKER_01]: again of having no other option,
but to be outside the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that comes along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, there's a lot of work to be done
still nonstop civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say too, this is, this is the
interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, how legalization in America has
created less access for those who,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, those who really need it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I, you know, what is one suffering over
the other?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, but let's just, let's just presume
that the people who are the sickest and
[SPEAKER_12]: the poorest and the have the least access.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, have a greater need because they
cannot access cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the polarization between that
need and the service that's provided and
[SPEAKER_12]: the new front of service, the month,
sanctified, uh, Jeffrey guys, uh,
[SPEAKER_12]: a GW pharmaceutical cannabis, um,
and how that, uh, creates lack of service
[SPEAKER_12]: until they move in to sell it to all of
America itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: Et cetera, et cetera, the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so by denying, I think, and you know,
my conspiratorial, well, I mean,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, as Bob Wilson used to say,
consider yourself on a group of your
[SPEAKER_12]: closest friends, the conspiracy,
uh, conspirators.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope so because, um, we,
it's our turn to conspire against,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, and has been for generations to
conspire against the, uh, the critical
[SPEAKER_12]: force of the, of the, um, corporate state
and that structure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not to allow, you know, it's,
it's very Jeff Bezos, his name means
[SPEAKER_12]: kisses, but that's kind of the kiss of
death.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the, the way that you crush your
competition so that you are the sole
[SPEAKER_12]: server, that you are the sole proprietor.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you own everything, you control it.
[SPEAKER_12]: What, what I see is as so phenomenally,
uh, difficult and painful as the creation
[SPEAKER_12]: of the suffering that has happened in
this, in America or in California and in
[SPEAKER_12]: the States where cannabis is legal,
where we are not allowed to serve.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that will become more and more,
I mean, there are many different ways that
[SPEAKER_12]: that's being achieved or we're being
denied, but that is becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_12]: prevalent and more obvious.
[SPEAKER_12]: So unless you have a great deal of money,
um, you can put, create your, get,
[SPEAKER_12]: gain your licenses, pay the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_12]: dollars or more to remodel, create this
guarded, uh, um, uh, entry or access to
[SPEAKER_12]: your, your, uh, business and, and then,
um, put in place all of those pieces to
[SPEAKER_12]: serve people a plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me just say that again, a plant,
um, you know, then you, one is not able to
[SPEAKER_12]: continue to do that, provide that service.
[SPEAKER_12]: So who are our competitors, our true
competitors?
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem in my opinion is that we think
it's, it's each other and it's not.
[SPEAKER_12]: If there were, you know, a national and
international, um, uh, group of,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, uh, a group, you know, a, um,
um, our own sort of, um, union or CFL,
[SPEAKER_12]: CIO or something is a cannabis union where
we worked together in the, really the
[SPEAKER_12]: greater sense of, of promoting the small
business and at, with service at our core,
[SPEAKER_12]: at our center, we wouldn't be in the
position.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really a tidal wave of,
of ownership and, and, uh, corporate
[SPEAKER_12]: entrepreneurship and, um, some people will
make money.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's, that will happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's certain.
[SPEAKER_12]: But however, more people will be pushed
aside and be work, you know, go back to
[SPEAKER_12]: the coal mine kind of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's probably dramatic, but I mean to be
dramatic right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think that that's a, a very huge
issue and you know, California has had 25,
[SPEAKER_12]: 26 years to do good and we didn't,
we made a mess of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We could have created such a remarkable,
um, uh, force with, uh, self governance
[SPEAKER_12]: and, and the, the highest standards.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and you know, we mucked it up through
competitiveness, being competitive with
[SPEAKER_12]: one another and, you know, trying to be
the fastest draw and have the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really an aside because the
best is just such a temporal place to sit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, everyone's forgotten at,
you know, it's kind of like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like in a thousand years, who cares?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what can we do now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Who do we serve now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Who do you serve?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, um, I really, this is,
and look at, to look at Forrest and
[SPEAKER_12]: Kaladrius and the, and the, to think of
that, the impact, you know, now,
[SPEAKER_12]: now we have to step forward, make sure
that Forrest can be the liaison that he is
[SPEAKER_12]: to service, to care, to saving lives and
be there for, for him, lest it be me,
[SPEAKER_12]: lest it be you.
[SPEAKER_12]: How soon?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause you know, it is, America is a bad
dog, but it isn't only America that's the
[SPEAKER_12]: bad dog.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's, it's, it's the corporate
state, which knows no boundaries and has
[SPEAKER_12]: no vote and never dies and never goes to
jail.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, that's so bad dog anyway.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, um, you know, it's too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kurt left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I saw him recently on a, I guess it
was just kind of like, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_06]: it was called.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was on, there with Bill Blair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a cannabis conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill Blair being our, you know,
the main guy that was put in charge of,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, cannabis legalization or cannabis,
you know, the, you know, how things were
[SPEAKER_06]: going to roll out in Canada for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this, you know, this gentleman that
spent his entire life enforcing cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: laws and, you know, has probably never in
his life used cannabis is now in charge
[SPEAKER_06]: of, you know, the regulations to,
to put in place to control everyone in
[SPEAKER_06]: regards to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Kurt was just so like
perfect in every, um, I'll put the link up
[SPEAKER_06]: in the comments of this hash church when
it's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys can watch it because he just,
you know, it's scary to see the delusions
[SPEAKER_06]: of people in regards to cannabis and the
way the news stories go out of their way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let's find this girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: She says she's addicted to cannabis and
we'll make, we'll make cannabis look
[SPEAKER_06]: really scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll bring this guy on and he
can talk about impaired cannabis drivers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's really scary too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, oh, then we'll talk about edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause how frightening is it that children
could access edibles and each and every
[SPEAKER_06]: time Kirk just so beautifully and so
articulated just destroyed any semblance
[SPEAKER_06]: of sanity in their discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just came across looking not really
all together about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, uh, it's one of the reasons I
invited Kurt in today, but he has many
[SPEAKER_06]: children.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, I know he's very busy.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said he's going to be back in 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's taking one of his kids to school.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_14]: School event of some kind, but in that
conversation, I mean, I have had the
[SPEAKER_14]: privilege and honor of presenting with
Kirk, you know, the Senate and here and
[SPEAKER_14]: there, and I never liked going before him
because he's always like, I'm always like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you please like take it home.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's so approachable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, in that one particular
conversation, with Bill Blair,
[SPEAKER_14]: so he has four kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: I tease him sometimes if he has like 16
children, but it's actually only four,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in that conversation with Bill,
the thing that he very diplomatically
[SPEAKER_14]: pragmatically took him to task on is one
of the many things in our legalization
[SPEAKER_14]: regulations that have to be fixed is that
it's still a criminal offense for anybody
[SPEAKER_14]: to traffic to a minor.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that means that it's a criminal offense
for a parent to give somebody under the
[SPEAKER_14]: age of 18 cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the consequences are quite high.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I can't remember exactly what the
fines and the how many years in jail are.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kirk can tell us when he comes back,
but Kirk really talks about in such a
[SPEAKER_14]: relatable way about a parent's right to
model responsible use.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that if a parent wants to,
um, share a glass of wine with their
[SPEAKER_14]: teenager at home and show them how to,
you know, use can't use wine in a safe
[SPEAKER_14]: way, that that's absolutely, you know,
their right to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's encouraging parents to do it,
that that's actually the best way for us
[SPEAKER_14]: to show our youth how to use cannabis
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my favorite part of his
conversation with Bill Blair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 14 years trafficking cannabis to
someone under 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a maximum fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's scary and it sounds insane,
but keep in mind when I was arrested with
[SPEAKER_06]: the compassion club in 1998, I,
I was facing 25 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the, that's what the fine on
the books in Canada was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was anything over three kilos,
uh, was a maximum fine of 25 years in
[SPEAKER_06]: prison, which is, uh, pretty insane when
you think about that, that's on our books.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I doubt anyone's ever been given it,
but at that point, why not just get it off
[SPEAKER_06]: the books?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the thing about the youth,
the way that we've seen it, we've set it
[SPEAKER_14]: up with youth because our legalization is
kind of like, it's like, we're,
[SPEAKER_14]: we're leading, we've legalized cannabis
with a prohibitionist mentality,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the way that we had to feed
legalization to the prohibitionist in
[SPEAKER_14]: power was this is how we're going to
reduce the harms of cannabis rather than
[SPEAKER_14]: we're really sorry that we lied to you for
a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is actually based in like racism
and capitalism.
[SPEAKER_14]: But so the whole protect the youth piece,
if you're a 19 year old and you pass a
[SPEAKER_14]: joint to an 18 year old, that whole body
of criminal law applies to you in terms of
[SPEAKER_14]: that offense.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the scary thing about those kinds of
regulations is that we can say,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, like they're probably,
and again, let's, let's jump back to this
[SPEAKER_14]: when Kirk is back, this is kind of like so
much his wheelhouse, but they,
[SPEAKER_14]: we can assume based on how prohibition has
been applied, that those laws will be
[SPEAKER_14]: exercised in a disproportionate way.
[SPEAKER_14]: The, if you are poor or if you are,
do not have white skin, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_14]: more likely to receive those kinds of
charges than if you have money,
[SPEAKER_14]: our white and our Sharon joint with your
kid in your nice house.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this is, this is where we
overlap.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're not exactly the same laws.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can serve children primarily.
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I believe here because so many of our
initial patients and the people that we
[SPEAKER_12]: served were youth underage and parents
were stepping in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of them lost their children.
[SPEAKER_12]: CPS took them.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been a fear.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know of a forest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how can you be in the position?
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing more important for a
parent than to protect his or her child.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just profound importance.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you, and again, does what you have to
do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to, I'd rather not speak for you,
but I wanted to dovetail on something that
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we both face and know that we have
to deal with here.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where we, this is again,
where you become, it becomes a grassroots
[SPEAKER_12]: work and you go back into the trenches of
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I was just going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, uh, you know, last year I did
a panel at the Emerald cup about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is like, I'm like, no people,
you know, there's not a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: can really advocate for the children on
the other side that, that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately discredited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they are absolutely valid voices,
but, but they're the prohibitionist side
[SPEAKER_01]: is always saying, well, they have an
agenda, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this business, they have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they discount them.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the privileges of my situation is
I've always been in this position of just
[SPEAKER_01]: being a parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't own any other business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the charity that we have doesn't make
any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, uh, financial gain there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was always able to be used in that
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Hillary is absolutely
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always see this, um, this under,
under appreciation for the risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical medication, they exaggerate
how well those things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they exaggerate the harms of
cannabis, you know, so they're constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about emergency room visits and
the uptick and emergency room visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the edibles are allowed, but they
never really go past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ever say once they're in the
emergency room, they just kind of give
[SPEAKER_01]: them some fluids and tell them to hang out
for a little bit and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's no demonstrated harm
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they talk about pharmaceutical
medication and risk and children,
[SPEAKER_01]: they never talk about absolutely how
dangerous the pharmaceutical meds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being given the kids are, especially in
comparison with a cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't talk about what it's like to
give a phenobarbital to a 11 month old
[SPEAKER_01]: child.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't talk about the intestinal
damage that is caused by that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the addiction rates in children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they don't talk about any of the
things that, that happen every day with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with these medications that are not
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also not beneficial for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, I think again, where I've
always been is it's just education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, when you have kind of compile
some of the statistics and numbers per
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're going to treat, um,
suffering in adults and children versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, the efficacy rates of
medicine versus their side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't ethically ever say that
cannabis should never, um, not be the
[SPEAKER_01]: first option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if the thought behind medicine is,
is first do no harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's the, the model our
doctors are going to take, then the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest chance of efficacy with least
chance of negative side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, literally none in most cases,
um, it's going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid therapies of some type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is everything on the news is,
you know, every cannabis, uh, sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: story that's done is always like with a
wink, wink, nod, nod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's four 20 and everyone's coming out
to a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's, um, to this day,
you know, despite my efforts and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: others, uh, cannabis is still reported as,
as kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it's just a party tool when
it's so much more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lack of reporting on how serious
of a topic, some of the aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis are, are the reason we can be
banning, uh, you know, medical access for
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of thousands of patients here in
California, one of the largest economies
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world here in just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a news story.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not, uh, an uproar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's nothing while people like,
I'm sure Valerie and myself, I get 10 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 phone calls a day from families crying,
panicking children that we've pulled out
[SPEAKER_01]: of hospice because nothing was working,
uh, wondering what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as these, uh, charities are shut down
and it's, it's not even an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four 20s here, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and let's high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it really is a shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's a thought on that forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about when our own community is more
obsessed with getting awards, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: for their own works and spend countless
amounts of money on these events for
[SPEAKER_06]: booths and for tickets and to win a prize
and to be, to be basically like patting
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves on the back and then putting
that in all of their Instagrams and their
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook posts and telling everyone how
much they won when there's groups like
[SPEAKER_06]: yours that are the frontline of this,
because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll put the gun to a lot of people's
heads, but I've yet to see them do it to
[SPEAKER_06]: the children.
[SPEAKER_06]: The children I said a few years back,
it's like the last leg that prohibition
[SPEAKER_06]: has to stand on.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've kind of gone around you,
but you guys can never forget that you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys have a power that no one else in the
community has.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's why I've always been sort
of attracted to what you're doing and to
[SPEAKER_06]: what Hillary was doing and Valerie and
Etienne and just always kind of wanting to
[SPEAKER_06]: support that in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you just the other day for us that
what you guys do is my favorite part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the soul of the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think that when, when there's a
big event like the Emerald Cup coming up,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think every single one of those
companies and more should be donating to
[SPEAKER_06]: groups like yours.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what's happened with legalization is
it's created an illusion of service.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the same problem there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can get what you need or you can get
what you want.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in fact, that is not true.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people can get what they need and
some people can get what they want.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there has been a dismissiveness from
many of the dispensaries of medical.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we don't really deal with medical
anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, medical is another type of service.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they don't say that's not good for
business to say, don't go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the, but that illusion of service has
created that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, one of the ways that to get
parents who've never tried cannabis or who
[SPEAKER_12]: are concerned or even if they have tried
cannabis or concerned about getting their
[SPEAKER_12]: kids down is to ask them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I probably forest has done this too is
just to say, look, take one half of one
[SPEAKER_12]: dose of the medication that you give your
child every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just one half of one dose.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then tell me how you feel.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, then it, it changes the
perspective, but that still doesn't answer
[SPEAKER_12]: the question and the, the, the
difficulties that we face today in serving
[SPEAKER_12]: those in the greatest need 200,
nearly 250,000 Californians became
[SPEAKER_12]: medically bankrupt, three people per
household.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's on, you know, three quarters of a
million people.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you look at that, those numbers and
you see the impact of our completely out
[SPEAKER_12]: of balance system in America, where the,
the, the most importance lay in the power
[SPEAKER_12]: that the biggest corporations have.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, every, every country in the
quote unquote free, free ish world faces
[SPEAKER_12]: those kinds of impacts and that type of
oversight of, of business.
[SPEAKER_12]: It, it does not allow for the,
the way that lives profit or benefit from,
[SPEAKER_12]: from access.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, I always, you know,
I feel like I've got the, the market
[SPEAKER_12]: cornered because I, I serve the poor,
you know, I don't, I'm not the only one
[SPEAKER_12]: who does it, but I don't have a lot of
competition to serve the poor.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what we're doing with our
business.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we've been closed for almost a
year, at least, you know, we're,
[SPEAKER_12]: I, we can help as an individual,
but you cannot help as a business unless
[SPEAKER_12]: you, you know, have, have met all these
hoops and we have not had a site for
[SPEAKER_12]: almost a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: I signed the lease a few days ago on a new
site, but we're taking what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The dispensary is only a small part of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest is a community center in which
we're drawing people with knowledge,
[SPEAKER_12]: with information.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an MD and ND, are you Vedic,
a doctor, an herbalist, people coming in
[SPEAKER_12]: who will be coming in and taking,
having a part-time residence there so that
[SPEAKER_12]: they can expand their mission to serve.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we know that one thing does not
heal, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's many things that heal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's our, our opportunity to provide
as much access to the different
[SPEAKER_12]: combinations of phytotherapies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I've just away, I've moved away from
using the word medical cannabis to
[SPEAKER_12]: phytothera, therapeutic applications or
phytotherapies, because it is profoundly
[SPEAKER_12]: important that we look at the bigger
picture.
[SPEAKER_12]: If for at least Wham to survive,
we won't, if I can't compete with
[SPEAKER_12]: dispensaries because it's not selling
cannabis that keeps us in a marketplace.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the service that keeps us in a
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I look to, to the future being my
hope is that over time we turn Wham into a
[SPEAKER_12]: worker owned cooperative.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because why?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because people, when you have
ownership, you produce the greatest
[SPEAKER_12]: quality the best quality, the highest
integrity, it's your own business.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can do what, and a group of many,
like we used to be the group of many that
[SPEAKER_12]: we could stand up to the power.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now in business, one has to define
oneself in a different way to survive as a
[SPEAKER_12]: small business.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you just look, look every day at
Amazon and what's happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, and I, you know, bang, and bash
Amazon because I hate his business
[SPEAKER_12]: practices, just Jeff Bezos' business
practices.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're terrible.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in, in any case, to expand by bringing
in the greatest minds and the greatest
[SPEAKER_12]: people, the greatest comrades in service,
one has the opportunity to create a
[SPEAKER_12]: business that truly serves wellness and
all kinds.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're well, stay well.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're sick, get well.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're dying, die well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that you, we are at the bedside.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the gym and in, in the thought
processes of people as we attempt to heal
[SPEAKER_12]: ourselves and, you know, like kind of
dorky, but become masters, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, that's what everybody's trying to
achieve the same thing, whether we know it
[SPEAKER_12]: or not, whether you want to make a billion
dollars or you, you want to have a happy
[SPEAKER_12]: dinner with your family.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still a sense deep within that we
are trying to touch and achieve.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's important, I think as a small
business, as a business person to give it
[SPEAKER_12]: back to the people in a way that has the
greatest potential.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe we'll still be in business in a
hundred years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, and I look to Forrest for some
of that camaraderie because I see Forrest
[SPEAKER_12]: as, as in the same basket of, as myself
and many others too.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are many people who I can learn from
and have too much to bring.
[SPEAKER_12]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've been in a really unique
situation with just working with
[SPEAKER_01]: pediatrics and, you know, that's why I
think everything comes down to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, education and educating the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marcus, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, I've, I've gotten a lot of
flack over the years because I really had
[SPEAKER_01]: to feel like it was important to address
the cannabis community as much as it was
[SPEAKER_01]: to address the prohibitionist community,
because, you know, both were doing things
[SPEAKER_01]: that intentionally or unintentionally were
putting kids and patients at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to get into that too
much, but, but it has to do with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the exploitation of the word
medicine, how it's been loosely applied to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that has to do with cannabis and
kind of devalued some of the, to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where that, you know, medicine is looked
at, medicinal cannabis is looked at in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big joke, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wink, wink, nod, nod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got a backache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, trying to get them to
use terms appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can tend to a big debate of what
is medicine and how medicinal use is used,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about saying one use is and isn't
medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just about making sure we're giving
the topic the respect that it deserves so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're not inadvertently devaluing
some of its applications to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where the greater community doesn't think
that it's real anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in working with, with pediatrics,
you know, we see that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Valerie made a very good point that,
that there is this, we're always fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: this illusion that everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now cannabis is legalized and,
and, and a lot of the United States where
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's fine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now there's dispensaries and medical
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So medical patients are taken care of,
but what we see maybe more than other
[SPEAKER_01]: communities in, in pediatrics is really
how far away we are from being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with serious catastrophic
neurological conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give a couple examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that we're serving ongoing,
like 150 to 200 families.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do consultation and periodic help for,
for over a thousand families.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 1% of those families could
find and be okay with finding a CBD or
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture type product in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of them, what they take is not
available for a couple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, there's, there's dosage concentration
limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a problem in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I get calls from families there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is all of the community,
parents and cannabis community alike is
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part not up to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't even know that there's a
problem
[SPEAKER_01]: asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the Epidiolex trials that were
released last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's another problem where people
say, well, Epidiolex is out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a CBD, it's going to be available by
prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids are fine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are fine with epilepsy,
which, which is not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, the majority of them
don't respond to purified CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with those studies, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic dosing happens in a lot of,
anywhere up to 15 milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have nine year old, 10 year old
kids, you know, weighing a hundred pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to us with anywhere from 15 to 20
to 25 milligrams per pound dosage
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations sometimes from their
doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get those sort of
recommendations and they tie trade up to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they find efficacy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get that sort of dosage in any
dispensary in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would argue probably in the
United States because of dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you are needing a 1500 to 2000
milligram per day dosage dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: those things aren't readily available
because of the way we've structured
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this constant pushback against,
you know, everybody's taken care of and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's fine now because it's just
not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's, if you're lucky enough to
respond to CBD and my son doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 98% of the kids that we work
with don't respond to just CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's a difference between like
30% efficacy and where we want to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: the 80 and 90 percentile efficacy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see some benefit, that doesn't
mean that that's the right medicine for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is beneficial, but there is,
there are greater sets of relief out there
[SPEAKER_01]: with work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you get kids on specialized ratios,
whether it's a two to one or a 10 to one
[SPEAKER_01]: and different balances, but then you get
into needing specific terpene profiles as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as other aspects, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, some of the kids that we work
with respond to specific acidic to non
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic cannabinoid ratios, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning that there's this
synergistic effect and we have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways that we can change how they
interact with that one unique brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now on the shelves, we have CBD,
maybe a one to one oil at such a low
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration that it's not really
beneficial for therapeutic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're really far away from being
anywhere near being able to serve the
[SPEAKER_01]: community that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really a lack of
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as we can help people
recognize where the holes are and why,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can start to address those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, you know, it's really hard
to get any traction and that everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling to survive themselves or
they're excited about other aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is, you know, it's not as it's
not as not a lot of glory in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's not a lot of money in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's very hard to get some
traction, but you know what, for us,
[SPEAKER_06]: in my opinion, that's why groups like,
you know, my company and the company of
[SPEAKER_06]: many other people need to just sort of
buckle down and kick down and support
[SPEAKER_06]: these, these, these places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like I said, it's the front lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the, it's the, it's the group of
people that will actually get through the
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Hillary said it earlier,
how, you know, people have just been so
[SPEAKER_06]: afraid of THC and now these regulations of
having concentrate limits being limited
[SPEAKER_06]: and having edibles being limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, to me, it's as simple as simple
can be.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need exactly the models that,
that yourself and Valerie and Etienne and
[SPEAKER_06]: Hillary have, have done for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the flip side of it, I still see
it's not, I'm not on the fence or I guess
[SPEAKER_06]: I am on the fence.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not on either side of the fence
because here we have this huge division
[SPEAKER_06]: between licensed producers and dispensary
owners.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dispensary owners are like,
oh, the licensed producers are,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they're taking all our business.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not getting licensed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this whole, it almost probably would
be what the, the mom and pop dealers
[SPEAKER_06]: probably felt when people started opening
dispensaries because trust me,
[SPEAKER_06]: like one dispensary shut down two or 300
mom and pop dealers like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Overnight people that were paying their,
helping pay their rent and putting gas in
[SPEAKER_06]: their cars were, they were cut out of that
money because now people could go to these
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensaries and that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's, there's always sort of this
negative aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to see everyone be able to
play on an equal playing playing field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not as opposed to a giant company
like Canopy when I know they've got
[SPEAKER_06]: someone like Hillary in their ear,
that they've got DNA, that they've got
[SPEAKER_06]: Kurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And more importantly, what they recently
did, which I'll let Hillary speak on,
[SPEAKER_06]: because when you're a compassion club,
when Hillary opened the compassion club
[SPEAKER_06]: and would never take a penny of profit and
lived like a pauper and came from West
[SPEAKER_06]: Vancouver, which is like a nice
neighborhood and lived in East Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is like a harder neighborhood to
move to when you've been living your whole
[SPEAKER_06]: life in West Vancouver and lived on this
level and refused to take profits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when the club started selling a lot,
the profits went back into healers and
[SPEAKER_06]: people that could talk to the different
people who had different ailments or
[SPEAKER_06]: mental issues, mental health issues,
or they could get massages or they could
[SPEAKER_06]: get all these different aspects of healing
for free based on the small profit that
[SPEAKER_06]: was created in them buying the medicine in
the first place, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That should never go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're touching this group of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the flip side of that, you have a group
like Canopy just recently kicking down
[SPEAKER_06]: $2.5 million for this opioid addiction and
potential findings of cannabis being able
[SPEAKER_06]: to be helpful in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to speak on that a little bit,
Hillary?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, I mean, this kind of roots
back to what Val was just talking about in
[SPEAKER_14]: terms of the project that she is
initiating or re-initiating again.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of my inspiration from Val really
encouraged me a few decades ago to build
[SPEAKER_14]: the Wellness Centre at the Compassion
Club.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that Wellness Centre, I mean,
the Compassion Club in Vancouver was like
[SPEAKER_14]: the first sort of out of the closet pot
dealer in the country.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Wellness Centre is the thing that
was the spoonful of sugar that helped the
[SPEAKER_14]: medicine go down, I like to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that Wellness Centre gave us integrity
with the police and the medical
[SPEAKER_14]: organizations and the city.
[SPEAKER_14]: And even like last year, I've still like
rep that Compassion Club when I go to like
[SPEAKER_14]: speak to the Senate, we have the task
force come through that we're doing all
[SPEAKER_14]: the recommendations about what
legalization should look like.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's still doing sort of front lines,
political work, converting people to
[SPEAKER_14]: understanding like that cannabis is not
just, you know, like a party drug or
[SPEAKER_14]: something that has the risks that need to
be managed.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, you're sort of on a tear
today, Mark, about, you know, kicking down
[SPEAKER_14]: and donations.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, my hope is that this industry
will be come the most conscious,
[SPEAKER_14]: the most generous, the most socially
responsible industry in the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that even if we're not doing
it for altruistic reasons, for even if
[SPEAKER_14]: it's driven by economic incentive,
in terms of dissolving prohibition around
[SPEAKER_14]: the world, the thing that dissolves the
stigma that props up prohibition is
[SPEAKER_14]: generosity, social responsibility,
doing meaningful work inside communities
[SPEAKER_14]: and sharing the profits.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I choose to work in the heart of
the country and potentially world's
[SPEAKER_14]: biggest cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_14]: In some ways, it is the corporate machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a part of the like corporate
machinery that Val was talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for me, I know that I have a really
big responsibility to have a seat at the
[SPEAKER_14]: table to use my power that I do have
inside that company to drive really good
[SPEAKER_14]: work.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wish that Kirk was here for this
part, he would love to chime in and I'm
[SPEAKER_14]: sure he'll be back soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: But so for me, like when Canada we have
this crazy opioid overdose epidemic,
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's not just about people being
addicted to their pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_14]: but the street opioids we have,
the drug supply is poisoned.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's fentanyl that's in the drug
supply.
[SPEAKER_14]: The people are like being killed in
British Columbia faster.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're losing four people a day,
five people a day now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not just the like, it's not the
community of people that you expect it to
[SPEAKER_14]: be that is the impoverished mental health,
sort of more visible on the streets.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the fentanyl epidemic is touching
people in all walks of life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of those people that it touched
last year was my best friend's daughter.
[SPEAKER_14]: So her name is Gemma, and she died just
over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I took some time off from work,
because that's what you do when your best
[SPEAKER_14]: friend's daughter died.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hang on, I'm going to tell the story
without crying.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when I went back to work, I was gone
for about two months, when I went back to
[SPEAKER_14]: work, my team at Canopy said, Well,
what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, let's do something.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I phoned up some amazing friends
and colleagues of mine at the BC Centre of
[SPEAKER_14]: Substance Use, which is like a world's
leading organization around research
[SPEAKER_14]: around substance use disorders.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they helped me to put together a
project because I wanted to do something
[SPEAKER_14]: that was going to have ongoing impact.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we gifted $2.5 million to the
University of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the government in BC, the Ministry of
Mental Health and Addiction put in another
[SPEAKER_14]: half a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_14]: So pretty cool to have government money,
weed money, university coming together
[SPEAKER_14]: because this crisis really needs some
like, collaborative, innovative leadership
[SPEAKER_14]: and money, seriously needs money.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just don't seem to care enough about
people who are using drugs dying.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what we did is we created an
endowment.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that endowment is like a money
generating machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't just get spent, it basically
will support a professor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we created the Canopy Growth
Professorship of Cannabis Science.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this incredible man, M.J.
[SPEAKER_14]: Malloy, has now been announced as that
professor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And his research, the body of clinical
evidence that is being supported is about
[SPEAKER_14]: the role of cannabis in the opioid
overdose epidemic.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the clinical trials are not about
opioid sparing for pain patients,
[SPEAKER_14]: how you taper a pain patient off of their
opioids onto cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is about people who are addicted to
fentanyl and addicted to heroin.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of the trials will be about
substitution.
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of them will be about helping
adherence to other treatment programs
[SPEAKER_14]: because people who are addicted to
fentanyl have about like a 20 something
[SPEAKER_14]: percent success rate of staying on their
treatment programs.
[SPEAKER_14]: So my hope is that that clinical evidence,
it's not a quick fix.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like the people who are in the
downtown Eastside, which is the hardcore
[SPEAKER_14]: community, the hardcore neighborhood where
this epidemic is happening, who are doing
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis substitution projects.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is about systemic solution because I
want, my hope is that that body of
[SPEAKER_14]: clinical evidence will help healthcare
professionals around the world to know
[SPEAKER_14]: that cannabis is one of the tools that
they have when they're dealing with
[SPEAKER_14]: somebody who has any kind of a substance
use disorder, be it alcohol or opioids or
[SPEAKER_14]: benzos or fentanyl or crack cocaine or
anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we actually just announced M.J.
[SPEAKER_14]: just a week ago and I am profoundly proud
of my team at Canopy for ponying up that
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of dough.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we build out our global social
responsibility strategy, I hope and I
[SPEAKER_14]: believe that we'll continue to lead with
these kinds of initiatives because I want
[SPEAKER_14]: every cannabis company in the world,
whether you make hemp bomb lipsticks in
[SPEAKER_14]: your kitchen or you're an epic like
multi-million dollar international huge
[SPEAKER_14]: company for us to really be the most
generous, most amazing industry in the
world.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is true works of compassion
like Val's work and Forest's work and my
[SPEAKER_14]: compassion club's work that is breaking
down prohibition around the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all need to be like giving back in
a really significant way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was beautiful, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to realize that this division,
even within our own community,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, when Hillary announced this,
there were literally person after person
[SPEAKER_06]: after person, including well-known people
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Attacking her for naming it Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, you had to put your name in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, they don't they donated
two point five million dollars and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: setting up this whole amazing thing and
you're going to bash on them for like
[SPEAKER_06]: putting their name in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just seems so petty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's just these there's just this
crazy division in Canada, especially
[SPEAKER_06]: between the sort of homegrown dispensary
model and the LP and a lot of the LPs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are LPs that have brutal people
working for them where they're like
[SPEAKER_06]: ex-sheriffs or ex-police.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get, you know, people not having a
good feeling about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are LPs that were like just
black market growers that were like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to start an LP because I just
want to operate in a legal mechanism.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, I'm not for LPs at the expense
of dispensaries and home grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am for all access across the board in
any way that that looks like for you,
[SPEAKER_06]: because while some people are very happy
to touch the members of their community,
[SPEAKER_06]: there are other people that need to touch
members of as many communities as they
[SPEAKER_06]: can.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to touch hundreds of thousands.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to touch millions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't really shit on them for that
as long as their model doesn't drastically
[SPEAKER_06]: affect that small model of, you know,
grassroots like grassroots can never go
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, that certainly
doesn't stop the mighty oak tree from
[SPEAKER_06]: growing up nice and tall, does it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if there's a way to
get around the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of being the savior for the suffering
and sick and dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why it would want to not
take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of the cannabis community
is, for years, and Valerie spoke about
[SPEAKER_01]: this a little bit, has been really
outspoken against the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for a very justifiable reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They very clearly articulated how much
harm it was doing, how the monopolies
[SPEAKER_01]: damaged our community, how dangerous drugs
were damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: How profits were put ahead of patients'
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been something that's been
talked about openly for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now there's this situation where as
the, not only the legitimacy of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabinoid therapies as a medicine is
more widely accepted, but we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's even more powerful than we even
knew it was five, six, seven, 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that same option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the medical cure for some of the most
horrific diseases imaginable is in our
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately it's kind of like,
poof, we just see dollar signs,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's human nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmaceutical industry isn't a
separate beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just controlled by humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we can get into the
culture, this opportunity of one,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, if you're a good business person and
responsible, there's financial riches to
[SPEAKER_01]: be had out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like a little bit of that myself
at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, when you're dealing
with medicine and we're gonna call this
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and it is medicine, then there's
some responsibility and opportunity that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the examples I gave earlier was
the price problems with CBD where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: clinically shown therapeutic efficacy
versus what the cost is to get it into
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary if you can find it in
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me go back to that real quick just
to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have someone who's taking 1,500
milligrams a day or 2,500 milligrams a day
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD in our local dispensary,
that equals about eight bottles of the
[SPEAKER_01]: only whole plant CBD oil that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are about 80 bucks a piece,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about $640 or so a day
if my math is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you can get them to drop and
drink eight bottles a day, which you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes back to some of the problems
with the understanding of if there is
[SPEAKER_01]: access or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those doses are never gonna be
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have a business that has a
cost and people have to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just work for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a reality that is requiring
something that isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we solve that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that really where Hillary hit
it on the head is that if we come together
[SPEAKER_01]: and structure the system in a way that
subsidizes the needs for some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: critically ill in our communities,
we have an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be altruistic,
but to make a business model that gains
[SPEAKER_01]: public support, sways public support,
brings in prohibitionists, because you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see the good that they're doing by working
into that system, charity and benefit for
[SPEAKER_01]: people in their communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be done if our legislators
don't tax cannabis owners to death,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If everyone's not trying to squeeze every
penny from our legislators to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution everywhere, if everyone's
trying to squeeze every penny along the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain, well, then there's gonna be
nothing left for those in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we subsidize it appropriately so
that cultivators can affordably have 1% or
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% of their cultivators go to charitable
causes, and they're not just dying because
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't afford the taxes to even have a
single plant that isn't going back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulated market, then we can start to
produce cannabis and develop organizations
[SPEAKER_01]: that harness this market to meet those
people's needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the argument a lot of people have
is, well, then if we're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for it, then everyone's gonna say
they're medical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another damage that sort of the
medical system has done here in California
[SPEAKER_01]: at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last 20 years, if we give them
anything for free, then everyone's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have a backache again, and everyone's
gonna be medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have to reinvent the wheel
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like we're looking for this whole
new structural system with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have a structural system for
medication that will really address a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the issues we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus, you brought up edibles and dosing
limits, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're setting those dosing limits and
edibles at essentially over-the-counter
[SPEAKER_01]: strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't really determined and realized
yet that cannabis has potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: over-the-counter regulations where any mom
and dad and grandpa, anyone who walks in
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to try a gummy-ware, there we have
safety over-the-counter regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't set any of what we call the
prescription regulations yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who need higher dosage limits,
people who need, and justifiably need,
[SPEAKER_01]: but doctors support products that right
now they're saying are too dangerous to be
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can start to address the
over-the-counter versus prescription need
[SPEAKER_01]: of critically ill patients, make
responsible tax incentives and credits for
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry, we can make a pathway where
we could be as successful as we want and
[SPEAKER_01]: the heroes in our community at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can show that we value death,
that we value suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay lip service to seniors,
and we pay lip service to dying kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes down to it, they're
completely forgotten when there's a dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: to be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we set up these structures,
we can help all three of those communities
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just named and others that I
haven't while simultaneously being
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just takes, it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes hitting it on all levels,
which I've kind of burned myself out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been out on the last few years trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legislative, local, and in our
patient groups and educating through our
[SPEAKER_01]: patient groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's folks in this
room here who have been fighting the good
[SPEAKER_01]: fight and can help us do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to pipe up for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, in my life, was very inspired back in
the 90s when Valerie Corral got in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of trouble with the DEA for her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of what was so affecting to me
personally was witnessing the people she
[SPEAKER_00]: was helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like Hillary has been doing
the same thing in Vancouver, and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: Forrest is doing that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think an important part of this is
us being willing to step forward to make
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves public, not as perhaps as
business people, but as people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient compassion for the struggle
that some humans are dealing with and
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition of the fact that this plant
can help those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant is grown and prepared and
formulated in a way that is appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for the needs of the end user,
you can see miraculous things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone here has seen that happen in
their own lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is important about Hash Church
and the work that each of us as
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals have been doing is by
identifying people who have desperate need
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing benefit and sharing that
information with the public, be they
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitionists, be they other cannabis
workers, be they medical professionals,
[SPEAKER_00]: be they media people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, I think, an important part of
our work right now in our activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, Valerie, back in the 90s,
you changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You continue to inspire me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really glad to know of Hillary and
her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like we're at a point where
we have to educate about the real need
[SPEAKER_00]: that exists and the fact that
pharmaceuticals can do so much harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant, particularly when it is
properly formulated from plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: that's clean and free of contaminants,
can do amazing things for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to stop right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus, for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just watch some more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for sharing, Wade.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always appreciate your perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always sounds like it was well thought
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And welcome, Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Super important conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: We really appreciate all of you all that
are fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that I can say that Dragonfly Earth
Medicine and what we do really represents
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of the growers out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like we have a real problem in
legislation, like what everybody is
[SPEAKER_13]: saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now, the legislation is
basically cutting off the arms and the
[SPEAKER_13]: legs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the mobility of growers right now in
all areas that have recreational.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they're asking us to give more
and do more.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we know now that Washington has been
wrecked for I don't know how many years
[SPEAKER_13]: now, but 58 percent of the growers are no
longer in the business.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's ghost towns right now in
California that used to be totally
[SPEAKER_13]: thriving areas where businesses were doing
really well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you go into those small little towns
and they're totally ghost towns because of
[SPEAKER_13]: the regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel like we're getting hit on all
sides.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're talking about access,
access is becoming less and less in the
[SPEAKER_13]: hands of the small growers and of the
people who are growing responsibly and
[SPEAKER_13]: more and more in the hands of the
corporate model.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a legislative issue right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also look to safe access for the
earth in providing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little bit of an offshoot from
what we're talking about at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: But small farms have the ability to save
the earth and large agriculture is hard on
[SPEAKER_08]: is hard on the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're in a place where we're
healing each other, it makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: sense for us to see how we can heal the
earth at the same time, because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: another being which is taking a hit and is
sick on a lot of levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a tremendous amount of it's
really, really beautiful to see everyone
[SPEAKER_08]: in this room is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: To hear from you, Valerie, and I hope to
see you at the Emerald Cup this year is
[SPEAKER_08]: along with everyone else.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are all in different places within
this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really special that we do get to
come together to share our journey and our
[SPEAKER_08]: vision.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll just assure you that our
dedication to provide the safe medicine
[SPEAKER_08]: and work with farms to stay in business
will continue from us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we all can only do so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really are incredibly thankful to
you all, Hillary and ATN and Forrest and
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone here, Marcus, that you are all
doing what you're doing in your area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really by us coming together,
we really are supporting each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what's really important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're an incredibly resilient
community.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are an unbelievable, resilient
community.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have come from the black market.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have gone against all odds to sit here
in front of the screen to talk to so many
[SPEAKER_13]: other people who are in the same position
as us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also this plant is incredibly
resilient.
[SPEAKER_13]: She will make herself known no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how is it that we're going to handle
her?
[SPEAKER_13]: How are we going to give her the respect
that she deserves to be able to step into
[SPEAKER_13]: the market?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I truly believe that we haven't
given her that respect, not the small
[SPEAKER_13]: growers, not the people that are here on
this show today.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as far as like the legislative end of
it, the respect hasn't been given.
[SPEAKER_13]: Money has been first.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that we have this opportunity
to go hand in hand with the plant so that
[SPEAKER_13]: we can move forward in a way that's
respectful for the Earth, for the farmers,
[SPEAKER_13]: for the corporations, and definitely for
the patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess one more thing is it looks
like we are going to get pinched for a
[SPEAKER_08]: little while longer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be us suffering together on
one level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as long as we show each other the love
that we're talking about here,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's going to be the only inspiration that
we have to get through this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to continue to be that
voice of reason and really just empower
[SPEAKER_08]: each other on our mission.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because just like with growing,
it takes a lot of different modalities to
[SPEAKER_08]: make it healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to take a lot of modalities to
make this legalization work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working on it in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're also in Oregon right now and on
our way to California.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're very connected to the process of
providing this medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to do all we can with our
network of farms to support WAM,
[SPEAKER_08]: to support Valerie, to support Wave.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though you're in an area,
we can only have one plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that changes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, please be in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in touch with you all mostly anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we just really want to know how you
all could use our network to help you out
[SPEAKER_08]: and other people in other networks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right now, Dragonfly Earth Medicine
Peer Certification is over 80 farms deep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are doing the good work.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are doing what it takes to make a
difference on this planet and treat the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant with intention and respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trading seeds and swapping and
trading as stories of successes and
[SPEAKER_08]: failures and becoming better as a team.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to say we're doing the
mycelial work at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just knowing that as a lot of our
groups are in the legal market now,
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously, patients and terminally
ill children and adults are being forced
[SPEAKER_01]: into the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just important for us to keep that
conversation going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are all in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in most of the states in the United
States, it's relatively similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in California, as we get more and
more legalized, and this happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, it happened in Oregon,
the people who actually have critical care
[SPEAKER_01]: need are being forced further and further
into the black market because we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: not regulating responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the more that people with a
voice can always put that little asterisk
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, it keeps it in the public
awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is a shame that there's all
this topic about conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in the seventh largest... And no
one's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody out there, they can help just
keep that awareness would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, to add to what you're saying for us,
more and more patients are entering into
[SPEAKER_13]: the black market to try to fulfill their
needs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's what's happening to a lot of
growers to be able to fulfill the
[SPEAKER_13]: patients' needs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're really in the same position.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had hundreds of patients and
children that we've been working with.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just like what you all were saying
earlier on the show is that we're getting
[SPEAKER_13]: people writing us every day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a tremendous responsibility to
continue taking care of our patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: And where is the responsibility now?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you weigh it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like you've got a responsibility for
trying to be legal and play the system in
[SPEAKER_13]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have a tremendous responsibility to
continue to provide medicine to our
[SPEAKER_13]: patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a real conundrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's happening in Canada,
because I get calls and emails from
[SPEAKER_01]: families there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, I think some of the most we
get are the children with EB, the skin
[SPEAKER_01]: condition that I've really worked hard to
help families with over the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, hey, can you teach us how to
make the cream?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go see what is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see if we can find what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find out really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is needed for that level of care
versus what is available is just not
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that disconnect that I'm hoping
to help close the gap on and really help
[SPEAKER_01]: people understand that we almost don't
like the term legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we have legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very limited commercial allowance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of interaction with this plan
is absolutely illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be nitpicking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just seems like we're constantly
fighting that, oh, everything's fine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the general public, as soon as they
see any progress, they go, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have to worry about all those
folks anymore, because it's good now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how to fight that,
other than saying, well, we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily have what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't really have legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some very limited commercial
allowance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's so limited, things that
have been legal here in California for 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years are now completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually harder now than it was a
decade ago for us to treat the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: these laws were absolutely intended for in
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: California was the first in the United
States to have medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: when Dennis Perrone put this out for Dian
Aids patients and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the people who no longer
have access to what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are either going to ignore it and
look back on it and regret it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we're going to address it and stand up
and speak about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be at the Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not doing a booth this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to get to actually walk
around and spend time in the teepee.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can put your information at our
teepee, because we're making spaces for
[SPEAKER_08]: you and for other Purifars, because we
know that the Emerald Cup is different
[SPEAKER_08]: this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a big space.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to utilize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we're going to make space for
you, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to bring the conversation from
the micro to the macro.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as individuals and as people who
suffer, that is our story.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the work that we do is the way that we
reach human beings, the way that we touch
[SPEAKER_12]: one another's heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's kind of the intimate connection
that we have from human to human.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the story of suffering always,
not always, but primarily ignites an
[SPEAKER_12]: emotional response from others.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we look to that because that's how we
connect eye to eye and passion.
[SPEAKER_12]: But however, I want to pull it back to the
macro, because where I think that it is
[SPEAKER_12]: profoundly important to push back against
the corporate state.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, let me make a distinction here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wham's a corporation.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not saying that every corporation
is the doomsayer for smaller business.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying that.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I do believe that if we are ever
to be able to turn this corporate monster
[SPEAKER_12]: on its head to flip it so that there is
space for compassionate action and access,
[SPEAKER_12]: not just to cannabis, but compassionate
access to life for human beings,
[SPEAKER_12]: for all living creatures, for every
sentient being, for the planet itself as a
[SPEAKER_12]: sentient being, then it's our job,
it's my job at least, to speak against the
[SPEAKER_12]: profound and innate evil that is part of
the corporate lack of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we are looking at and what we are
being affected by is so profoundly huge
[SPEAKER_12]: that when we look, when we see only from
our own perspective, which is really all
[SPEAKER_12]: we can do, but when we see only from that
perspective, then we are trying to find
[SPEAKER_12]: our place in a structure that always
minimizes who we are as individuals,
[SPEAKER_12]: as small business people, as the people
who are suffering.
[SPEAKER_12]: The response, now I want to, I commend and
I agree that we need to inspire
[SPEAKER_12]: corporations, large corporations,
big business, to do good, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We want them to do good.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, and anytime that we can do that,
that is a profoundly important thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there are several things that are at
cost here and are at stake.
[SPEAKER_12]: To begin, one is that we're removing,
we're taking all these sacred medicines.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, all plants are sacred, it's nature,
but poison oak is sacred, all of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're taking this, we're removing it
from its place in nature and the Shaman,
[SPEAKER_12]: the knowers, the keepers of wisdom,
we're taking them, removing them,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we're putting these plants into the
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what happens when we do that?
[SPEAKER_12]: What occurs when we do that?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're removing the connection to the
sentient part of plants because,
[SPEAKER_12]: for instance, that's the way we look at
animals.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, animals aren't smart because they
don't speak English or they don't speak
[SPEAKER_12]: Spanish.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't speak an oral language that we
understand.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we try to train them to speak the
language that we speak without
[SPEAKER_12]: understanding that they have their own
communication, their own systems.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's what we do as human beings in our
infinite wisdom and our lack of our
[SPEAKER_12]: inability to connect deeply to why we do
psychedelics and why we take this plant to
[SPEAKER_12]: that space, let it take us, excuse me,
to that space of deep, to incite our
[SPEAKER_12]: wisdom, to inspire us to listen deeply.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that, I think it is time to say
no to the corporate state, to say no,
[SPEAKER_12]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do this and we will do it so much
better than you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ramdas, you said, he used to sit before a
stroke.
[SPEAKER_12]: He sat on many boards.
[SPEAKER_12]: He sat on a Turner board, TMT,
that board, to keep, why, to keep the
[SPEAKER_12]: heart in the boardroom, to bring it in
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you're talking about billions of
dollars, where's the heart?
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's that language?
[SPEAKER_12]: Who speaks it?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we say it?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we remind one another?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that it is to not,
I mean, I don't condemn anybody for doing
[SPEAKER_12]: it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that it has to be done to take
part at that table in that boardroom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Last place I would ever want to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, last place is in a political position.
[SPEAKER_12]: So second to the last place I would ever
want to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it is of profound importance
to say no and to define, to take on our
[SPEAKER_12]: role.
[SPEAKER_12]: California, I take a personal,
I feel very personal about this.
[SPEAKER_12]: California blew it, massively blew it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had such a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_12]: To do good and we chose to do money.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they separate?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they exclusive from one another?
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have to be, but they have been.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying us in this
conversation, this conversation is so
[SPEAKER_12]: remarkable and I'm so grateful to be
sitting at the table with all of you and
[SPEAKER_12]: recognize that nothing is done alone,
that I never did anything alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've always done it in the company of God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Greatness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my most profound teachers are the
people who have faced death and done what
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope to do a good job at.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yet here we sit and, well, I mean,
I'm just going to go on and sound like I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: bashing corporations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in many ways I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am saying you have done a bad job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Amazon can get something to my door.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I pick on Amazon every day I try to.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of my mantras.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you Donald Trump because he brings
up emotions in me that I really don't want
[SPEAKER_12]: to feel.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to have invading my life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those things that we look at in our lives
and the way that we can change what is
[SPEAKER_12]: profoundly the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk about saving the planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we really mean save the people.
[SPEAKER_12]: My ex-husband Mike used to say that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We really mean save us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give us a place in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make us, give us what we want so that we
can thrive.
[SPEAKER_12]: And unless we thrive together and
recognize that we cannot thrive
[SPEAKER_12]: individually, that that's not thriving,
then I think that we are on a very,
[SPEAKER_12]: a course to eliminate our, personally to
eliminate our ability to have help other
[SPEAKER_12]: than just, you know, crossing the street,
helping someone across the street.
[SPEAKER_12]: We must really find the ways to infiltrate
and flip this, this thought, this idea
[SPEAKER_12]: that the best way to thrive is to make the
most that you can make.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying that that's happening in
our group, but I think that it is
[SPEAKER_12]: profoundly important that we stand up to
it and say no, and you're doing it
[SPEAKER_12]: completely wrong and you're doing it all
wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that may leave us vulnerable again,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, Forrest?
[SPEAKER_12]: It leaves us vulnerable again because
we're not protected.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not protected.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we've done the same work
for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've always helped people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once a week we have a community meeting.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of our members come blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_12]: All those things that you do to build
community, which is a safe place to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: The more of us there are, the greater
number, the more power that we have.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would say that we already have that
power, that we are already great in
[SPEAKER_12]: numbers and that we already feel very much
the same way, if not exactly the same,
[SPEAKER_12]: but our intention is there to be,
to create the world that we can thrive in
[SPEAKER_12]: where the world itself as a single body
thrives, because all of us are in
[SPEAKER_12]: compliment with that consciousness and
awareness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And because we influence, infiltrate and
influence those who are not yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, everybody dies and I watch
people, I've been at over 200 deathbeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: You die the way you live.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great opportunity to pull your shit
together, but if we haven't been working
[SPEAKER_12]: hard to achieve that or working to achieve
that, it can become a great puzzle.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying I'd do a great job.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that I'd probably do a
terrible job if that happens today,
[SPEAKER_12]: but this ultimate goal is to not watch our
work die because it is controlled by those
[SPEAKER_12]: who are motivated strictly by profit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, shout out to Terrence McKenna.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did mention psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can never be mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't mention psychedelics without me
mentioning Terrence McKenna.
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge inspiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: My life listening to him and Rupert
Sheldrake and Ralph Abraham talk at the
[SPEAKER_06]: SLM Institute talks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Google them if you haven't heard of them,
hash church watchers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back, Kirk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Little kid duty there.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the many, one of your many 16
children as Hillary was joking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it feels like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we were, we were missing you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a few good conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: That came up where we were like,
Oh, it would be good if Kirk was in the
[SPEAKER_06]: room to talk about this right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't mind chiming in on this issue
of corporations because it's an
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting one to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I'll put this out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A corporation is nothing more than a group
of people that have come together to
[SPEAKER_09]: achieve a common purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's given a legal structure within most
countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the world and to focus on North
America, it's given a certain legal
[SPEAKER_09]: structure so that people can come together
and achieve that common purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, traditionally the common purpose of a
corporation has been to maximize the
[SPEAKER_09]: profit of shareholders, the people that
have equity in that corporation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's probably how 90 plus percent of
the corporations in the world are
[SPEAKER_09]: organized.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's their purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't necessarily have to be
their purpose.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can come together and an association
to try to not maximize profits,
[SPEAKER_09]: but rather maximize the sort of good you
do in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think like all sort of human
endeavors, the good or evil that a
[SPEAKER_09]: corporation does in the world is
determined almost exclusively by the good
[SPEAKER_09]: or evil that the people involved in that
corporation want to do in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that way, it's no different than
any association of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think where we sort of go wrong in our
society is that we've privileged
[SPEAKER_09]: corporations that seek profit in a variety
of ways within our sort of legal
[SPEAKER_09]: structures.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've given them eternal life.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have imposed duties upon directors to
maximize profits.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have treated them like people rather
than legal entities.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've given them massive tax
advantages that we don't provide to
[SPEAKER_09]: ordinary people.
[SPEAKER_09]: All those things are changeable,
but they're also all sort of divorced from
[SPEAKER_09]: the conversation of what is a corporation
and is it intrinsically good or evil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Fresh Hatties is a corporation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always hear people be like, wow,
what about those corporate?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, you mean like the corporate
douchebags.
[SPEAKER_06]: There should be like a different title
where you can be a corporation or you can
[SPEAKER_06]: be like corporate douchebags because we
know some corporations, just like some
[SPEAKER_06]: people, aren't good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we know other ones that are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are ones, no matter how
good they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was mentioning this earlier when Hillary
mentioned that Canopy was going to donate
[SPEAKER_06]: two and a half million to the project of
opioids at UBC that I saw immediately on
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter, just her taking fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, you guys had to name it Canopy
Grove.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, yeah, we donated the
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is that too much of a connection?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we like, are we I just thought it was
amazing that even, you know, Canopy gets
[SPEAKER_06]: called out for everything, no matter what
they do, but even like a good thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: like they make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Canopy makes a mistake,
they take like a serious beating,
[SPEAKER_06]: like because there's this whole division.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it, this division.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kirk also just takes a beating sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll just write the most innocent thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people will just be like,
you know, Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson
[SPEAKER_06]: were talking about this the other day and
how it's this man, you got to bring that
[SPEAKER_09]: dude back up again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, listen, the conversation was really
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really good conversation in
regards to people responding on the
[SPEAKER_06]: Internet to certain things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you pay too much attention to them,
you can think, wow, am I like a really bad
[SPEAKER_06]: person?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting a lot of hate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you start it starts creating doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just it's not really this
necessarily accurate thing when the people
[SPEAKER_06]: who are the most angry, who have the most
energy to share are not an accurate
[SPEAKER_06]: representation of the rest of the people
that actually are thinking about these
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they get warped, particularly in the
person's mind who's taking the firing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Joe Rogan said to Jordan,
like, you just can't read that stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: like otherwise it could just drive you
completely mental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're often least appreciated
about the subjects, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, there's some justified
anger out there as well directed towards
[SPEAKER_09]: many, including, frankly, Jordan Peterson.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't want this conversation to
address too far down that path.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it already has.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: If any of you are unfamiliar with his
work, I'd suggest remaining that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But but yeah, I mean, listen, it's you
know, I'm not immune to going out there
[SPEAKER_09]: and provoking some of it as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be fair.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think you have to sort of look at
things in terms of their actions.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we if we want to solve the problems of
sort of the corporate superstructure and
[SPEAKER_09]: the capitalist superstructure that we have
in our society.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I heard somebody say this at a Drug
Policy Alliance conference more than 10
[SPEAKER_09]: years ago now, I guess we're talking about
legalization then.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looked, frankly, like it wasn't
coming any time soon anywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, there was there was this
sort of eternal discussion about whether
[SPEAKER_09]: corporate interests should be permitted to
or cheered for supporting legalization
[SPEAKER_09]: initiatives because they are
self-interested when doing so.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the guy stood up and he
said, look, you know, this plant sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: illegal everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's putting an awful lot on
the plant to not only become legal and
[SPEAKER_09]: stop arresting people just for having it
in their pocket, but also solve all the
[SPEAKER_09]: problems that exist because of our sort of
history as a species and the existing
[SPEAKER_09]: economic superstructures that we labor
under and capitalism in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I took that to heart then.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I and I sort of still believe it now
that I think when people consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: pathways in their mind open up that allow
them to contemplate other ways of being
[SPEAKER_09]: and other ways about thinking about those
issues, those those major issues in our
[SPEAKER_09]: world.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also don't know that we should be
expecting to achieve some of the massive
[SPEAKER_09]: reforms that we need as a species on the
backs of this legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a small piece of a bigger puzzle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think sometimes that gets confused.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's not legalization,
but regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a regulation market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And corporations are totally can be good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really definitely not a thing
about just saying corporations are bad or
[SPEAKER_08]: good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we can all agree that it's it's
it's the energy behind the corporation
[SPEAKER_08]: that would make it good or bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's up to the individual to find out
what that means.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that oftentimes that that
structure tends to overtake.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the case of regular regulation
and cannabis, what we have with the larger
[SPEAKER_08]: corporations is a disconnect from the
medicine and the medicine makers that
[SPEAKER_08]: brought it forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like you have this umbrella of of
lawmakers and corporations, but there's
[SPEAKER_08]: the disconnect because they're not
providing any of this medicine that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: all talking about is saving everyone's
lives.
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're what they're what they're
doing is they're providing a pathway for
[SPEAKER_08]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we provide the correct amount of
of dots and eyes, we can provide taxation
[SPEAKER_08]: to the system to allow us to to provide
our medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now we're at a point where we're
just kind of trying to figure out the
[SPEAKER_08]: system.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so we have corporations that
have been in Canada that have been
[SPEAKER_08]: existing for years now, and they're
totally having all their stuff figured
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the and from our perspective,
the true medicine makers are now just
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then so it just creates a that's where
the energy comes from of like,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, God, these corporations are killing
us, you know, and it makes it really
[SPEAKER_08]: difficult to feel like everyone is kind of
doing a part to make it better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what we're talking
about here is all of us are kind of doing
[SPEAKER_08]: our part to make it better.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just at a point where it's really
difficult to find value between each
[SPEAKER_08]: other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we're just like, oh,
God, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: what have you done?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, but, you know, we're also,
you know, creating this community right
[SPEAKER_08]: here to empower each other.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and I think that, you know,
I think I'll be brave enough just to talk
[SPEAKER_13]: about the elephant in the room is that I'm
sorry, but what corporation forms to not
[SPEAKER_13]: make money is their number one thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very few of these huge, large corporations
that have been set up in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Their number one goal is not medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not safe access.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not safe for the for the earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's making money because that's what
corporations do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that we have a bigger
responsibility as corporations.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Dragonfly Earth Medicine were
also a corporation, you know, because we
[SPEAKER_13]: had to become incorporated to even be able
to step into this market.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was like the path was already laid
out for us as growers, as medicine makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just don't think that that path was
necessarily a path that the plant wants us
[SPEAKER_13]: to go down, that this sentient being wants
us to go down, that the patients want us
[SPEAKER_13]: to go down.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like we do have a social
responsibility to the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we do have a social responsibility
to the patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't believe that the corporations
that are in cannabis are upholding those
[SPEAKER_13]: social responsibilities right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that they have, you know,
openings of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that they may wake up one
morning and say, yeah, OK, I've got a
[SPEAKER_13]: social responsibility.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not downing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's absolutely imperative
that they do show something of intention
[SPEAKER_13]: and goodness.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that we can do better.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that we can all do better as large
corporations.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to do better.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Kelly, you just pulled out like exactly
why I am where I am.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Val said a little while ago that
the last place she wants to be as a
[SPEAKER_14]: politician and the second last place that
she wants to be is in a boardroom,
[SPEAKER_14]: navigating, working inside a corporate
structure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've chosen to take that on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not always easy and it's not
always fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like learning a whole new
language and a whole new landscape.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd kind of rather be in a garden,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I see that there are massive economic
drivers that are making other countries
[SPEAKER_14]: around the world start looking at
repealing prohibition and that there are
[SPEAKER_14]: other governments that are not looking at
repealing prohibition because it's the
[SPEAKER_14]: right thing to do or because of the
tremendous amount of harms that the drug
[SPEAKER_14]: war have done, but that they're motivated
to start looking at changing the
[SPEAKER_14]: regulatory framework because there are
economic drivers to becoming a part of
[SPEAKER_14]: what is going to be a global industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the force of capitalism,
what you're talking about inside,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, like why corporations are formed
and what the focus of most of them are.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's this huge force of energy that is
driving change around the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to see cannabis legalized
and regulated in a way that is like
[SPEAKER_14]: reflective of this plant that honors the
plant and respects the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not about we're going to legalize
cannabis in a way that manages the risks
[SPEAKER_14]: of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a huge compromise.
[SPEAKER_14]: Having other countries looking at changing
the regulatory framework because they're
[SPEAKER_14]: driven by wanting to be a part of a global
economy is not the right reason to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But is it harm reduction?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it like starting to create change and
evolution like the legal framework that we
[SPEAKER_14]: have in Canada?
[SPEAKER_14]: We know all of the reasons and all of the
places why it needs to keep evolving and
[SPEAKER_14]: where we need to keep working.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like Kirk's awesome rant about
us being able to teach our children how to
[SPEAKER_14]: use cannabis safely and the like what
we're talking about around the inclusion
[SPEAKER_14]: of like all of the small farms and
regulating cannabis production in a way
[SPEAKER_14]: where we're taking care of the earth.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not hurting it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's the end of my rant.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that I could wrap it up
nicer than to say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: you and you and I talk about this offline.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like trying to create the same kind
of change from very different places.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this phase of my activism is
challenging and and I wouldn't want to be
[SPEAKER_14]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear 100 percent Hillary as they,
you know, I guess I'm the face here of
[SPEAKER_07]: corporate cannabis here because I do have
a dispensary and I have navigated through
[SPEAKER_07]: the very expensive and very difficult way
of finally appearing in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Valerie, we have never forgotten who
we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Berkeley Patients Group,
it's in our name.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still provide free medicine to over 250
patients weekly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was definitely, as you know,
for us had made more challenging and we
[SPEAKER_07]: had to make them actually get state cards
because of the loophole they had to go
[SPEAKER_07]: through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a few people couldn't make that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was painful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that didn't stop us from putting,
you know, A and B together so that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they're taken care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is still an underground network,
you know, with under with legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said there was at least a third of
the network was still going to stay
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the reality that's transpired.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, we're volunteering our
weekends to teach teachers and doctors
[SPEAKER_07]: right now because there's no education now
that there has been pulled cannabis from
[SPEAKER_07]: its reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: We created our own syllabus and we're
trying to educate the educators because
[SPEAKER_07]: they have no information out there to
teach these kids anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't know about their laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all they see is these kids are using
vaporizers in classes now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've been able to challenge that
and them.
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of that, we had a group of heart
surgeons come to us out of curiosity
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's no access of information
in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've just taken it internally and gone
to becoming educators where we volunteer
[SPEAKER_07]: our space and our weekends and our time so
that they can come.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've been flocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we had a whole swath of health
educators from seventh grade all the way
[SPEAKER_07]: to seniors in high school that need the
most basic information.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can be good corporate people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Berkeley Patients Group was always a
corporation, but we were acted as a
[SPEAKER_07]: nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still give everything away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still give to many organizations and
still try to do things right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, we try to lead by
example and not many people are listening
[SPEAKER_07]: to our examples.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not going to stop us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to cause us from moving in
our reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it sucks being in board
meetings and having to do the,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the corporate things you have to
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a better voice, no better voice than
ours that have been through the thick of
[SPEAKER_07]: it to actually be there to hold people
accountable.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need bigger voices.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've been saying from the
beginning that the biggest sufferers are
[SPEAKER_07]: the dosage reality, limited people,
because I deal with patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have quadriplegic patients who need and
require a high dosage cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have to put them in touch with
people so that they have to now go to the
[SPEAKER_07]: underground network and, you know,
have people make this that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other put, you know, chemists in
touch with people so that they can do as
[SPEAKER_07]: best they can reformulate things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the grassroots never stops.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, there's too few of us
holding that light in the dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's getting harder and harder with
these corporate rules, the cannabis that
[SPEAKER_07]: we grew or processed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had in certain price points that we
have 20 plus almost years of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: knowing what should be a quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're seeing nowhere near the quality
and the price ranges of what we're left
[SPEAKER_07]: with, the distribution realities that
we're, you know, we're forced to deal
[SPEAKER_07]: with.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're doing the best that we can in the
limited realities that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we hear you, Forrest,
and we hear you, Valerie, and we're trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to do the best we can with the realities
that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we can't do everything,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, a lot of the problem is
regulatory requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we got some great dispensary
owners in our area here, but there's only
[SPEAKER_01]: so much you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the penalties are so big for violating
a lot of those rules that you can't risk
[SPEAKER_01]: all the work that's been done to violate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, I'm really glad to
hear that you're doing that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope other owners out there hear that
because it's absolutely necessary,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I sit on a lot of panels when
I'm invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some with the school districts
up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've just heard the most
ridiculous stats and figures about risk
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of their mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure, Aitin, you've seen this,
but it's always when they ask them,
[SPEAKER_01]: where are you getting this information,
it's from Sam every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's the only, you know,
it's the only really good, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go find negative propaganda, that's where
everyone ends up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we're teaching our kids
just absolute false realities with this
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda information that isn't,
it's been discredited time and time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they, and then they wonder
why cannabis or other drugs have a
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation as a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's, keep telling them,
if you lie to children, well, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gateway longer again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go out and have an
experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that everything you told
them was a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're going to think that
everything about these other drugs is a
[SPEAKER_01]: lie as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they must've been lying about
methamphetamines, and they must've been
[SPEAKER_01]: lying about heroin and these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the damage done is very significant,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I hope that- And we are
lying about those other drugs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to a certain extent, yeah,
absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a difference in risk
and harm and use, but yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, being able to get that
education out there is important.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try on the board of the
next international cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_07]: association, and they want to adopt our
syllabus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And our syllabus is basically from the
internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the National Institute of Health,
all their negative stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we got all, a lot of the other
positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we balanced it out along with a lot of
links so that they can also go and do
[SPEAKER_07]: their research.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're hoping is the NCIA adopts it
so that in all 50 states, they'll have the
[SPEAKER_07]: access of the syllabus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're going to try and do a
training video.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so anybody can then take this
information and then go out there and do
[SPEAKER_07]: it themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can regionally do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a way that we're trying to
find a way to locally activate people by
[SPEAKER_07]: giving them the knowledge and at least
information so that they can then go with
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a lot of these people in all these
states have become good communicators
[SPEAKER_07]: regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just they need better tools and
there's no tools out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So until the state of California gets it
up to date, we're the ones filling in that
[SPEAKER_07]: void.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very introductory, but I think it's a
little past the OU state of education.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's still a lot people have to
gain on themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's why we try to impart them
with a little bit of that in the syllabus
[SPEAKER_07]: so that they can research further.
[SPEAKER_07]: But no one hasn't come away from it better
for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after we do that, we actually,
we kind of cheat and then we take them
[SPEAKER_07]: through the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we show them what the cannabis
looks like because majority of these
[SPEAKER_07]: doctors and teachers have never seen what
cannabis looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they're all whipping out their
cameras.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look, I've never seen a gram of
cannabis looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was much more than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you show them an ounce so that
they see and it dispels a lot of that
[SPEAKER_07]: information that they've been told.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as you stated, you were amazed at
the stupidity that we hear back from
[SPEAKER_07]: people all the time regarding their lies
and misinformation that they ask
[SPEAKER_07]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's challenging, but it's something we
volunteer and we do out of the love of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the education that needs to be
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we don't do it, who else is
going to?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, as smoking circles,
they'll fill you with so much
[SPEAKER_07]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what started me in the first
place, hearing that I smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would bring a career with his book
Emperor's No Clothes says that stupid boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if he hadn't been there to
slap me over the head with that book,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be, you know, so, you know,
that education, we're trying to be that
[SPEAKER_07]: hundredth monkey, that millionth monkey
that takes that information and then parts
[SPEAKER_07]: on somebody so that they can take it and
run with it and be that spark.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done all I can at a certain resolve.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need others to have fire and spread
that fire within their local community.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the best way we can find is,
like I said, through teachers and through
[SPEAKER_07]: doctors in the underground teaching way,
if you can believe that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a lot of ways, that's the real fun of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I bet Hillary enjoys that a lot
because that's a real important part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the work that she does.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we were in Vancouver last at the
Cannabis Hemp Expo, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: doctors there that really are basically
just coming awake to the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really now the opportunity, you know,
they have the ability to, they're now able
[SPEAKER_08]: to connect with the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're seeing a lot of doctors that
really have alienated themselves from it
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now they're almost hungry for the
information because I think that doctors
[SPEAKER_08]: are partly trapped.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, doctors are similar to this
cannabis we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trapped by their system.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a ton of things doctors can't do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a ton of areas that they've
taken themselves out of being healers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think doctors initially were meant
to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we're seeing a whole new
demographic maybe of elders that didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke or ingest before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of elders that are just
experiencing it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's a tremendous need for
people to just travel around and talk to
[SPEAKER_08]: people in Oklahoma and North Carolina,
all these states that are just opening up
[SPEAKER_08]: right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're partly saturated in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just waiting for the next thing to
come out to learn the new bit of
[SPEAKER_08]: information.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's like, you say, ATN,
a whole world of people out there that are
[SPEAKER_08]: just awakening to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, that's the real fun part of it
all in a way, because you get to see
[SPEAKER_08]: people become awake to something that can
help them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you see incredible changes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can only imagine what forest has
seen over the newest changes that have
[SPEAKER_08]: come.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to, as we move forward,
just recognize what we're all seeing.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm saying here is we are having
successes with the legalization and the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulation in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we just need to continue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though we're not sleeping now,
we have to continue not sleeping to
[SPEAKER_08]: continue to create the access to the
medicine of the people.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to jump in.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to, first of all, clarify that when
speaking of corporations, and I agree with
[SPEAKER_12]: you, Marcus, there should be a distinction
between corporation and corporation.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I said I would not want to be sitting
on the board, I would not want to be
[SPEAKER_12]: sitting on the board of Amazon to be their
conscience, because that's not my work.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe if Jeff Bezos ever dies,
then yeah, if he's dying, I could be by
[SPEAKER_12]: his bedside.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would find that an honor.
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest of it, for me personally,
is not my work.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not where I can thrive, nor do I feel
that I could serve the greatest capacity.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my personal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we are not the enemy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hillary, what you're doing and have been
doing, the way that you've set your course
[SPEAKER_12]: and followed it is remarkable and it's
admirable.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is what each of us is doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's my perception of the work
of each of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Tian, of course, that is, you guys
continue to thrive by doing your good work
[SPEAKER_12]: and never turning your back on need.
[SPEAKER_12]: So need has many edges and sides,
and it's an endless well.
[SPEAKER_12]: And our capacity to serve and to fill that
takes an endless force of humanity.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the inspiration that we can provide is
through our work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the best thing that we can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know that I have nothing to
teach.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not a teacher.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just a student here in this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I continue to be taught by my powerful
human beings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sister, you taught us all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you realize everybody sitting before
you is because of your inspiration and
[SPEAKER_07]: what you did and the light that you held
in the darkness that touched all of our
[SPEAKER_07]: torches.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we held our lights, too, for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Valerie, 100%.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've passed on the light to all of our
candles.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have been an incredible mentor and
teacher, I know, to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would do anything to support you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why I think I'm calling out
that we push back against.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, when I found out, it was last year,
I guess, Monsanto is working directly with
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeffrey Guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to admit, the only time I met
Jeffrey Guy, I wouldn't say he and I
[SPEAKER_12]: agreed fully.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do agree, and I do support the use of
medicine and the access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that medical cannabis is an
important piece.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason I feel it is important for
me to change language is because when I
[SPEAKER_12]: see that legalization and under regulation
have nothing to do with freedom.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have everything to do with control.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to instruct us, all of us that have
done so much work have had our feet on the
[SPEAKER_12]: ground and had the heads of the human
beings that are suffering in our laps and
[SPEAKER_12]: held an opportunity to serve people in the
greatest possible way.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the capacity that we can to be subject
to a body of rules that not only restricts
[SPEAKER_12]: but prevents us from doing the work that
we need to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is in part, my belief, been
instituted by the corporate state,
[SPEAKER_12]: meaning the bad boys, and I say boys,
sorry, my sexism.
[SPEAKER_12]: The bad doers of the managers and
controllers of the corporate state.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I say corporate state,
I mean those corporations who influence
[SPEAKER_12]: politics.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it isn't me, it isn't you,
it isn't our corporations that are
[SPEAKER_12]: necessarily influencing politics.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Hilary, I agree with you, we need to.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to influence that politic.
[SPEAKER_12]: But they are not hearing how to serve they
are hearing the fears that governments
[SPEAKER_12]: always hear around abuse and lack of
control.
[SPEAKER_12]: And abuse is often considered abuse
because there is a lack of control by
[SPEAKER_12]: those that are the torch bearers for that
control, for holding a line.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when I heard that Monsanto was
working with, you know, had now created
[SPEAKER_12]: the genetically modified medicines,
plants, that are the medicine to be
[SPEAKER_12]: delivered by GW Pharmaceutical,
both in America as soon as it becomes
[SPEAKER_12]: legal, which it obviously will,
it will become a pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_12]: then I felt it's, I'm correct in changing
language from medical cannabis to
[SPEAKER_12]: phytotherapies because it is a plant and
because what we serve is a deeper,
[SPEAKER_12]: it is the health of mind, the health of
body, the health of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a deeper relationship on the human
level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it also is the health and welfare
of our nations, of our planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is far more complex than our
language allows, or my language allows me
[SPEAKER_12]: to speak to.
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that in mind, and this is another
piece that I think is so valuable,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it is an imperative to work in the
realm of trade, that we barter and trade
[SPEAKER_12]: outside of this failure of capitalism.
[SPEAKER_12]: Capitalism is innate, has an innate,
it's innately flawed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it does not value wellness.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does not value happiness.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has no means by which to measure the
profit, the true profit of a healthy and
[SPEAKER_12]: thriving humanity and planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why it is innately flawed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why I think it needs to be
turned on its head.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why I think it's our job to do
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, drop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think as humans, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: We continue to build fences, but yet we
want to be free.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're a very interesting species.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also just really appreciate
everything you said.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just feel like it's safe to say that
at this point, since legalization,
[SPEAKER_08]: we've lost access.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this point, we've lost access.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have to do all we can to gain it
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you, the best access I have
experienced in this 25 to 30 years
[SPEAKER_06]: experience that I've had was getting my
MMR.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting my MMR was like, wait a minute,
so I can grow cannabis and then I can
[SPEAKER_06]: possess cannabis anywhere I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then thanks to Owen Smith and the good
group of lawyers that represented him,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of a sudden you could process
cannabis, which was just this
[SPEAKER_06]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't need to sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just happy to be able to possess it,
to be able to grow it, to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: process it.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that was a huge step in changing my
perspective and my perception on cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: and feeling that constant feeling of like,
before that, I always felt like I was
[SPEAKER_06]: going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so paranoid driving, especially once
I got pulled over at my roadblock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was actually with six kilos,
sorry, not three.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just was this crazy fear that I
thought, wow, this is just me being afraid
[SPEAKER_06]: for my own person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine how much of this vibration is
currently happening on the planet in
[SPEAKER_06]: countries like Malaysia, where they hang
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: In countries or states like Alabama,
where they just give you 10 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, you had six kilos?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, well, you get 10 years and you get
10 years and you get 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to be able to remove myself a
little bit from that frequency was huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you talk about legalization
when, when you get, you know, the fact
[SPEAKER_08]: that people aren't getting arrested,
that if we could combine that feeling of
[SPEAKER_08]: not getting arrested with the feeling of
having an MMAR and then the feeling of
[SPEAKER_08]: being able to grow like herb on your own
land.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could combine all three of those
things, you know, along with the access I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean, now we're talking about legalization
and true freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, right now we're dying.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're dying without medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're dying as a farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting crushed right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really, really difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're still drinking good drinks
and eating good food to keep the vibes
[SPEAKER_08]: going.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's something that we
really are having to work really hard to
[SPEAKER_08]: gain that access back.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Forrest, I would love to do,
if we could do one thing in life,
[SPEAKER_08]: it would just be grow medicine and give it
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there was like a magic fairy that
could just put enough money in our bank
[SPEAKER_08]: account to like, you know, pay off the
other things, that would be fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would just grow and develop strains and
give all the weed away so we could save
[SPEAKER_08]: humans beings on earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we would do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say that's just the sort of
difficult reality of the superstructure.
[SPEAKER_09]: The structures that we live in,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because legally in Canada right now,
you can grow medicine and give it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're absolutely legally permitted to do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can even grow sort of an MMAR
amount of medicine and give it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Either in the designated caregiver role
that's allowed to you or simply because
[SPEAKER_09]: you can now give away cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the difficulty, of course, is you got
to pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the structure that we in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if you want to pay your bills also
by growing cannabis, now we've moved into
[SPEAKER_09]: a situation where we have a regulated
market for doing so that is incredibly
[SPEAKER_09]: difficult to access and far too difficult
to access, which I think goes back to sort
[SPEAKER_09]: of Hillary's point of there has to
continue to be progress made in allowing
[SPEAKER_09]: people to participate in this in an
economic way so that they can pay their
[SPEAKER_09]: bills and achieve their goals,
whatever those goals happen to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we're now at a place where we
can have that conversation instead of the
[SPEAKER_09]: old conversation, which was everybody
involved in this industry is a criminal
[SPEAKER_09]: and marijuana is a criminal activity and
it's all crime.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the beauty of legalization
sort of spreading and I think it's
[SPEAKER_09]: accelerating.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the spread of legalization is
accelerating in a highly regulated manner
[SPEAKER_09]: is that you now are able to take cannabis
out of the category of criminal as a
[SPEAKER_09]: society, as a culture, as law,
as politics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you put it over on the other side of,
you know, it's an imaginary line,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I think it's very, very real.
[SPEAKER_09]: You put it over on the not criminal side
and doctors begin to be able to have the
[SPEAKER_09]: conversations and learn more to the point
that was made earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: People at the table with their kids,
get to be able to have conversations in a
[SPEAKER_09]: different way than they would have had
them when cannabis was over in the illegal
[SPEAKER_09]: side.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so as long as we can keep marshaling
all the different forces that want to
[SPEAKER_09]: change that categorization, I think
that'll start spreading.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll spread quicker.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a result, more people will learn
the truth about this planet and more
[SPEAKER_09]: people will consume it, which will allow
those people to let it guide you to the
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding of the bigger issues we're
talking about, of how we relate to each
[SPEAKER_09]: other as humans and how we relate to the
planet, of how we conduct all of our
[SPEAKER_09]: affairs and our intentions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's gonna gain momentum,
but we have to switch that category so
[SPEAKER_09]: that it will continue to gain those
momentums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this goes back to what Valerie
said about turning the whole industry
[SPEAKER_01]: upside down on its head and it being our
role to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we're talking about is trying
to spread an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and ideas are powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capitalism is gonna try to do to cannabis
what it does to everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chew it up, spit it out, exploit it,
maximize profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can help encourage a culture
that wants to see a different model,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is an opportunity for some
impact there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a culture of consumers who shop
responsibly, look for socially responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: models, support those industries,
support those businesses, you're gonna see
[SPEAKER_01]: an impact on those who aren't coming into
cannabis with that sort of mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can encourage also, yeah,
we all have to pay our bills, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of other different
localized models you can use, community
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens, community compassion programs
that really work on local levels as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to trying to start companies who
are dealing with a whole state or a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: province or area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different models that we can set
up that can help do that and take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: the critical need as well as be successful
in our businesses at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not every day you get to be at the
start of what's going to be such a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: economic force in industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't around when automobiles were
invented, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed the Silicon Valley tech bubble,
although that's still kind of going.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the beginning of something that I
think with a cultural awareness and an
[SPEAKER_01]: expectation of responsibility from the
beginning, we can help influence that a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does seem kind of a pie in the sky
dream thing, but cultural expectations do
[SPEAKER_01]: shift and change the wheels, although it's
slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in civil rights issues,
we see it in other issues in our
[SPEAKER_01]: communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can expect a level of giving back some
of that pie out of companies in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: really impacts our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the reality is where it's
different with cannabis is everyone should
[SPEAKER_01]: be motivated to do this because we are all
going to be patients one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're a patient now but your need
is light, our time is short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's gonna get us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis helps such a wide variety of
conditions that there's a good chance
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all gonna need this someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we can set up a structure that
when you have, heaven forbid, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosed with a type of glioblastoma or
cancer later in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as opposed to becoming medically
bankrupt, like Valerie was speaking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: having an infrastructure that is
immediately set up to then care for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you funded your whole life by
shopping responsibly, supporting those
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you have the diagnosis that
qualifies for the community to come and
[SPEAKER_01]: care for you, you're cared for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to worry about where
you're gonna get 1,500 milligrams a day of
[SPEAKER_01]: both THC and CBD to give your system a
shopping odd dose to hopefully fight some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these diseases that cannabis can be
effective on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of it's just about having
these type of conversations and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: that out there and making that an
expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our industry is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna shift some of our values into
it from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts at the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the consumer thinks it's important,
the businesses will follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speechless, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very well said, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like Kirk's opinion as well about
just, we said a similar thing years ago in
[SPEAKER_06]: 94, my partner and I, Martin, and we were
trying to get hemp grown in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just, we were having to visit
ministers and do all these things that we
[SPEAKER_06]: might as well have been on an alien
spaceship.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we would have for sure been more
at home and more comfortable on an alien
[SPEAKER_06]: spaceship than we were in some of those
situations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we got the first five acres
growing, Martin said to me, he said,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, this is gonna change the way
people think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was kinda like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pretty young.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, well, just seeing this,
just this existing is going to push
[SPEAKER_06]: against belief systems and foundations
that I'm telling you, it's gonna rock
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to rock people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And slowly but surely, it was literally a
couple of years later, Hillary was doing
[SPEAKER_06]: the Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of years later, you knew her
name, Hillary, from the body shop,
[SPEAKER_06]: had the big full-size pot leaves in the
malls.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sort of like, it affected the way
people thinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was on still the other side of
that illusionary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slowly we were pushing it over,
but now with sort of decrim or
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization 1.0, whatever you wanna call
it, at least here in Canada, it will
[SPEAKER_06]: change the way people think in a drastic
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like never to go back the way it was way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already seen tons of people that were
quite against cannabis for no other reason
[SPEAKER_06]: other than the fact that it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a huge portion of the population
that are absolutely, that's as simple as
[SPEAKER_06]: it is for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's in the newspaper and they tell you
it's good, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's in the newspaper and they tell you
it's bad, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when you realize that there's a
huge amount of people, maybe like the
[SPEAKER_06]: majority of our populace, that's how they
think and that's how they learn,
[SPEAKER_06]: then it's important to put what we're
talking about onto the other side of the
[SPEAKER_06]: imaginary line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for sure the same people from this
side are gonna try and control it and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're gonna try to maintain and contain
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Kelly was saying earlier,
it cannot be contained.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't stop it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I throw in two things that are sort of
odd?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is to do with the capitalism
thing we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goldman Sachs, to name a high temple of
capitalism, does really good research on
[SPEAKER_00]: things to guide investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw a thing recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking at cannabis companies as
investment opportunities and were
[SPEAKER_00]: cautioning the folks who might use their
guidance that the problem with cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is it actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like pharmaceuticals where you
have to get it renewed every day and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets really insanely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, people can grow their own and
it's like a problem for big money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worth looking for if that's an interesting
topic to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I wanted to throw in
sort of an odd bit, talking to a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows researchers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers at the University of
California down in Davis, which is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ag universities here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working with dairy cows and
they're under hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving cannabis to cows to see
what it does to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the report is, and this is not
published data yet, but it's just word of
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are they seeing increased milk
production but even more significantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they saw an unexpected side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cows are producing less methane,
which is a greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's because the cow's
digestive system is working better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having better gut health and so
using their food better and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: producing less methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that over the next couple of
years, the whole hemp conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly as it relates to agriculture,
is gonna help normalize just like Marcus
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first five acres started changing the
conversation in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same thing is happening in
California despite the regulation mindset
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really just another manifestation
of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, yeah, the plant is insanely
resilient and we are all incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And determined and it's a shame that
California's legal framework is playing
[SPEAKER_00]: out the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that any of us that are
working with people who need this plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: its various preparations as medicine,
we can't stop doing what, how do you say
[SPEAKER_00]: no to a family that's seeing benefit for
their child?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have, you have to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make it available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as for the corporate thing,
yeah, as Kirk was saying, a corporation is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a way of people associating together
to do a certain work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shame of corporate's identity at the
moment is for the most practical purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only about making money for your
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a thing that can be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is gonna help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah, it's a shame what's
happened in California and all across the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, we have to help the people who are
writing the rules that don't know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis to understand what went
wrong in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might get it closer to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it has everything to do with
an individual's right to cultivate their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as they see fit wherever they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there should be a supply chain where
cultivars be they seeds or clones are
[SPEAKER_00]: available for those individuals to grow
what they need and information available
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to make their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, pharmaceutical companies and
governments cannot own this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every person should have the right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to add something to what you're
saying, Wade, is that if we're feeding the
[SPEAKER_13]: cows hemp, then the milk that they're
producing also has traces of CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: A friend of ours did a study on feeding
his chickens 20% CBD and then tested the
[SPEAKER_13]: egg yolks.
[SPEAKER_13]: They had 3% CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a way that we can actually
start getting cannabinoids into people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also wanted to address, Hilary,
what you were saying earlier is that it is
[SPEAKER_13]: absolutely imperative for access around
the world right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I work in disaster relief areas.
[SPEAKER_13]: I work in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've worked in Haiti.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've helped hundreds of people dying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I could just have had and birthing
and women in birthing situations and
[SPEAKER_13]: horrible trauma, you know, after the
tsunami or after the earthquake that
[SPEAKER_13]: happened, and if I had had cannabis,
things would have been incredibly
[SPEAKER_13]: different.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't tell you how many times that I
wished that these countries had safe
[SPEAKER_13]: access because I know that we would be
able to deal with those issues and those
[SPEAKER_13]: traumatic situations in such a better way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, better is, you know, like what
Valerie said, you know, there's such a
[SPEAKER_13]: lack of words that I have in lieu of what
this plant provides.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't necessarily connect with
the use of the term drug either.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like the term essential nutrient
because it really is an essential nutrient
[SPEAKER_08]: in our neurological system and in the cows
to not produce methane or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does have an effect on our mind,
which, you know, it does put it into a
[SPEAKER_08]: different category.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, how you feel after you
haven't eaten in a while or different
[SPEAKER_08]: foods that connect with our system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we like to think of it as an essential
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that way, it frees it up and allows
us to feed it to our animals and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a medicine or a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where people confuse is that it's
not a narcotic, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really where that confusion comes in,
where we look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just kind of we've lost the ability
to, you know, with words and definitions
[SPEAKER_01]: these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that on Twitter and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Words don't have meanings, you know,
but, yeah, cannabis isn't a narcotic in
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that these these other drugs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the benefit that it can provide is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how think of the different world
we'd be living in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get off the big dreams topic for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we subsidize hemp like we did corn
and filled the Midwest with hemp instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of corn and use that for livestock feed
and use that for biofuels and use that for
[SPEAKER_01]: other the endless amount of industries
that hemp can be beneficial for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would see that trickle into pretty much
every aspect of our life from our food to
[SPEAKER_01]: our air to our water and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be, you know, that's a
benefit that it's it's amazing that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just not really something that is on the
radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think if I was just corporately
minded, that would be a big motivator to
[SPEAKER_01]: get involved in those that industry and
really push that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, we've seen hemp added to the
farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can start to make this shift,
I mean, in 30 years, our communities could
[SPEAKER_01]: look very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they do now, you know, in every
topic, it's a mate from global warming to
[SPEAKER_01]: our diets, to our health, to our food,
very different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where hemp looks at like this
big issue where it's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people say it's a miracle and it's not
magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some believe it's magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's but it's one of the most amazing
plants on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's introduction to every aspect of
our life can lead to nothing but benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only medicine with no lethal
dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the best side effect ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being honest and mother or lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we went to Romania, we went to a
place where they used to grow hemp,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, for the as a live as a
livelihood, and they made their clothes
[SPEAKER_08]: from it and they, you know, fed their
fodder, fed their animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after the fall of the USSR and
communism, they stopped subsidizing hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: in the in the countryside and went
towards, you know, other types of farming
[SPEAKER_08]: and poly, you know, to make the ropes and
everything that they were doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we went to those parts of Romania
that were growing hemp, now there's the
[SPEAKER_08]: government is just subsidizing them to
stack hay and grow hay and have fields of
[SPEAKER_08]: hay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's interesting to see how on earth
we've gone through so many different
[SPEAKER_08]: cycles of ways that, you know,
we've OK'd it and not OK'd it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was amazing fabrics that we saw
there that people were still wearing that
[SPEAKER_08]: had been made, you know, 50 and 60 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just it was kind of frustrating
to not see hemp growing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was interesting to see how in that
system people were able to grow it and it
[SPEAKER_08]: was subsidized by the government at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here in the United States,
the original copies that exist of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Declaration of Independence are written on
paper made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're going to see hemp have a
resurgence in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: with federal reforms in place,
both in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think that, you know,
we've had that now category switch where
[SPEAKER_09]: it's going to be of interest to large
economic drivers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, that's the other side of it
is for hemp to sort of take off and to be
[SPEAKER_09]: used for all these purposes that we know
it can be used for.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality of the world we live in is
there also has to be an economic case for
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because to grow millions of hectares of
plants and harvest them and turn them into
[SPEAKER_09]: things requires fairly significant
infrastructure and the whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_09]: money and a whole bunch of people and
equipment and all of those things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that economic case has to exist or
the capital won't flow to the activity and
[SPEAKER_09]: it won't occur.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it does exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're going to see more and
more of it start happening now that some
[SPEAKER_09]: of the restrictions that our laws have put
in the place are falling away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, after 23 years of growing hemp in
Canada and hemp oil and hemp hearts,
[SPEAKER_06]: being really like 95 percent, maybe more,
I was just in one of the largest hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: processing facilities in Manitoba recently
when I was there for a hemp conference and
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting with farmers, all the farmers,
their value is the essential amino acid
[SPEAKER_06]: rich seed oil and the hemp hearts and the
protein powder isolates that come from the
[SPEAKER_06]: seed cakes after they've been cold
pressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just you don't see, you know,
when we approached our minister,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was really about these 50,000
commercial products, all these amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: products that you could make from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really quickly learned as well that
it was it was the and I believe it's
[SPEAKER_06]: passed hundreds of millions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's in the billions of dollars
of infrastructure that are required for
[SPEAKER_06]: these things to exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was kind of utopian of us to think
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just kept it illegal for so long and
allowed all these other technologies to
[SPEAKER_06]: take the place to deal with the plants
that they were processing, whether it be
[SPEAKER_06]: cotton or flax or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so hemp just was so far behind that
it's managed to I could really see the CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: thing, the cannabinoid thing being able to
grow monomolecular medicines, maybe not
[SPEAKER_06]: the highest quality full plant spectrum,
but for producing monomolecular medicines
[SPEAKER_06]: like CBD and THC that you wouldn't be able
to grow at any cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would allow potentially for
farmers to make the kind of money and
[SPEAKER_06]: producers and processors to make the kind
of money that they could then turn around
[SPEAKER_06]: and put their money where their mouth is
and say, yeah, we want to start a plastics
[SPEAKER_06]: program with the hemp seed husks from the
seed and some of the fiber and cellulose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we want to start a paper project or
doing things that would require this
[SPEAKER_06]: infrastructure on a very it's it's big
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just to tie a bow on all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this conversation shows me is is
that there is really no limit to social
[SPEAKER_01]: good opportunities if you want to work
with with cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, we focus on I focus on
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people here are patient
focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ability, as far as I'm concerned,
having a cannabis entity or organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: take your pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no shortage of things that you can
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if and if you're choosing not to,
you know, hey, that's everybody's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's in the spirit of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our community and our culture,
when there's so much in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant and business with this plant
has the opportunity to affect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from plastics to regenerative
agriculture to, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate a need for other dangerous
industries, patient care, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really take your pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have that thought in the front of
your mind is so while I do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: what am I looking to impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: What benefit do I want to bring to the
community more than just financial gain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's something that if
we can put as part of the culture and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversations, you know, come out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look who's here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's really interesting,
too, is that, you know, talking about
[SPEAKER_13]: large ag, we're talking about corn
industry or the soybean industry and,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, tobacco or, you know,
even the forest industry and how it's
[SPEAKER_13]: taken over, you know, this plant is an
adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a master plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has the ability to think past that a
lot of these plants are not master plants
[SPEAKER_13]: in the same way they can be controlled.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've seen it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to think that the people that
are supporting this plant are also
[SPEAKER_13]: adaptogenic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that we have vast amounts of
ability to move forward in this industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're seeing a resurgence in hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're seeing a resurgence in cannabis
because that's the nature of an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what adaptogens do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I see that also within this community
we are an adaptogenic community and we're
[SPEAKER_13]: not going away.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that, you know, to tie a bow
on it as well in this conversation is that
[SPEAKER_13]: all of these people here on this panel are
incredible adaptogens.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're all moving forward to make a
change in this industry, but also to make
[SPEAKER_13]: a change in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just have faith that the plant is
going to continue to show her face over
[SPEAKER_13]: and over again all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_13]: And whatever we can do to help guide her
and help aid her in that path is what we
[SPEAKER_13]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I had a conversation many years
ago with Ram Dass and he was sitting
[SPEAKER_13]: backstage somewhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all by himself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had two doobies in my pocket and I
was like, oh, this is an incredible
[SPEAKER_13]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, three hours later after the
conversation, what I really picked up out
[SPEAKER_13]: of that conversation is that he made the
differentiation between the pointer and
[SPEAKER_13]: the moon.
[SPEAKER_13]: All of us are pointers and the moon is the
plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how is it that we can continue to point
at the moon so that she can move forward
[SPEAKER_13]: in an adaptogenic way to change the world?
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for sharing, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And welcome, Skunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the new angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see he's on the sort of couch now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I there?
[SPEAKER_06]: You are there or here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you the moon or are you the pointer?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're definitely the pointer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little bit late because I was out
having dinner with my daughter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't want to keep you from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've just been having a great
conversation about all things cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Valerie Corrales in the room and
Hilary Black and Forrest and Wade and the
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Kirk Toussaint.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you'll stir shit up for us,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'll just say howdy, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't you look beautiful?
[SPEAKER_06]: Decked out for the... He's always got the
sparkly boa on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it always comes into to play during
this season, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a boa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's always a season for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You look so dashing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only one time did Sam accidentally show
part of his chin on Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of stepped into the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still living that down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I thought we got a little arm
there a second ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had arms.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does arm, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does not do face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only for the lucky few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Valerie, you just got greetings from my
wife, Diana.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sends her love.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's muted if she's talking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Muted it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, backwards.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just so taken by your beauty.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say much love and big hug
back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great to see you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great to connect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash Church, it's where we connect.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's hundreds of people and they're
watching and listening to what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're also having their own
conversation over on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say, aside from the odd
troll, good group of people in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, you can kind of read the real time
inspiration that's occurring after things
[SPEAKER_06]: are said.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's great that our conversation,
of course, the purpose of this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation is to continue other
conversations and to create action.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's neat to be able to just see
some of the, you know, maybe 100 or 200 of
[SPEAKER_06]: the five or 600 that are watching at any
given time are just having this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that spark in real time
being ignited.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously there's a bunch of it that
we can't see, but it definitely feels like
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the good work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always, you know, this channel,
I've always said it, it's kind of the
[SPEAKER_06]: metaphor of the corporate greed versus the
grassroots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for me, once again, always sort of
seeing that group of pioneers that have
[SPEAKER_06]: really brought this for what I consider
the truest, most righteous reasons has
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed me to do that with the channel and
not just make the channel about me and try
[SPEAKER_06]: to promote my products and make sales,
but be like, how can I make this channel
[SPEAKER_06]: like better?
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the last month, this channel has
gotten over a million and a 1.1 million
[SPEAKER_06]: views in the last 28 days on this channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, yeah, that's a lot of views.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcus, you get a dollar for every viewer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually, they actually paid me $970
for last month's episode, but I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_06]: donate it to, to Ram and to the Caladrius
network.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea you were getting money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've monetized my channel for,
listen, I used to work for a YouTube
[SPEAKER_06]: monetization company and I went to Jamaica
and my thing was to explain to my Jamaican
[SPEAKER_06]: artist friends that have many who have
been ripped off by producers and this,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, and the other thing, uh,
offer them a way to create revenue when
[SPEAKER_06]: people are listening to their music.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I turned a bunch of them onto it,
including Toots from Toots in the Maytall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I signed a bunch of these different bands
and it was a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, listen, people are already
listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube is where young people go to listen
to music.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after learning and teaching them about
why wouldn't you monetize your channel to
[SPEAKER_06]: do whatever, whether, uh, soldiers of Ja
Army, they didn't want to monetize their
[SPEAKER_06]: channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, listen, monetize it and donate the
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are losing hundreds of thousands
of dollars over the many, many tens and
[SPEAKER_06]: twenties and 30 million views your videos
get and also convince them to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, uh, it taught me in a sense that
it would make no sense not to monetize my
[SPEAKER_06]: channel, but at the same time do good
things with that monetization.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it gives people that support the
message of the artist or the content
[SPEAKER_09]: creator, a way to thank them and support
them for creating the content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, my kids sort of do a lot of YouTube
watch in and Twitch watching as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've sort of looked into this,
this, this, the, the sort of phenomenon of
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of self directed economic activity
where there's only a small intermediary
[SPEAKER_09]: between the artist or the content creator,
uh, and the ultimate consumer that wants
[SPEAKER_09]: to help them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, it's pretty fascinating because
there's a, you know, you, all these things
[SPEAKER_09]: are available free, but you can also
choose to economically support those
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and lots of people make that choice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's, that's kind of wonderful
to have that ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, I haven't shared this,
but you know, I don't think people realize
[SPEAKER_01]: how big of an impact can be had,
you know, with very little, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: monetary donation, which is, which is why,
you know, we'll get back to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody going to the, everybody go into
these other festivals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, please start to ask the people that
you're speaking with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are they doing in their community?
[SPEAKER_01]: What social good programs are they getting
involved with?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the collateral network has
been running above ground, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a little over two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and in that time, because we're being
shut down in a few weeks, uh, we're in,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're getting everything we can out to
families to help tide them over until we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get the laws changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looking at our books, you know,
we have donated in the last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we're at about $956,000
worth of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think my goal by the, by January
9th, when the collective model ends in
[SPEAKER_01]: California is we're going to top over a
million dollars worth of donations to
[SPEAKER_01]: families.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is with monetary donations to the
collateral network for the last two years
[SPEAKER_01]: being under $12,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with less than 12 grand and some
community volunteers and an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community, um, we've been able to
donate over a million or we will,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to donate over a million
dollars, uh, by January 9th worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: medication to, to families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I just, I share that and
I haven't shared this in the past cause it
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, it sounds a little ego centric,
but, but a lot of people wonder like,
[SPEAKER_01]: does this do any good?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the people putting little
donations up here in hash church or
[SPEAKER_01]: donating the Wham or these others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the amount of benefit that comes out
of every nickel that is donated,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to some of these nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to know that everything
that people have done to support us over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last two years has paid off
significantly, uh, for the people that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were, were hoping to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to see that, that,
uh, that attitude continue to move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in every state in the United States
and in Canada, because these programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Hillary's and others that are,
that are instituting social good programs
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, um, they need the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do support them, um,
it pays off and we were really shocked to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the numbers that we had once we
finally went into the books and looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: None of us can do it without you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, Kirk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: None of us can do it without all of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's not, we don't do this
alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: It never has been alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So even in, even with the opportunity to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on just a little bit of noise in my,
my help and given the opportunity to serve
[SPEAKER_12]: one another and being able to,
you know, and I appreciate your kindness
[SPEAKER_12]: toward me, but it's never been done alone.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always been a massive movement with
all of us holding our place and holding
[SPEAKER_12]: the line.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, and because the cannabis awareness is
a movement already and plant healing and
[SPEAKER_12]: the sacred plants healing us, allowing us
the opportunity to use them for our own
[SPEAKER_12]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think as well for their benefit,
uh, it makes a huge front.
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes a profound impact.
[SPEAKER_12]: Being able to serve people at their
greatest time of need is a massive reward.
[SPEAKER_12]: So whatever money and I know that that you
agree with this for us, um, at TN,
[SPEAKER_12]: he's not here right now, but all of us
who, every one of us here who shares,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's such a rich reward, powerful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And while we do need to pay rent and,
um, I know, I know it differently now,
[SPEAKER_12]: since I don't have my land anymore,
that the, the really profound impact is
[SPEAKER_12]: something that lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And touches everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we really have a great job and we do it
together.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm super proud to be with allies,
with you allies and, uh, super gratified,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, it's rich and yummy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a beautiful thing to talk
about, you know, after everything we've
[SPEAKER_08]: gone through and to find the rich and
yummy section and go there is what feels
[SPEAKER_08]: good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a big part of our, our farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Network is to have social, um,
social work that you do and things that
[SPEAKER_08]: you give to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've, we've our farm network.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's a big part of what we do is to
have them donate to different groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, you know, we've, we see that as
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a way that we can give back to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, and I, and I want to put it out to,
you know, if, if Forrest and Wade are not
[SPEAKER_13]: going to that until January 4th,
our first, uh, Caladrius network can
[SPEAKER_13]: accept donations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anybody who has CBD or has the ability
to give away, um, you know, any extra
[SPEAKER_13]: flower or medicine to the Caladrius
network, please do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's absolutely imperative that they can
continue their work in helping children.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a call out to all farmers in
California and all CBD farmers throughout
[SPEAKER_13]: the U S, uh, Caladrius can take donations
and they need your donations and support
[SPEAKER_08]: lamb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've, I've slowed down on asking for
things because we're not really sure what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, and she's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are taking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just slowed down publicly asking
because one, I never want to accept a
[SPEAKER_01]: nickel or a dollar or a donation that
isn't going to go where I say it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just in this period right now where
once again, we're being forced into the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market and in how, so we're looking
at, we can in our accepting donations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I appreciate that very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in equal to that, we just need people
continued support to keep alive in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation that some of the patients
that are cannabis laws were built on the
[SPEAKER_01]: backs of have now cast them aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, we just need to see
that, that change and everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: donated to us, uh, up until the deadline
is going to be immediately given out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what our goal, what we've been trying
to do, uh, on top of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of my own son and his needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is, is get, you know, a year to 18 months
worth of medicine out to every single
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get it donated prior to
the deadline and then give us this
[SPEAKER_01]: cushion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not, again, that doesn't solve
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't help the families we've had
to not take on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to close our enrollment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that, you know, it's very difficult
to tell a family, no, or which I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: yet the ones in hospice, but the,
you know, if they're coming, the families
[SPEAKER_01]: who are coming saying, you know,
our daughters in hospice, we heard about
[SPEAKER_01]: your organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctors say that might be the only
thing that can save her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not expected to live throughout the
week and have to say, well, we're being
[SPEAKER_01]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I cannot stress enough how
important it is for the community's help
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Senator Wiener in California is going
to be reentered announced that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroducing the compassion legislation
that I and others have been working on,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for two or three years now that was
vetoed by the government or by governor
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Brown that put us in this bad
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need support as that gets
closer to coming to fruition again,
[SPEAKER_01]: this legislative season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I just want to keep,
keep the hope alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Donations, support, spreading the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, anything you guys can do
there will literally translate into saving
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, adults in cases like wham and weed for
warriors, uh, children in cases you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the collateral set work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a, it's not a feel good
exaggeration talking point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we're going to save lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for some of us, we see it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very literal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tangible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the eyes of the parents and the
mother, you see the death, you get
[SPEAKER_01]: invitations to the funerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's real and it's just heartbreaking
that it's, um, it's on the back burner,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with with the help of, of,
you know, communities like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we can make a real impact.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bravo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to get too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, it really is,
um, it's been quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the truth of it is, is the reason
why people like Marcus and I have been
[SPEAKER_02]: helping so much is for people like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the benefit that I've gotten is I
want cannabis to be legalized for people
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, you're definitely a big
part of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's so moving is what do you think?
[SPEAKER_12]: When you think of being silenced,
being shut down, of all the people that
[SPEAKER_12]: you can't reach, it feels, uh,
it's, it's disempowering and it feels
[SPEAKER_12]: hopeless.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that you don't leave that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that there is a way to,
for us collectively together to serve and
[SPEAKER_12]: to find an answer to this, to this
particular problem that's profound.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's right at the very top of the
list.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause if tomorrow or January 1st,
people are not served, if lives are not
[SPEAKER_12]: saved because of restrictions that are
just unjust and absolutely they're
[SPEAKER_12]: meaningless.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, there's risk involved,
but there's always risk involved in doing
[SPEAKER_12]: what's, what's good and what's right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that is not at the, it is not the
driven by profit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like imagine that you had so much good,
you couldn't even count it or spend it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you did it every moment of every single
day for the rest of your life and every
[SPEAKER_12]: other lifetime you possibly could get.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so that's the goal and that's the work
and trust that you are, um, in,
[SPEAKER_12]: you have comrades and that, that will
help.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that the issue, the point that I'm
trying to, that we are trying to do with
[SPEAKER_12]: WAM is to expand it to become ever more
inclusive because always we've been for 25
[SPEAKER_12]: years, our work has been done through
attrition.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, come in, who's the sickest?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you weigh those things?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like who's suffering?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you weigh suffering and access?
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, we just trust that we'll find a
way to do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you and I will just talk privately
about what is profoundly important to
[SPEAKER_12]: human human life and diminishing suffering
and the life of the very planet that we
[SPEAKER_12]: are consuming for, for our own benefit and
how we create balance in, in that exercise
[SPEAKER_12]: of kindness.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to, to seeing what,
how we're all going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, cause you know that, you know,
there's no stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just, there's, there's no choice
to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a, it wasn't a choice for me to
get involved in this, although I'm glad in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of ways that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was illness that brought me
here like so many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that's not going away because the
law has changed and I'll be damned if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to let my son, uh, go without
because of the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm working to help my son,
then how could I not help others that
[SPEAKER_01]: come?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of how the collateral network
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some community gardens,
a couple of parents saw reports in the
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper and other things and said,
Hey, could you help us and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you, how do you not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I'm excited to see kind of how,
how it moves forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but at the same time, you know,
the risk is that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're back where we were years ago,
where we set up gardens, we get them going
[SPEAKER_01]: for children or patients and they're just
cut down or here in, uh, Sierra County
[SPEAKER_01]: right next door to us, they're not even
putting up gate notices anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, they literally bring the
bulldozer on the back of a truck and just
[SPEAKER_01]: bulldoze over the gate, over the garden,
drive the bulldozer back up on the truck
[SPEAKER_01]: and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if, you know, if that's
legalization, then we've got a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no respect, whether it's a legal,
you know, medical garden, uh, no worrying
[SPEAKER_01]: about, uh, you know, what has been,
you know, if there's scripts or
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations of some of those that are
still compliant in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: just bulldozing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, it's that uncertainty
that is, that is, uh, terrifying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you're dealing with,
with life or death treatments,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't, we shouldn't have to
worry about being bulldozed, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to save our child's life or our mother's
life or our father's life or our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this should be something that sort of,
uh, ability should be rooted into the very
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, not to beat a dead horse,
pardon the horrible expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, this is why I think it's,
it's just gotta be in our daily
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and it's, and it's not as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's people watching
this show and there's people on the show
[SPEAKER_01]: who get interviewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we get interviewed for local
media, for, for papers, we do panels and
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of us are going to be at the
Emerald Cup here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to just encourage and
request that, that, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: where, where you're able to insert some of
these realities into those conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because that's, you know, it's ideas
that are going to change our landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, what I found is, is as people
know and are educated, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of people are essentially
good and they want to see it change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, really the more that we
can encourage that and encourage sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: these topics to be brought up and inserted
into other conversations for those of us
[SPEAKER_01]: who have a platform, um, I would
definitely appreciate it greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it would have a real
impact.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got you covered on that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on panels.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your, your network is on our website and,
uh, we'll put Valerie's on there too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And any chance we get to be a voice for
anyone doing good, we totally agree with
[SPEAKER_08]: you that it's, it's almost our duty if we
have a platform to make use of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I encourage everybody else out there
who's listening, who do have a large
[SPEAKER_13]: platform that this is a very important,
potent conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to say potent because I think that
that's fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that it's important,
but it really is truly important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, no matter where you are,
no matter where you are, I think,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's as simple as this forest that
you just don't stop doing anything and
[SPEAKER_06]: that you, you know, you bring it to the
media's attention when things are done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how can you arrest people that are
helping like very ill children?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just, it's that there's no,
there's no leg to stand on in that
[SPEAKER_06]: argument.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it would be, uh, you would change the
laws in the first case that went through,
[SPEAKER_06]: like nobody, nobody is that ignorant to
not see the suffering that I see right now
[SPEAKER_06]: on your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not acting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's the real deal, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say it's not that the
arrest because nobody in their right mind
[SPEAKER_12]: would do that, but it's, it's the,
it eliminates the ability to practice,
[SPEAKER_12]: to go into business.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you violate the tenants of the law and
then you're, you're eliminated from,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, continuing in that process.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why we have to, uh, create the
umbrella that, uh, and the cradle really
[SPEAKER_12]: the cradle that holds all of us safely to
do our work because really it's about
[SPEAKER_12]: outcome and, and the only way to achieve
the outcome that we are seeking is to hold
[SPEAKER_12]: one another in that grace that we hold one
another in, that we recognize that we are
[SPEAKER_12]: equal and that we, we function with
equanimity and balance.
[SPEAKER_12]: And how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_12]: By, by supporting one another.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause there is no one better to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Any of this work than all of us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a seven, was it a seven year
ban?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're caught working outside the
regulated market, um, which is it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's an incentive for a
reason and it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it does, it does, it makes a real
question as to how to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's, we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another, another show.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's every show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Mahatma Gandhi who talked about
fighting unjust law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, one of the things that I am
certain is going to happen is that people
[SPEAKER_00]: will continue to resist this version of an
unjust law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this, again, this plant has no lethal
dose and it has such amazing properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the proper preparations,
not just for those in desperate need,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the general health of all beings
and for the health of our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, uh, I think each of us are
part of a group of people who are standing
[SPEAKER_00]: up to this new version of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and I know in my work supporting
forest, I, uh, you can't say no to these
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, thank you to each of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's, uh, hash church has been a,
uh, uh, I feel the spirit of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very present in all of us here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, thank you for bringing us
together and thank you to each of you for
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing who you are with me and all of us
who are listening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wade laughter.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should conclude with your name and,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, but still there's always social
justice work to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't change yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: 10,000 years more.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will evolve confident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I look forward to seeing all you
who, who were going at the Emerald cup a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get out much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, all of you listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those of you here, it'll be great
to see a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see forest and Wade running around
together quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys much, much love, deep love and
admiration and respect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it means a lot coming from you
about, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a privilege talking to you all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you everyone for coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've rocked a solid three hours on this
Sunday morning now afternoon, although I
[SPEAKER_06]: think Hillary, you've probably been in
afternoon for most of hash church.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you, Hillary, for coming and
sharing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Such a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been on the road for a long time
and it can be a little lonely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got to like hang out with family and
friends today.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel very connected, re-inspired,
filled up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for us as always, uh, powerful
stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gets you thinking, gets you, gets you
thinking a little bit differently from,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, from maybe the regular way of thinking
in this community where we can get caught
[SPEAKER_06]: up in some of the, well, we can just get
hypnotized like in any community,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, with, you know, these different
things of less importance when we could,
[SPEAKER_06]: when we should be sharing a little bit of
our time on things that are a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do appreciate cannabis has depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all, you know, you can focus on a
lot of aspects of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just the area we're focused on is,
is intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not always fun to talk about when
you're enjoying the fun parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, but it's because of that,
it gets, it gets forgotten sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's good to bring up and
keep on our focus that this plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and how we can be involved with it is
so diverse that, um, you could spend your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life working in cannabis and,
and this happens quite a bit and not hit
[SPEAKER_01]: all the different aspects of how it's
interacting with people's lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really appreciate you giving us an
opportunity to, to speak about where our
[SPEAKER_01]: focus is and how it can be integrated into
all the different areas that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it very much.
Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would like to give thanks for the
opportunity to have a connection to a
[SPEAKER_08]: plant and having a sacred plant medicine
to be able to connect with and having
[SPEAKER_08]: that, that love for herbalism and that
connection to, to the earth is,
[SPEAKER_08]: is really, really important to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even when it comes to, um,
you know, birth and midwifery and just
[SPEAKER_08]: being a, you know, a natural person on
earth, you know, it takes a lot of kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: guts almost sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, and having, seeing everyone here
today really gives us infinite
[SPEAKER_08]: inspiration.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I just like to personally give you
a big virtual hug right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, really, really tell you just from
the bottom of our heart, we truly
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really we, we would do anything for
all of you and, and anyone else.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, that's the inspiration that'll
keep us moving forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the type of inspiration that's
going to change laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do have no choice, but to continue
our work, whether the law supports it or
[SPEAKER_08]: not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a reality and that will be,
um, something that we'll figure out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll do it together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks dragon fly earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Wade and Kirk, I know you had to leave
and then you came back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're glad you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a skunk man, Sam, you came in late,
but we're happy that you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good to hear your voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah, I think, um, probably going
to rock another one of these next Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, thank you all so much,
