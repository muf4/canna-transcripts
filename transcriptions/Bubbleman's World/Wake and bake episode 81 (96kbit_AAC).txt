[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here like come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the wake and bake episode What
is it 81 is it episode 81?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we somehow have we somehow wake and
baked 81 times together in the last?
[SPEAKER_00]: 81 or so days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've been missing Sundays,
but we don't really miss Sundays because
[SPEAKER_00]: let's be honest Sundays are all about one
thing hash church and last week two days
[SPEAKER_00]: ago or one day ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was only yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a powerful church for those of
you that didn't watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely suggest going and
checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Peter from soil balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Brian from vital garden supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Wade from the house of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had forest from the Caladrius network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course all the old regulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Mark Sheldone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mark was in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Etienne made it back after his computer
died skunk man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam was in the house to share his
knowledge with us as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my favorite panels in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to see it full almost all the
way right up to the end of church that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows that there was some mixing up that
was necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little bit of stirring of the
pot that was necessary because it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: while since we've actually had a full
panel like that and I'll tell you it felt
[SPEAKER_00]: good in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm puffing on some heavenly days resins
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got three different flavors from the
green crack sweet skunk and Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it was great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well Johnny B wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny B was doing his thing but you know
what it's nice to see some D420K wasn't in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house either and as much as I love
Johnny B and D420K it was nice to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some new people in the room as well and
that's you know it's a hard thing when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started Hash Church all my
friends after inviting them three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: times in a row kind of became quite
comfortable with the fact that they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: spot on Hash Church and that they would
always be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday D420K was too busy and Johnny
B was too busy and it opened up the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for us to invite some other
people into the room and some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: other people were sharing a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's kind of the hard difficult
choice to invite new people tell your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends they have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get them back in next week obviously
or the week after.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not like a trading in the
good folks but it's hard to give other
[SPEAKER_00]: people opportunities if you don't you know
ask your other friends or have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity come up that your friends
aren't able to make it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John and D are awesome in the sense
that anytime someone wants to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: the room they're willing to move out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always appreciated them for that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit of a hard decision
you know sometimes when I don't invite
[SPEAKER_00]: someone they'll text me the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey are you mad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you mad at me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'll text me during church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey why did I not get a link?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like well Hash Church is it's
ever-changing experience and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see it change more and
more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah when Tony showed those mites I'm
telling you I felt like I was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled over by the police my heart started
beating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know StinkBob.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we all get impressed by different
things and so I don't know you as a person
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know you as a smoker and it would
be hard for me to answer you why you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not excited about DC Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said I'm pretty excited about
about the goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Matt Butler you did not miss the
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won the giveaway in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to send you a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah they are large small large and
small she sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what size are you Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: What size are you Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: What size are you Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what size you are small medium or
large and I will send you out a shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an extra large I'll have to show
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to look to see if I actually
have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah if you could reply what size you are
Matt that would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namaste is not Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting large.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to say that it's episode 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that you won the Karma Cup
shirt and then I want to see your address
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can just copy and paste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it the easiest for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a few people who said they
didn't get their materials that I sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have it get lost in the mail
than not send it and be a sketch bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please make sure you send me that
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day when I gave away the two
pins only Aaron sent me the email for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember who won the other pin but
they never sent me an email so obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: in a couple of weeks when they text me and
say hey I never got my pin I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: like well you never sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never sent me your address and stuff
so it's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard for me to send that shit out without
an address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not impossible I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably track it down but I think
it's time for a wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before grinding up the herb before making
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do it you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that is going to be about you
trying to get the most out of it which is
[SPEAKER_00]: very much so why you would want to grind
the herb up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's really going to make it so
you focus on getting the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's counterintuitive and it's tricking
you and it's going to fuck up your quality
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well not so much your quality but your
purity which will fuck up your quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break up the herb too small and you
don't have surface area for the herb to
[SPEAKER_00]: float no survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't shred the heads surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that I've seen that shreds
the heads is microplaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I mean if you're planning on running
it into rosin anyway then it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: you just have schwag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if you are grinding your bud and
then running it into hash that hash is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously no good because you want to make
it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't get me wrong rosin isn't like
this horrible thing and happy 710 to all
[SPEAKER_00]: of you out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have my rosin dab here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I prefer hash all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's 710 we're going to smoke some oil
but hash doesn't hold oil doesn't hold a
[SPEAKER_00]: candle to hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I hear people that are like I'm
just going to you know make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell that the hash they're making is
not five or six star but it's more along
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines of a two or a three star maybe a
four star.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're getting into that high of
a level of a quality who the hell wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: press it in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me that's who.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's have a melty day and
indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's the holy grail dude I can't get
enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all just that's all I can say about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so let's get a little a little
congo lease on the 710 for our 710 rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah let's blaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you we haven't even had
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really gets the conversation going like
having a little rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say no to growing swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say no to just growing swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know some people do make it out of
five and six star although it's funny
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you actually get to their
house and you see their five or six star
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like I think that might have been a
four star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're a little bit more picky when
it comes to saying what a five or a six
[SPEAKER_00]: star is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly because we're grading not to
sell but just to tell people the melt
[SPEAKER_00]: factor of the actual hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got pining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to actually see a folk turpin
profile down on it because there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: definite magic going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to get rid of this mild mild
chas that's on my bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the genetics of swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ask anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all smoking it and I don't
actually mean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the truth really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are smoking show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish people were smoking better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish people took it more seriously and
really tried to acquire the quality that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seeking rather than just give up
and decide you know what this super swaggy
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage weed is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough for me and I'm just going to
blast it into some some shitty oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll be that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No that's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not the high road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if you watched church last week it
was or yesterday I keep saying that like
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the episode the whole
conversation about quality the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know on one side you got Mark Sheldon
talking about how people could potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it up using different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have like conscious
individuals like skunk man Sam saying no
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want to let people know that they
can clean up anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want people to grow utter and
complete shit full of powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: and full of bugs and you know all these
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want like Wade was saying like to grow
resilient cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know people like Sam I would say that
it would balance it well for your
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter uses that product on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I haven't used soil balance pro but I
like what Peter has to say and I like his
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and I feel that he's a pretty
honest fellow from the conversation that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very much looking forward to trying
his product on on the roots of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh what do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that gave it ever back for
the fire to make it legal again stating
[SPEAKER_00]: that it'll never be safe for consumption?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Daniel Cruz that's you know a bit of
a tricky situation because keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seems to be the only industry
where people have a consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever because if you look at any
other industry even the food industry the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of foods that are sprayed with
deadly chemicals and GMO'd with deadly
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals are not safe for human
consumption but somehow through that
[SPEAKER_00]: system they have managed to pay the bribes
to get it so it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in reality many many many things are
not fit for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis just seems to bring to the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about it how some people
will you know they it's the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to clean their oil and make it as
clean as possible and they will spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: day or a week or a month trolling someone
on Instagram because they have dirty poop
[SPEAKER_00]: soup butane oil but in the meantime they
will eat fast food they will be 150 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: overweight they will have no personal
hygiene and these are the things that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like are the dichotomies most of the
things in life don't teach us about
[SPEAKER_00]: raising our bar about like becoming more
conscious but cannabis does and I'm quite
[SPEAKER_00]: certain that it's because of the
relationship we have with smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would teach us that same
thing if if it were not being ingested
[SPEAKER_00]: into our bodies the way it is so you have
this amazing plant that can feed us and
[SPEAKER_00]: clothe us and get us medicated and it
teaches us consciousness it teaches us to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more conscious whether you're eating a
meat-eating diet or a vegetarian diet
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps you want to eat non-tortured flesh
perhaps you want to eat you know non-GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables you know there's levels to this
shit and you learn about it in cannabis by
[SPEAKER_00]: starting as a kid smoking seeds and stocks
and thick paper and glue and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of the seeds in the stock and
eventually getting thinner paper and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually getting no glue and eventually
starting to take the bud away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper and put it in a pipe and then
eventually taking the bud and breaking it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and collecting the resin and eventually
taking the resin and separating it out
[SPEAKER_00]: from the non-resin to the resin and then
eventually taking the resin and separating
[SPEAKER_00]: that out into micron diameter increments
and that's how far we have come in this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful thing of you know the cannabis
industry hey let's get silo I hope it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not too crazy we've got a lot of people in
here there's 234 people and what I find
[SPEAKER_00]: about the group of people that like to
come in here is that I try to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable for you to ask questions no
matter what they are you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be ridiculed you're not going to be
laughed at we might make jokes and laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: with you but we're not going to laugh at
you so whatever I like the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone who's watching really being a
part of it and really asking their
[SPEAKER_00]: questions sometimes you might have to ask
your question a couple of times because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is going fast and if you notice I'm
talking while reading as well as thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the next thing that I'm going to say
I agree well water really good people in
[SPEAKER_00]: here I saw that you came into hash church
late yesterday I hope you did get a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to rewatch it you came in quite late if
I'm correct I remember seeing something
[SPEAKER_00]: about you at around the three hour mark oh
Matt my email address is BC bubble man at
[SPEAKER_00]: iCloud dot com the history of the 710 I
don't know it kind of happened with the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil community it certainly didn't exist 20
plus years ago but maybe 10 or 15 I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even remember now as you get older you
sort of lose track of years and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: remember like what oh that was just a year
ago it's like no it was like seven years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago oh shit crazy ah there nice to hear
Cuban chronic nice to hear Cuban chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow got blocked out of our chat for a
while so welcome back to him you did miss
[SPEAKER_00]: the giveaway someone got a t-shirt a karma
cup t-shirt in fact cool t-shirt right
[SPEAKER_00]: there in fact I should pull it out right
now he said a large and there is his
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirt oh I didn't even see the front
that's pretty nice hey nice t-shirt that
[SPEAKER_00]: good that good let's thank Sarah Sunday
for that you know Sarah I've said it
[SPEAKER_00]: before and I'll say it again she's an
extremely capable person so you know for
[SPEAKER_00]: me my whole worry is when I go to an event
that my money that I spend is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made worthwhile that the person putting on
the event is going to make a point on
[SPEAKER_00]: touching enough people that they bring to
the event and that the venues and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything are going to be good and like I
said Sarah can do it Sarah can pull it off
[SPEAKER_00]: so I hope to see some of you guys out
there at the Karma Cup September 9th and
[SPEAKER_00]: 10th I'll be out there should be fun
should be good do you have any UK
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers to get your bags from well so
this UK yes you can get my bags from pure
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa that is my distributor for over 10
years now Amit from pure sativa great guy
[SPEAKER_00]: great company he has good products as well
like if you get his catalog you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's good stuff I'm not sure if he
actually does retail as well as wholesale
[SPEAKER_00]: although I suspect he would just Google
pure sativa UK and you'll get that in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with them hey what's going on Ken
Sharkey Caribbean trichomes I'm sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean if you buy yourself a Karma Cup I'm
pretty sure you just get like a big I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know how it works to be honest
I would get in touch with them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma Cup calm and ask any of your more
detailed questions that require answers
[SPEAKER_00]: like about the contest and I don't think
you'll need a card but yeah if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your Michigan card you should be fine
Canada's pretty chill it's kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing because you know from
the way I look at it is this it's a double
[SPEAKER_00]: standard in the sense that showing a card
for a medical for something medical seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a breach of our Charter of Rights
here in Canada like why would I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you that I have something that I need
to take a medicine for that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous that would be like giving
diabetics a card so if they got caught
[SPEAKER_00]: with syringes they could say oh no no no
this is just a diabetic syringe I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes card and I'm allowed to have
these syringes it's completely fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous and so when I opened my vapor
bar in 2003 I would never card anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was not in my position I'm not
the police I'm not the government I have
[SPEAKER_00]: no reason why I would want to know if
someone has a card and so I allowed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense everyone who wanted to vaporize with
their own material at my vapor bar because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was not my right to ask people about
their private medical records are
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential you understand even your
dental records are confidential so come on
[SPEAKER_00]: medical records and then people are just
gonna be like hey I want to know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis medically I never claimed
that the Cecil heads are not that good
[SPEAKER_00]: actually Mike Michaels the Cecil capitate
the Cecil and the capitate stocked are two
[SPEAKER_00]: of the heads that you those are the ones
that you're mostly getting when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions with screens whether bubble
bags or dry sifting that's just a fact the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbous heads tend to stick to the leaves
on their singular cellular stocks it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost looks like they have no stock at
all they just look like a head and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck on the leaf and because of that they
don't have quite that motion and snapping
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get some of them don't get me
wrong and I'm sure the 25 micron bag is
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe with them but oil gets the majority
of them and that's why you see bubble hash
[SPEAKER_00]: never gets the same yield as oil and for
the longest time people were convinced
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were acquiring oils that were
inside the plant I am still not on that
[SPEAKER_00]: page from what I know about science all of
the glandular trichomes and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes are produced inside that
gland head not inside anywhere else of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I've separated the plant all out and
bioassayed it and I found with my own mind
[SPEAKER_00]: when I smoked all the components of the
plant that only the glandular trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me actual effect of cannabinoids and
terpenes and so my belief system is that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is where they come from and so you
it's very easy to run a batch of something
[SPEAKER_00]: with through bubble bags and then run it
through run the same stuff but that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been run you know separate two piles run
one through water hash and one runs run
[SPEAKER_00]: one through oil and you'll see clearly
that one is going to yield higher and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to yield higher because of those
bulbous heads not because there's resin
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding inside the plant or though hey
science could tell me that that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: case tomorrow and trust me I would learn
about it and I would accept it I'm mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: accepting like skunk man Sam of the truth
whatever the truth may be the first strain
[SPEAKER_00]: of real bubble I ever made was
shishkeberry I had made a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: batches prior to that and I don't even
remember and then really the real real
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble the real first bubble that kind of
beyond blew me away was yeah 15 times
[SPEAKER_00]: that's well if you put enough material in
there you could wash it 15 times
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely for me here's the thing there's
only a certain yield to be had on these
[SPEAKER_00]: materials it's very easy to find that
yield you can squish it with your hair
[SPEAKER_00]: straightener or your rosin press and that
will give you your glandular trichome full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum yield it'll tell you whether you
have 17 percent or 21 percent or 13
[SPEAKER_00]: percent and through that number you can
then go and run it through bubble and
[SPEAKER_00]: really get an idea bubble hash is
extremely efficient I can get 90 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the medicine off of the plant
the medicine that I'm looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that I want to inhale the
microencapsulated trichome heads that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and you know so I've always
found people that are washing it many many
[SPEAKER_00]: many many many many times or they're
trying to make their freezer colder or
[SPEAKER_00]: their washer colder I just ask them are
what is the deal with that like what are
[SPEAKER_00]: you improving on because water hash is so
simple and so perfect that it's like you
[SPEAKER_00]: use water and ice and you break the glands
and they sink if you're getting your yield
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what is the purpose you know what
I mean is are there claims that oh I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched it 15 times so instead of getting
12 percent I got 29 percent I guarantee
[SPEAKER_00]: you not I guarantee you you can get the
majority of your yield in a very very
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time so these people
they're coming up with all sorts of unique
[SPEAKER_00]: things and I get it I think personally
it's more connected to the way we all are
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we want to do things through our
own lenses and it's it's kind of like it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it ours as well I saw that from day
one of starting the bubble bags because I
[SPEAKER_00]: would just put the directions out I never
felt like I owned the directions I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was sharing them and as I was
sharing them people would say oh I do it
[SPEAKER_00]: different I do it different they were all
coming up with their own text which
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidentally enough created their own
companies that's fine for me I never felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like I owned it I felt like I was sharing
information that people needed to know and
[SPEAKER_00]: so the only reason I even came up with the
name bubble and bubble hash and bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: was because I didn't want to bite anything
that the isolator company had already done
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to stay away from any type of
that energy so I could just do my own
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and since I did that it's turned in
much more to a just everyone kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: creating it like oh well I make ice oil I
make ice wax I make solvent list I make
[SPEAKER_00]: and people would contact me and say what's
the difference and I'd be like well to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest they're all guys using my bags
making water hash so I would call bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash I started calling it water hash
because it was more accurate in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know all the bags will make water
hash it's just about isolating glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome hash to the to the best of your
abilities and then there are simple sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of little truths little tips that if you
follow the simple tips like keeping it
[SPEAKER_00]: cold keep lots of ice present don't over
mix don't over stuff simple things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize when you do those things the
sweet spot of your extraction and by that
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean quality that's another thing
people got all wrong it's purity bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash is about purity we're isolating
glands to 99.9 percent gland head ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: it had nothing it has nothing to do with
quality it may unveil quality but trust me
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're using bags to make hash you
are not making or responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of said hash now if you grew that
material then you are somewhat responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: you and the genetics did a great job and
the resin is melty and the bubble bags
[SPEAKER_00]: have spoken they are the word of God when
it comes to purity and quality because
[SPEAKER_00]: generally if you purified a 99.9 percent
heads and it's not melting everyone always
[SPEAKER_00]: says the same thing what's wrong with my
material and I'll start with it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: your genetics it could be you it could be
you and your genetics like those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: three main combinations that are going to
be responsible for why your bubble is not
[SPEAKER_00]: melting if you're the grower of your
material I wash a couple hundred grams dry
[SPEAKER_00]: you know maybe six to seven hundred wet in
a five gallon batch and I make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ton of yeah lack of and you can
call it lack of love you can call it lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of focus lack of attention but that's what
it is people are just being loose with
[SPEAKER_00]: things and the bags the bags were always
meant to be a very simple tool that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could you know test materials with you
could learn about how well you grew you
[SPEAKER_00]: could you could check your efficacy your
efficiency I should say how well you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: that resin will be shown in the resin that
you extract from the bags they are bags of
[SPEAKER_00]: truth I've always called them the word of
God when it comes to the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: product because they're gonna get
everything else away and then all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods started popping up of
people because people if you ever do yoga
[SPEAKER_00]: you will learn that what people love to do
is compensate and they love to lean and
[SPEAKER_00]: they love to kind of take the easiest path
whatever it is they'll compensate to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there and so those compensations happened
in water hash with fresh frozen and with
[SPEAKER_00]: micro planing when you use fresh frozen
you are using a wax membrane latent
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal head that is filled with moisture
okay there's a lot of moisture in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see it in the photos when you
photograph fresh herb if you've seen mine
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks beautiful like a like a
full-blown water balloon I just happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a beautiful picture here in a frame
on my desktop so you see the quality there
[SPEAKER_00]: there you have Cecil trichomes and
capitate stocks capitate stock being the
[SPEAKER_00]: top one and the low ones the small ones
being the Cecil now if you look closely on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tall one you see these tiny tiny two
little dots right here you might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to make them out but what those are
and they're actually all over here I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell because they just every little dot of
shining shimmery circle is one of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: these are male pollen this is one of Dr.
Atomic's breeding projects that he did
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a DJ short blueberry and I
believe he smacked it up with I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: say one of his powerful powerful strong
northern light men so I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever became of that but yeah these
fresh frozen methods leaving the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content in the membrane a lot of people
nowadays just don't believe you can even
[SPEAKER_00]: make full melt with dry material because
people are so far from the tens the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly grown perfectly you know terpene
rich cultivars and I'm not saying everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get me wrong I see some beautiful
bubble hash being posted on Instagram so
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to all of you guys and girls
that are making it happen it's great to
[SPEAKER_00]: see but I think that the majority of
people still aren't really learning that
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the aspects of bubble bags is is
that they can teach you how to get better
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you ignore that lesson and you just
start blasting your shit and going down
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil path I think that you won't be as
well off for it you know not to say you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do the oil path as long as you're
also still learning the best weed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever seen that's a hard one I see a
lot of best weed if you can imagine you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I've seen some pretty crazy LA you
know just like the fucking gnarly crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful fall colors cookies and just
shit that you can see the the the texture
[SPEAKER_00]: from across the room when it's sitting on
your table I remember when Gold Coast came
[SPEAKER_00]: out one time with some really nice cookies
they had on my table in Amsterdam but also
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of exotic hazes the mullum bimby
madness was a beautiful plant I wish I had
[SPEAKER_00]: more pictures of it I really have an
affinity for cannabis so I appreciate all
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of it and I appreciate much more
than just one particular style if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine BX on oh yeah you need to meet my
hammer here it is and see you later buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: peace out sorry to say but BX in A&W yeah
bump we bumped him don't they know about
[SPEAKER_00]: the hammer I mean you'd think at this
point in time word would have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: around we slay the trolls here much like
we slay the bulls they rhyme so it's easy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how it goes bad hammer in your nose
that's how it goes in your nose nice I see
[SPEAKER_00]: what you did there I see what you did
there I like that I like that it's good to
[SPEAKER_00]: be chilling with all of you you know 267
people in the room we're picking up you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's it's starting to get a little
bit more more people in the room not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: to the level of hash church at this point
in time but hey it's a small group and I
[SPEAKER_00]: like it yeah we try to run a tight ship
here you know we're not gonna yeah maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl for the troll how about that you ever
do cocaine you know I did cocaine only a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of times maybe even only no no I
did it twice I remember I did it twice and
[SPEAKER_00]: both times I absolutely fucking hated it I
was quite young definitely you know for my
[SPEAKER_00]: style of personality someone who's already
going very fast and who processes
[SPEAKER_00]: information quite quickly cocaine is no
bueno for the bubble man and of course I
[SPEAKER_00]: was very young the one time I did it was
also the same way as trying coffee which
[SPEAKER_00]: also didn't agree with me and fucked me up
and put me in the shitter for an hour I
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to stay awake I was traveling
across Canada all the way from Manitoba to
[SPEAKER_00]: BC and you know these fucking degenerates
I was with were like oh yeah try try a
[SPEAKER_00]: bump of this well let me tell you a bump
of that was like the worst experience I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had so not good not a fun experience
and yeah I just can't do it oh you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet the bandhammer you want me to suck
your balls how about I slam your balls
[SPEAKER_00]: into the fucking how about that all right
did you could you know I don't consume
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine like I said the same trip after
having that horrible experience which
[SPEAKER_00]: lasted way longer than I wanted it to I
ended up trying caffeine to stay awake I
[SPEAKER_00]: was really exhausted and I just I didn't
want to sleep and and wake up dead in this
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle because the guy driving was like
maybe he shouldn't have been driving
[SPEAKER_00]: either way I tried the coffee and then
that was even worse it was just you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: never did try meth I'm kind of glad
because of the cocaine experience I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was good with psychedelics and
cannabis from a young age never tried
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin no need to try some of these more
extreme drugs but I did I have to admit I
[SPEAKER_00]: did try cocaine I'm not proud of it I'm
not proud of it I think that if more if
[SPEAKER_00]: most people were honest when you're
younger that's the thing about raising
[SPEAKER_00]: kids is kind of scary that when you're
younger and you're becoming who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna become you try things and so that as
a parent is of course the scariest thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried opium one time as well and it was no
good no good for me as well I thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: that was bad I said I did I did try opium
it was it made me feel well much like
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol to be honest real spinny in my
head and I don't like alcohol either I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it a handful of times and just never
liked it at all so I felt pretty lucky to
[SPEAKER_00]: not have it in my life all these years
yeah shrooms for the win probably one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my most how does harmala affect a mushroom
trip well it's harmaline and harming there
[SPEAKER_00]: are two components that sort of
potentially potentiate the the tryptamine
[SPEAKER_00]: high Terrence McKenna talks about it a
little bit in I think it was archaic
[SPEAKER_00]: revival no maybe true no archaic revival
it was about his brother they did this
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy potentiation it's basically like you
know tryptamine can be a very short trip
[SPEAKER_00]: you can intensify it with the harming and
the harmaline you've got to Google these
[SPEAKER_00]: names and you'll probably find out a lot
more information than what I currently
[SPEAKER_00]: know but it's definitely interesting oh
really I will smoke you sweet skunk thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for that quite the surprise ginger tea
will soothe the stomach yeah no shit all
[SPEAKER_00]: right are we hitting again hey bubble man
I have to ask you what's your opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: about extraterrestrials and have you ever
been unacknowledged unacknowledged what
[SPEAKER_00]: does that mean by dr. Stephen Greer the
name sounds so familiar I don't think I
[SPEAKER_00]: have been unacknowledged by Stephen Greer
my and what do I think about
[SPEAKER_00]: extraterrestrials that's a good one you
know that's a pretty good one because I
[SPEAKER_00]: will say that I was I read all the crazy
conspiracy books back in the day from
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Anton Wilson led me into Terrence
and all the psychedelic visionaries but
[SPEAKER_00]: then I kind of got into David Ike who was
just out there completely and I read like
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham Hancock and I read what's the other
guy all of it like from all all the little
[SPEAKER_00]: walks from like about you know Enki and
Enlil and oh oh Zachariah Sitchin the 12
[SPEAKER_00]: planet series which I felt was just a
really enjoyable book whether it was true
[SPEAKER_00]: or not the stories were incredible and
they sort of resonated with me that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was this potential of a planet on an
elliptical orbit with our planet that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know came here to mine gold for their
planet because they fucked their shit up
[SPEAKER_00]: with their technology pretty interesting
story written on Sumerian you know multi
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand ten and fifteen and twenty
thousand year old stone tablets found all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world and I found it interesting
I try not to really grasp and believe
[SPEAKER_00]: anything fervently these days other than
cannabis truths and knowledge otherwise I
[SPEAKER_00]: just I'm always afraid of people like that
that just that they believe what they
[SPEAKER_00]: believe so fervently that's why it's so
easy to laugh at the flat earthers and not
[SPEAKER_00]: just the flat earthers but also the people
who argue with them and say no no no the
[SPEAKER_00]: world is round I have no card in the game
but it just sounds so ridiculous that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed me to be a little more open with
my belief system but yeah Zachariah
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitchin had some pretty good information
about you know and it's it's sort of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of combines and resonates with me in the
sense that you know we seem like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: these different versions of the apes that
are naturally here and in the story of
[SPEAKER_00]: course they took the ape DNA and put it
into their DNA and created their their
[SPEAKER_00]: servants which were humans and then the
story goes that the Apple of knowledge the
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam and Eve story which this predates by
like 8,000 years which it predates all the
[SPEAKER_00]: religious textures by many many thousands
of years which is unique because all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the religious stories repeat themselves
and when you know that these stories were
[SPEAKER_00]: even older and they're slightly different
it's pretty cool but you know does it
[SPEAKER_00]: change my day-to-day life do I go around
trying to convince people yeah possibly I
[SPEAKER_00]: see that there's a dichotomy in the human
beings on this planet that some of us want
[SPEAKER_00]: to just hang out by the bonfire and live
in a teepee and smoke the peace pipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: then others want to build metal spaceships
and fly to other planets it seems like we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit of both going on there
so who thinks satellites and dinosaurs are
[SPEAKER_00]: fake?
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I try oh good morning Fatta Mike
Korean natural farming can repair the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and grow our full melt hash for
pennies on the ground well that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking gig I want to grow hash for
pennies on the ground you know who thinks
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs are real I agree bubble man yeah you
know go with it on your own try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe blindly in anything you know
particularly the opposite of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe yeah John Dover I have a few of
them on my on my Facebook but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I have to say I laugh equally at the
people who argue with them because the
[SPEAKER_00]: funny thing is they start talking about
math oh I know math that can prove it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the bottom line is this have you been
outside of the earth and looked at it the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer is no so then that's why I laugh at
everyone you know using each other using
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's information that could
easily be manipulated as proof to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other person why you're right and they're
wrong it's just seriously the most
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous thing ever so I think it's time
for another dab what do we say anyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: here use Ativan no Mike Michaels I would
stay the shit away from that stuff it
[SPEAKER_00]: turned my friend into a zombie really and
you know for those people that say it
[SPEAKER_00]: works okay I'm sorry but I worry about
using pharmaceutical drugs to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: your anxiety or how you feel that's a very
dangerous dangerous game what friend you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't know him it was a long time ago
now but he was the most normal of people
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm telling you that Ativan completely
changed his personality he became really
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive really really aggressive don't
do it that's what I say
[SPEAKER_00]: good for you Larry what do you think about
alchemy and hermetics bubble man well what
[SPEAKER_00]: little I know about it I think it's quite
interesting I love the concept of alchemy
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd often tell people that's what bubble
hash was they'd be like this is science
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like it's actually a little bit
more alchemy yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just got to be better ways to deal
with these anxieties I think it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important that we find them because these
pills that mimic you know and and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate these feelings and then
coincidentally have side effects that are
[SPEAKER_00]: suicidal thoughts these these that's not
good to go from a little bit anxious or
[SPEAKER_00]: even a lot anxious right to suicidal
thoughts that's something that I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be looking at it in our society you
know we're not allowed to smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and drive a vehicle but potentially the
person who's driving the school bus that
[SPEAKER_00]: your kid sits on is able to take an extra
added event if he or she so chooses it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of freaky I'm not saying they
shouldn't be allowed I'm just saying maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know so I could make the
decision you know rather than just I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: all about trying to make everyone not be
able to do anything that's not my
[SPEAKER_00]: intention hear the jazz dissolving off
yeah just cleaning the chas chasin chasin
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning the chasin it's good to get it
clean yeah I wish we could share photos on
[SPEAKER_00]: here too that would be kind of a nice
thing yeah yeah I can I can that'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be for tomorrow though let's see what
we got chas prevention is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine yes the D chasin or did you guys
go check out Chasie banger or Chasie
[SPEAKER_00]: bangers on Instagram it's almost too hard
to believe it's almost like looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: car accident you just can't stop watching
as you drive by it's it's Chas bangers and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're quite proud of them go check it
out yes this is no boy no FSS how you
[SPEAKER_00]: doing FSS since our conversation you know
I thought you said SSS I knew your name
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't SSS I don't remember an SSS and I
have a pretty good memory when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit so when I saw the other day and
asked her to someone say FSS I was like ah
[SPEAKER_00]: there it is I get it hope you're doing
well anyway brother it was nice talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with you the other day and talking to you
right now say hi to your wife Katie for me
[SPEAKER_00]: Katie's a sweetie doing the good job
loving her husband it's nice when our
[SPEAKER_00]: partners can take care of us like that and
just step out a little bit to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: special those are the important things
those are the signs of true love that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know someone loves you when they go out of
their way to just shoot an arrow out
[SPEAKER_00]: Griffin will someone explain to me what is
this I guess that depends on what this
[SPEAKER_00]: you're referring to are you holding
something in your hand that we can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: are you referring to this live chat that
currently we're all in what what what yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is just a chat this is kind
of a like trying to get you going on the
[SPEAKER_00]: day maybe a little bit of inspiration
while we puff a few bowls you know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all cannabis aficionados here so we're
promoting the endocannabinoid system which
[SPEAKER_00]: is of course a system that uses
cannabinoids which cannabis is ripe with
[SPEAKER_00]: to regulate our biological functions from
the first breath to the last breath that
[SPEAKER_00]: we take basically our entire lives all of
our biological functions so this is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we talk about it used to it
started out as oh we're all smoking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's illegal and then we learned that
it actually regulates our biological
[SPEAKER_00]: functions and can keep a lot of disease
and sickness out of our lives if we just
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent it by staying in homeostasis and
what homeostasis is think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system as the crank on
your bicycle and each pedal one is the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system and one is the central
nervous system when all the ball bearings
[SPEAKER_00]: and the grease is all working perfectly
you have homeostasis and what that does in
[SPEAKER_00]: the body obviously is it feels good you
feel good when you're in homeostasis and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're healthy you go to the bathroom
regularly you sleep well you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: memory your appetite is healthy all of
these things stay regulated when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing endocannabinoid deficiency by
consuming cannabinoids now if cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't your bag don't worry you can produce
these endogenously in your body which also
[SPEAKER_00]: tells us how important they are not only
endogenously through the consumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: essential amino acids which you can get
through hemp seed once again thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or different things like salmon
and different fish that have fatty acids
[SPEAKER_00]: in them GLNAs and GLAs they're all there
for our consumption and our enjoyment and
[SPEAKER_00]: then one more thing to lay on you when we
start our life if you can imagine the the
[SPEAKER_00]: the negative stereotypes against cannabis
like oh look at that guy's got puffy red
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes he's all stoned or look at them they
got the munchies well those actually flip
[SPEAKER_00]: in the medical world puffy red eyes he's
stoned equals granny's not gonna lose her
[SPEAKER_00]: sight because she's able to reduce her
ocular pressure with cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating one's appetite may look funny
to the stoner stereotype looking out at it
[SPEAKER_00]: but in reality stimulating an appetite if
one suffering from wasting syndrome from
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the AIDS medications or when one
is starting one's life and suckling on the
[SPEAKER_00]: nipple of your mother the breast milk is
ripe with cannabinoids these cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: are inducing appetite and the the initial
latching of the baby to the breast is the
[SPEAKER_00]: is the absolute stereotype of the munchies
that's how all life on earth is sustained
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids produce and regulate
biological functions so there it is from
[SPEAKER_00]: me to you that's what this is I think that
was a pretty good little drop I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: let you guys go because I've been babbling
on for probably a lot longer oh thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: Griffin right on brother we will
appreciate having you here dude this is
[SPEAKER_00]: good information that you can share with
people that might still be locked away
[SPEAKER_00]: into the propaganda based prohibition
based mentality of cannabis that is
[SPEAKER_00]: showing them that they still see the
negative stereotypes and you might need to
[SPEAKER_00]: flip the coin for a few of those people
and I think it'll be easier for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: flip that coin if you have some of this
knowledge that I just shared I do this six
[SPEAKER_00]: days a week and then on the seventh day
it's kind of a steroid version where I
[SPEAKER_00]: invite a panel of amazing cannabis
aficionados to come and share their
[SPEAKER_00]: information with all of you so yeah be man
very locked away so many don't care it's
[SPEAKER_00]: true trichome city what you gonna do thank
you chalice chugger much appreciation I
[SPEAKER_00]: love seeing all the familiar faces in here
every day have a great day everybody and
[SPEAKER_00]: may the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later peace out you
