[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's world everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our last days here in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last day for us, we gotta head back to the
island tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, well we gotta finish it off with a
bang.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something big.
[SPEAKER_06]: 125 km an hour day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so this is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are having a few bowls before we go off
to the Olympic Sliding Center here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Whistler on Blackhall Mountain and we're
gonna go in these bobslays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four man bobslays like you saw in the
Olympics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go 125 miles an hour up on an ice wall
and the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: The unity and the community team.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they'll let us purchase a
video of us sliding down in the bobsled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would be, if we can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whistler bobsledding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see, you read the whole thing and
one of the things says be prepared for
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely or fairly strenuous workout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean everything, like Flav mentioned
earlier, he said everything in Whistler is
[SPEAKER_02]: hard and strenuous.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any sort of condition.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can't get in and out of the
bobsled, you're not allowed to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole list of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't keep up with them running
with the bobsled, you might get dragged.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you weigh too much, if you weigh too
little.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ran over by Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark and Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: The brake guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I'm not in charge of braking.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanna steer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm steering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they let you steer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I originally thought you were actually
gonna do the skeleton.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do the skeleton.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_12]: Does he go head first with the skeleton?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you just?
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe.
[SPEAKER_12]: You tuck your arms in and you just go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chin first.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they just strap you in and there's
nothing that you can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: It blew me away.
[SPEAKER_12]: That they let people do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's only like a quarter of the track
with the skeleton.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just don't think it has the,
you have the option to gain the 150
[SPEAKER_12]: kilometers an hour that the real skeleton
pros get to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that seven year Master Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes nothing like Master Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes like the most insane like perfumey
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure we're ending a big trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been six days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been up here having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have seen a little bit of what
we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the skiing and snowboarding and a
little bit of the sledding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, of course, the bob sledding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the tubing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have some footage of the tubing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll make sure they see that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep forgetting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as we've just chilled,
we have done quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seven year hash hits like a champ too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fill that piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can get rid of it pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the butt end of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm ready for some bobsledding now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to film as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe just driving up to the sliding
center.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show them a little bit of footage of
walking into the center and seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think they've ever been bobsledding
on weed?
[SPEAKER_12]: They've never been bobsledding on weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: On an Olympic course.
[SPEAKER_12]: On the Olympic bobsled course.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the crazy part of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like yeah, bobsledding.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a hard course.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a treacherous course.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the world of bobsledding, it's one of
the fastest, most dangerous courses that
[SPEAKER_12]: there is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it true?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the first days of the
Olympics.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was too fast.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they just shortened it down.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was a Russian guy, one of the top guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved the course.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a young guy and there's actually a
memorial for him walking out of Lower
[SPEAKER_02]: Village into Upper Village.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on the right side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he doing the skeleton?
[SPEAKER_02]: Looj.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure it was Looj.
[SPEAKER_02]: On his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skeleton is head first on your stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course the bobsled is all four
of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well three of us and one guy inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's either going to be... Steering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have Flav with us and we also have
Sarah with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between the five of us, we're all going
to go into separate... Twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
Once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well once or twice we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the skeleton.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you did the skeleton you got to do it
twice.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember saying I have to do it twice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I start off somewhere lower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe just slide?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I say we get ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all four of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to head down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bobsledding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so we have made it up to the
Whistler Sliding Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slide like an Olympian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try public bobsleigh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got your pics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our social media pics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to drive over a BMW when we come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he thinks he needs the middle of
the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a big truck bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so Mountain Access Road Track
Operating Building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guest Services Refrigeration Plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Whistler Sliding Area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say straight no?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Access Road and Track Operations
Building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright let's do guest services.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we're one of the guest services.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they'll take us up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the wall right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man this is freaky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of room for my truck in there
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just peak to peak gondola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty excited about this whole scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave that spot for Dave and I'll go
for the firewood.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is super super stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no this guy's truck is bigger than
mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I feel small?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should we just assume that he is a much
smaller wiener than I?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably in the wrong spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guest and athlete check in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we athletes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No but we're guest services.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guest services is definitely where you'd
go if you wanted to say be a guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks like the right spot for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well because you're on the mountain so
it's like everybody here is a guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spoiled customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey look the warning area under video
surveillance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should walk in and say warning you're
all under my surveillance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check Republic race director.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright let's sign some death waivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's John Montgomery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baron and Matt are just signing their life
away on the if I die it's not Whistler's
[SPEAKER_02]: fault.
[SPEAKER_14]: Form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You filled that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: He signed it over to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your death form?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't sign that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Aaron signing his soul over to
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't sign that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't sign that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't fill out the whole paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show a little bit of action
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Skeleton medalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luge medalist.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't fill it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we cutting it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we cutting it close Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take all that stuff out of your
pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that hoodie off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a lot of stuff on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hoodie probably weighs like 18
pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this where you have to tell people you
can't go on because you weigh too much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a realistic thing that happens
often?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well it doesn't happen often.
[SPEAKER_13]: You tell them before.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do it dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him some special shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about a bodysuit?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some flip flops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, flip flops on a bodysuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might look a bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just put some second skin on his hands
instead of gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I weigh way under 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can go on my sled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to keep it down to a certain
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: High five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew you were making it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a 180 or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to go too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottom line, faster or slower,
three big dudes in a sled.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's saying enough right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get out, will you be handing
us a pitcher of beer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how that works?
[SPEAKER_02]: Arlen does wish that was the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear it in his accent.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's drinking some beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large or medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Going for the LG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks way big.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it fit good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Flavid Sarah getting sorted out in
the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the live feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be able to walk for 15 minutes up a steep
slope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be able to hold their weight firmly on the
sled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys ready for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: We could.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's just give it to the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to wear my hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're videotaping here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't have our hats off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take our hats off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of people going bobsledding,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still drunk from New Year's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never even drank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool how they've got all the
country's flags.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the first test to see if you can walk
the 15 minutes up the hill.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like all harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder why we're going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go down before you can go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get in before you can get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to lock the truck before you go
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another fun experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's be honest, bobsleigh,
that's unity in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go down together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love bobsledding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever done the bobsled on weed?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the bobsled track right here
that we're beside.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the giant wall corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, for $180, they don't drive us up?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got to be able to walk up,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going on the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're going to a van, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a little cool fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no brakes on a skeleton sled.
[SPEAKER_02]: They slow them down by dragging their
feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still want to do the skeleton there,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_12]: No brakes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just push you down.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no stopping whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a talon on your toe to slow
you down.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I could get to the bottom, my toe would
be gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I lost my toe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Took it off on the ice, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was five pounds over the weight
limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you get, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take us up on those little
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the course right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember watching that thing on the
other sled.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, just for anyone who actually hasn't
been out here before, this is corner 15,
[SPEAKER_08]: which leads into 16, which is the big wide
open corner.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where you'll be going the
fastest.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll probably be hitting like 125,
126 maybe today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually see the marks of the sled
on those four logos.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that actually goes up like above the
logos and back down through the wisteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're signing them back up
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll be coming down this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually the outrun over that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that starts to go back up to help you
slow down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, when we finish the
presentation, we'll bring everyone back
[SPEAKER_08]: down here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And anyone who isn't in the first two
slides will get to watch the first two
[SPEAKER_08]: slides coming down, which is pretty cool
because that's when everyone starts to
[SPEAKER_08]: change their mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should grab a seat or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grabbing seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let Sarah have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's nice, that heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you feeling about this,
Dave?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm feeling pretty excited about this,
actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm starting to go down 120k.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a bad slope.
[SPEAKER_02]: 125 kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabbed out of our skulls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabbed out of your skulls?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm praying.
[SPEAKER_02]: To who?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't show you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is on like Donkey Kong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting real right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is straight happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're heading back down the sliding
center.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're going to see inside there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder where people can come and watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could they come right up here and stand
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what Aaron said he was
going to try to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, is that the guy that headbutts the
pilot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and you can't bend your back?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're calling reverse shotgun on me?
I don't want shotgun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go down there and around
here and back up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good shot right there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you feel it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you set a track record?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still coughing from the last one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Safety break before we go bob-cladding.
[SPEAKER_14]: No smoking on the track.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's essential.
[SPEAKER_14]: No smoking on the track.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are rebels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I have anxiety now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always pay for your water,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Matt knows how to share genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whistler sliding center.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's hanging out with Benji.
[SPEAKER_09]: We load him onto the back of a flatbed and
then just drive him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is pretty much how everything gets
brought up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have seen them bring the cable
up from the peak to peak gondola.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a documentary on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: How do they get the cable from one side to
the other?
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually just strain along the valley
floor and then slowly tighten it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to cut like a path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, they cut a lot of trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a really nice ski run.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so sick on both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you, if you don't know how
far that last road is and you end up down
[SPEAKER_02]: in the creek, it's not fun as a
snowboarder.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going to give you this camera to
take back down if you don't mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after we're done, you guys drive us
back down?
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pick you up at the finish dock and
then take you back down to the lodge there
[SPEAKER_09]: where you guys can pick up your
certificates.
[SPEAKER_09]: That we participated in?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Olympic sliding, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it has like the team photo on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the top or is this like the
seventh turn?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is corner seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were hoping to send people from
yourselves, but during testing,
[SPEAKER_09]: we found it was just a little too intense.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 10 kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just adds to the Gs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adds to the Gs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like Gs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really not sure if I want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, unity in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that guy just tell us that works here?
[SPEAKER_11]: He said that he works here and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: not excited or nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not nervous, you're not going to
have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to take the driver with you?
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't tell you any admissions?
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that you made it out to that
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go on this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the helmet I tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, they're wiping eyes over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which one do we want?
[SPEAKER_13]: I want the thunder on ice.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're both thunder on ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are in the other team.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to beat you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking the title, right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going for 40.31.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's your red sled, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like you liked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really school these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the red sled.
Yep.
Right this way.
Coach.
One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a beautiful guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Ricky comes in, that makes you go
faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another driver is just like, yeah,
just go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the Google Blobsled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Blobsled.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what he used to say to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: He used Google Maps to figure this thing
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: See you in the helmets, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bend it perfectly straight, but don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even for a second, when Dave held his arms
up, I was like, whoa, that's not math.
[SPEAKER_04]: Count those ducks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure they're down.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Control from start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go, go, go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still coughing from the last one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Safety break before we go bobsledding.
[SPEAKER_14]: No smoking on the track.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's essential.
[SPEAKER_14]: No smoking on the track.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are rebels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I have anxiety now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Olympian's second place silver
medalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we train.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on the bobsled team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt and Flav.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got dupes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got Sherleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got Sherlocks and Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we train.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over here, we've got Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back over here, we've got Flav.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Big Booger in the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sucked it up right at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, gold medalists, silver
medalists.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got another first for DNA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another win for DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another second for the great Gardner and
Flav.
[SPEAKER_03]: First Whistler Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man, I'm just here for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the first place, but I don't know
if I accept that or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, booby doo boobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take the Sherlock, actually,
once you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a little rip with the Shirley.
[SPEAKER_06]: First ever Whistler Invitational bobsled
championships.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little help from my friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: A collab between Bubble Man and DNA won
the cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Went down the course faster than anyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here comes Sarah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes Sarah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes Sarah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here comes Sarah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second place.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I think our driver just did not give
a fuck at that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, he's a bloody Liverpool fan.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish he died.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the coach.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damien?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it kind of violent?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a Liverpool fan.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, he's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was yours kind of violent, like a violent
run?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: The run was violent.
Really?
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of violent?
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of violent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Try sitting at the back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Try sitting at the back.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like asking the guy, I'm like,
how do you drive?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you drive like that?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but you've got all the G's.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like a blur.
[SPEAKER_12]: You sat at the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got off the back and the guy was like,
oh, you got all the G's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, all the G's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I thought I got all the G's.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sunk in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sunk in my spine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spine is just like coming out my ass.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we went around the second last
turn and I didn't see the Whistler sign.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, oh my God, we still have the
Whistler turn.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw my wife standing there with my
daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah was like, I heard Sarah screaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, no, that was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, no, no, you were in a
different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard you screaming, too, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottom line, if you haven't been to
Whistler yet, if you're thinking of coming
[SPEAKER_02]: to Whistler to have a fun filled vacation,
with friends, herb and good food,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would suggest that this has definitely
been a fucking top notch trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: With top notch folks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's snowing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's snowing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can do the skeleton next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do the skeleton.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I could.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could do the skeleton now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it was easier than the Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Safer and easier.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe him.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we went with the dude who's
like not the guy and he was laughing at
[SPEAKER_02]: the two dudes that were standing over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, you see those dudes
over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, they're really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, they go more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the, the, the, the, the,
the elders kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, he was like, because we had the coach
on our side.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: The guy that those guys got over there,
he used to work at Arby's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Liverpool guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why he loved it when he got to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, first, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said to me, he said, look at those guys
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed they're just kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the guy that was the driver
before us, we got to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing he said to us is,
I shouldn't give you the tips on how to go
[SPEAKER_12]: faster.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause we beat him.
[SPEAKER_12]: He got third, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it's all about the push.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: A hundredth of a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is why they have to be so big and
strong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, the guy that the,
the big Canadian guy that won,
[SPEAKER_11]: he was the next football.
[SPEAKER_11]: John Montgomery.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to seal off,
sign off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching bubble man's world.
