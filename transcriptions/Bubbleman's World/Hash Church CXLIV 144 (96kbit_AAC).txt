[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Hash Church, episode 144.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for being a few minutes late there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was, of course, doing a little research.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not gonna lie, got a little stuck on the
research.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm gonna send out the links.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pop that down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope everyone's doing well today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna, of course, get the links
out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing a little bit of research today,
trying to find out what companies have
[SPEAKER_09]: been lobbying the Canadian government to
shut down dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a little bit interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that easy, because a lot of these
groups do, you know, they hire a group to
[SPEAKER_09]: do their lobbying for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure we'll end up talking about it
a little bit here today.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, let me make sure I got
those links all sent off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Todd.
[SPEAKER_06]: And arousing fuck Mickey this morning,
because we lost a good activist this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because fuck Mickey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because fuck Mickey, and God bless him,
love him, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I talked a little bit about him on
my wake and bake show yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe mute your mic there, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, Johnny B, and Skunk Man Sam,
and Todd McCormick, as well as Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, long ribs for Mickey this
morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another cannabis activist has passed away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never knew him as a cannabis activist,
as much as I knew him as an internet
[SPEAKER_09]: troll.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't say that as a negative.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really only knew him as that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And seeing the beautiful, wonderful things
that people have said to him, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_09]: much concerned.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that they're not saying it just
because he's passed away.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy actually did some great things and
had a lot of people actually loving him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So rest in peace, Mickey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the good work that you did in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Mickey was a pioneer in the edibles
here in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was busted and did his time and
took his lumps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, always, yeah, he was definitely
a troll.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave people their shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a shit stir, but he was our shit
stir.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was never afraid to call everyone and
anyone out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very fortunate not to be on the shit
list.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, if you were,
you received some wrath.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was usually justifiably so.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't just pick on anybody,
just pick on anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was doing shit, and he gave you the
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if I will ever replace
somebody like him in our movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Irreplaceable, but I just want to send out
my love to his family and friends.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Debbie Gildsbury and many others
just writing really great shit about him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's always nice to see when people
have nice things to say about people
[SPEAKER_09]: rather than the tossing of them under the
bus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was waiting for Darren to see Bonerip,
but he's not in yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even see him in the room yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Darren, get in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's everyone doing this fine,
fine morning?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm alive and well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're glad that you're alive and well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just doing Bonerips, loving you,
missing you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bonerips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some dabbins?
[SPEAKER_09]: Some dabbins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat is moving so fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked over at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like... Well, it wouldn't be
dabbing together sift if it wasn't for you
[SPEAKER_07]: and Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be smoking sift every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Bonerip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if it wasn't for you growing your
own weed, give yourself a pat on the back,
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love growing my own.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should all be doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was over there this morning and just
soaking up the plant's life and just
[SPEAKER_07]: talking to her and just having a great
conversation, putting her outside in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just one of those things you do when
you're a gardener.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at Darren and he's got
plants and flowers and vegetables all
[SPEAKER_07]: around his place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got hanging baskets and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get up with the sun just to get the
ladies going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like talking to your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people here talk to their plants
whenever they're working with their
[SPEAKER_06]: plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd's like, I don't talk to my plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got work to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ignore them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I give my plants the passive aggressive
cold shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give them orders is what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please grow plant, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that works as much as love,
care, nutrients, air, water, light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go with those things first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the dank Duchess is in the in the
room right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she says she does talk to her plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she's saying that she said me with
a smiley face.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Darren, Mr. D for 20 K.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, rip mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're late, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already done that whole bong rip
mother lovers thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, I can't put one over on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, get in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely plants around your house that you
have grown on and what you do grow your
[SPEAKER_07]: own guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, on that note, the other day,
I talked to my mentor, kind of letting the
[SPEAKER_09]: cat out of the bag kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if it'll manifest.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I feel if I talk about it,
especially to thousands of people,
[SPEAKER_09]: it'll be more likely to manifest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my newest dream, my newest
manifestation that I'm trying to get going
[SPEAKER_09]: is thanks to Todd for inviting forever
flowering greenhouses in here because I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: still thinking about that greenhouse
nonstop, thinking about putting it in
[SPEAKER_09]: behind my house, thinking about getting my
mentor Ron Hickey to move from his grow in
[SPEAKER_09]: the Kootenays to come out here and take
care of the grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be our grow in the backyard here
and just do shows every day with tips from
[SPEAKER_09]: Ron.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the guy has he truly knows how to
grow great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put him up there with a lot of people
that I always often say he's forgotten
[SPEAKER_09]: more about cannabis than most will ever
know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're looking forward to maybe
getting that manifestation in the next
[SPEAKER_09]: couple of months a reality, build a nice
forever flowering greenhouse in the
[SPEAKER_09]: backyard, start the project, plant a whole
crop of Congolese is what we were thinking
[SPEAKER_09]: to do in maybe 99 Congo plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think it would be great just
for the social media, for the wake and
[SPEAKER_09]: bakes, for me to be able to hang out with
one of my best and oldest friends,
[SPEAKER_09]: mentor, father figure, grandfather figure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sort of something that I'm hoping
that's going to happen in the near future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if the grow itself didn't happen and
I just got Ron out here living out here in
[SPEAKER_09]: my kid's life and my life, that to me
would be a win, win, win.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the greenhouse happens and the grow
happens, well, it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what, it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a federal license for 99 plants and
I don't have a single plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what is wrong with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of all the money you can save.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to buy pot if you just
spend a couple hundred grand growing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, it's for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because Ron and I obviously have no
interest in undermining the program and
[SPEAKER_09]: selling the pot as much as we just want
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: The value really will be in the sharing of
the information, the social media
[SPEAKER_09]: promotions, the photography that I'll be
able to get and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sort of eye candy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for me, really the real value,
I'm not going to lie, is getting to spend
[SPEAKER_09]: time with one of my mentors, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like these, you know, these guys are
getting older and older and I just,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting older and older and I want to
spend as much time as I can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I wish I had 50 plus years to spend
with my mentors, let alone the 20 or 30 or
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 that I might be limited to depending on
how long we get to live.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know Tahoe Bird.
[SPEAKER_09]: An unused federal license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go hang out with Rob and all his
college buddies yesterday at one of their
[SPEAKER_02]: reunion parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all in their sixties and it's
funny to see all these like raging hippies
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like, you know, professors and
all well-to-dos and they're still such
[SPEAKER_02]: raging hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to put it, but they're
lawyers and they're professors and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: scholars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's a cute mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows me that even stoners can grow up
to be very productive, successful members
[SPEAKER_02]: of society.
[SPEAKER_09]: And established.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the truth right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no doubt about that a stoner,
I mean, even the word stoner, it always
[SPEAKER_09]: seems to have this sort of, at least
through the prohibition lens, this
[SPEAKER_09]: negative connotation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although when I hear stoner, I think of
more positive things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to lie because well,
because I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've accepted that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with pride because what else are you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you had to accept your stoner
badge with honor because yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the misinformation and we
realized it so early.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went out and preached about it and
yelled about it and sit on street corners
[SPEAKER_06]: and people were like, what the fuck are
you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all are high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're high.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just trying to make sure everybody
is aware that we're successful and high as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're more than welcome to join us along
the way if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be honest, you wanted to get everyone
high too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's well medicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say I'm well medicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's called highly motivated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Highly motivated.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone on this panel is highly
motivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam with the cool posting the other day in
Hashtag is talking about all these cops
[SPEAKER_02]: stopping searching us after they legalized
in various states.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to say this after the whole OMA or
AMA, OMA, whatever you guys want to call
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The arguments against and for it really
seems that Todd, you may prop 64.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have fallen on the right side of
things because I'll tell you not a single
[SPEAKER_09]: person who argued against it is continuing
to, I haven't seen them say post about
[SPEAKER_09]: look at this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cops aren't even searching us anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a bunch of people got let off and had
that had charges.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need 300 grams, $300 a gram for my shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, sorry, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the people that are that were hating
it love it now because they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: sweating, driving their shit around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not worried about the cops showing
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different world right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they can all kiss my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was the right side of things to
fall on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we need to be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't be criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who thinks decriminalization
is the answer is an idiot because it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: you a criminal in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be decriminalized because we're
not fucking criminals to start off with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really surprised at how these posts
that are coming out after this Prop 64
[SPEAKER_09]: seem to be extremely positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, people that were going to be
charged having their charges dropped,
[SPEAKER_09]: cars not getting searched by cops.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, those are major, major,
major big deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reason it is so major is
because that gave them access to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, if they could get inside
your vehicle and start snooping around,
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows what they might find.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can tell you exactly what they're
going to find in my vehicle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not going to be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when I got pulled over, the first
thing they said was we can smell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that led them to my searches,
which you guys all saw live, but that
[SPEAKER_07]: does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They searched my car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which John replied, I am cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to have some.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it that I handed him the container,
but let's smell if he opened up,
[SPEAKER_07]: smelt it and gave it back to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a 44 year old flowering cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the great thing about 64 is it's
moved the line in the sand completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read, I have lawyers that I follow on
Facebook and every day I read someone else
[SPEAKER_06]: dismissed, someone else felony dismissed,
felony dismissed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would love to just stack those,
the, the 50 to a hundred that I have seen
[SPEAKER_06]: go by of people and just, you know,
re hit those people who are giving us so
[SPEAKER_06]: much shit for 64, you know, and just
remind them, Hey, you really were happy
[SPEAKER_06]: with this person going to jail or going
through this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you not worried you to not celebrate
these people not going to jail,
[SPEAKER_06]: including somebody with a staunch against
it came out and immediately had a case and
[SPEAKER_06]: immediately was thrown out right after it
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, Oh shit, I got my stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to take a loving rib on Dennis
Perrone's Facebook page after I saw that
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of cannabis cases are getting
dismissed because it's like, how could
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody in this industry not support
thousands of people getting their lives
[SPEAKER_02]: back and getting out of court and not
having to pay lawyers financially
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on the trade and you don't want
the prices to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll tell you what, it's pretty
shitty that that many people fought people
[SPEAKER_09]: that claim to be activists that fought
against prop 64.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see them doing any activist work
anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just seems to be like, what,
what, like that got real personal.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't like people were being mature
and arguing on a mature level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit got super personal, which I am
inclined to believe Sam, because the level
[SPEAKER_09]: of personal that it reached was like,
you're taking away my livelihood,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is like, guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: If your livelihood is based on people
going to prison and prohibition,
[SPEAKER_09]: fuck your livelihood and fuck you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So no offense, but come on, like that's
not a good profit margin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be like, for the Americans
perspective, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think your neighbors should go to
jail because you deserve to get high price
[SPEAKER_02]: with a pound of pot, you are an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got to say story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an insult to assholes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause assholes are useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: People in that area in that mindset are
straight up pieces of dog shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog poop.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the dog on the arm.
[SPEAKER_09]: With the dog on the arm.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's an expert in dog poop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still not seeing prices drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like here in Canada, we had a lot of legal
cannabis access for years, but
[SPEAKER_07]: legalization happens in 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see those prices drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So access accessibility will be more there
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Access for everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because this industry is a lot
of different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we, we all came from different
aspects.
[SPEAKER_09]: We led ourselves into this sort of,
you know, cannabis led us down this sort
[SPEAKER_09]: of guiding light that is, oh, there's
really a lot of good that you can do with
[SPEAKER_09]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's bigger than just getting high.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bigger than me having access to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bigger than me growing it and making
profit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you meet people like forest and you
meet, you know, these people that are,
[SPEAKER_09]: that are doing really, really incredible
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it makes you feel proud to be a part
of this industry, you know, and I'm,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but fighting against something
like proposition 64, which is going to let
[SPEAKER_09]: all those people go free and lose.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Todd, you yourself went free.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_09]: You got off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They finally, after four years of
prosecuting me, dropped the case against
[SPEAKER_02]: me because I wouldn't cooperate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I know, I know you talk, you're a
solid guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk a real game.
[SPEAKER_09]: You say, Hey, jail's not the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the world, blah, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would tell people out there who have
never been to jail and who are only
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially facing jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is serious energy that goes into
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like getting audited.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a family member passing away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes if you don't have that,
if you have that fear of like,
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, what they're taking my freedom
away.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're tick.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a heavy thing to lay on someone
for years of their life, four years of his
[SPEAKER_09]: life without even getting five.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me say this, the fear is worse
than the reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: People live through prison, get out of
prison, make meaningful lives of
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like for me, I, I self surrendered to
it way a long time back because I figured
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking with fire and there's no way
I'm not going to get burned at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm debating guys like the DEA head at the
freaking university of Miami.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty much sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a target on my back.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Joseph Petrie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fuck him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but at the same time, uh,
the reality was, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't that hard to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell anybody, anybody that's facing
any case, don't, don't fear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't run from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go up, show up, show up on time,
be polite, go through it, get out and
[SPEAKER_02]: trust me, it'll be behind you quicker than
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that I so mean that if we all threw
ourselves at the courts, the courts would
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we all pled not guilty and push them to
trial, they would not be able to afford to
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecute us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could break the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that fear inhibits our ability
to do so most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's changed the dynamics.
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 years ago for the Ed Rosenthal trial,
I had to go before grand jury and into
[SPEAKER_06]: federal court and declare my fifth and
10th amendment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that wouldn't be necessary,
you know, due to the law change.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the reasons we're also
celebrating, um, uh, the life and the
[SPEAKER_06]: passing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could still go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could still go down in this and the
stance 18 took was I will not cooperate in
[SPEAKER_02]: this prosecution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was facing fucking prison because
he wouldn't basically testify on stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, no, I plead the fifth.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, they say, okay,
you realize you can be held in contempt of
[SPEAKER_02]: court and the choice is either,
okay, speak or go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, at that point, I love you
18, you chose jail and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: should choose jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to stand in the fear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to, you can't run away from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you're subpoenaed and you're in with
the dragon's claws.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have to ride it out and you have
to hold your head high, do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have good lawyers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't capitulate.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Todd said, don't cooperate in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need for it's them to prove it
against you.
[SPEAKER_06]: No need for you to give them any more
information that they need to,
[SPEAKER_06]: to prosecute you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But dynamics are shifting and hopefully
they're, they'll shift federally.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I was saying, and one reason we're
talking and celebrating Mickey Martin's
[SPEAKER_06]: life is because he was one of us who got
busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when he was busted and after he
was busted, then he started a toy drive
[SPEAKER_06]: every winter, every Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: He started a toy drive to raise money for
toys for kids whose parents are in jail
[SPEAKER_06]: right now for life sentences or less.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he donated to it every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he started to do in the fall,
he did the same thing for back to school.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could buy them new shoes,
school equipment, anything you need to get
[SPEAKER_06]: back to school.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as you know, when somebody is in
jail, they lose everything and those kids
[SPEAKER_06]: are in foster care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or with grandparents or with a step parent
and their lives are completely upended.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will forever give mad respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they're going to rename the
toy drive for Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they should, because it was his
instigation to never forget those right
[SPEAKER_06]: now, even though we're celebrating our
victory, never forget right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody is in jail right now suffering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he never forgot that those kids and
their families were taken care of along
[SPEAKER_06]: the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just someone, not just someone that,
that is in jail either at 10, but you
[SPEAKER_09]: called it with the children, you know,
it's one thing to say, I'm going to go do
[SPEAKER_09]: jail when you have no children.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, Lois Lane, who's in the chat
room right now said her father got 10
[SPEAKER_09]: years in the 1980s for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was not there to watch her grow up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was not there to protect her.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when he came out of jail, she was a
stranger to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's an extremely serious,
heavy, heavy thing that if you don't have
[SPEAKER_09]: kids, you can't possibly imagine the level
of sacrifice that you're making when you
[SPEAKER_09]: go off to prison for five or 10 or 15
years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those, those kids just, uh,
you know, they don't get raised the same
[SPEAKER_09]: way.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, one thing I want to say is I
felt like after five years of like living
[SPEAKER_02]: in and out of a visiting room in a U S
prison, I watch families.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what it does to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons I was such an
advocate of 64 is because something has to
[SPEAKER_02]: stop child protective services from
disrupting families and ripping us apart
[SPEAKER_02]: from our, from our kids or from our
parents and putting us through hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that's really what's
happening because our parents don't drink
[SPEAKER_02]: wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoke a little pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that their families get ripped
apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's a horrible situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, those poor kids are doing time
with their parents and that's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're locking up some dad for
growing flowers and that poor kid is
[SPEAKER_02]: crying every night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kid is missing his dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kid doesn't have mentoring for why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the guy grew flowers in his
backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just got to stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: You called it, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those kids are doing time.
[SPEAKER_09]: As well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of kids doing time
through their parents, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: loved ones and opportunities are lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll never have, they never know,
you know, that confidence lost is that
[SPEAKER_06]: affects all throughout their lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it destroys, you know, it's,
it's sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen way too many of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad to see that at least there's
a ripple that's started and hopefully it
[SPEAKER_06]: will spread to other States and across
into other countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, congratulations for medical
marijuana, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that this week?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty a, I can't help, but felt that was
a little like Trump jab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't thought it was to be
really honest, but I think that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: countries, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways I think his presidency could
prove to be very positive because it will
[SPEAKER_02]: cause a lot of other presidents,
a lot of other powers that be to be
[SPEAKER_02]: proactive about what it is they don't like
and can't stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people are like, Oh,
they knew the consequences.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, listen, this isn't murder.
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't robbing a bank.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is growing a fucking flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is the consequences
shouldn't exist and civil disobedience
[SPEAKER_09]: until it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely must.
[SPEAKER_10]: The kids didn't grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, I couldn't, my mic fast enough
to say absolutely it must.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't blame the kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: The kids didn't grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: The kids are the victim of the,
the, the circumstances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the decisions of the adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had no say or no most, you know,
no planet in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just have to ride it out and are the
victims.
[SPEAKER_06]: They lost their parents, their parental
unit and you know, their stability.
[SPEAKER_06]: What they knew is their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about someone like forest who's grown
pot for his kids?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about someone like my mom who's given
me pot when I was nine?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of times the reason these
people are pushed to this is because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're trying to save their health of
their children.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've got no other risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got nothing else to lose.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've lost everything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last stance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at force, look at everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of us who have found cannabis,
it was almost like you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the last stance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mom finally was like, I mean,
how many cancers had you gone through
[SPEAKER_06]: seven to eight cancers by the time she
already decided to finally give you pot?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of, I might want to back that
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know you were really what you
were too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it to me earlier, honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now how, I mean, do you think she should
have given it to you at two?
[SPEAKER_02]: She, uh, well, now that I know about
edibles, but she wouldn't look,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were giving me fucking chemotherapy
and put me on radiation at age two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're, if you're able to give
me chemotherapy at four or five,
[SPEAKER_02]: six, why the hell can't I have pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wish she'd given it to me years
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't give it to me until I was nine
and I had it in soft tissue between my
[SPEAKER_02]: left lung and my heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only wish, but I'm glad she gave it to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to be honest, where would I be
without it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't know you and I'm glad I know
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry you went through it,
but like you said, you know, you hate that
[SPEAKER_06]: I went through war myself, but I'm glad I
went through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I met knew all of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, you know, sit there and wish any
illness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say this out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually am glad I went through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically, I've actually,
I, I caught a little slack for saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Jeff sessions are attorney general
would get cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd have a change of heart and you
know, and I'll say flat up, if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: kill you, it brings out compassion in
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings out empathy in people because
they experience the end of life and it
[SPEAKER_02]: changes your whole view on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really, really appreciative of the
fact that I went through cancer as a
[SPEAKER_02]: child.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really appreciative of the fact that I
had to face death and I learned about life
[SPEAKER_02]: and I learned about passion and honesty
and, and everything good in my life
[SPEAKER_02]: through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad I had cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I don't even feel bad when I
meet some people that have cancer because
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like something in life is going to
kill you anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made the comment to people,
it's better to die with your eyes open
[SPEAKER_02]: than to hit, get hit by a train and live
your entire life with your eyes closed,
[SPEAKER_02]: not even knowing they were closed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's heavy, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only someone that has lived through what
you lived through could really say that,
[SPEAKER_09]: have that perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a great perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: Life is, a lot of people walking through
life asleep, zombied right out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, even if it's right at the end of
life, if you can get awoken, if you can
[SPEAKER_09]: see a different perspective, there's real
value in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat that red pill.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all eaten, all on the panel here
have eaten the pill.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to think Sessions knows some
family members that have cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you got, you can't, I can't imagine
his entire family just like it's
[SPEAKER_09]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whose family doesn't have cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do you know what though?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he comes from a part of the deep
self where things are a little bit old
[SPEAKER_02]: fashioned and then realistically though,
a hard prejudices are hard to lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're dealing with some real ingrained
bigotry with these people going way,
[SPEAKER_02]: way, way, way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is that, and unless it's
his loved one or his daughter or somebody,
[SPEAKER_02]: and somehow his mind is opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, listen, you know, even if you watch
the DVD extras on the culture high and you
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to Danny's story, which is Dr.
Lester Grinspoon, talking about how
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant he was initially to giving his
son Danny cannabis when he had cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was his wife that went behind his
back, went to the schoolyard, hit up one
[SPEAKER_02]: of his friends, got him some pot and gave
it to him without Lester knowing,
[SPEAKER_02]: because Lester was worried about what
Harvard would think if they found out he
[SPEAKER_02]: was breaking the law and doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that so makes sense, Todd.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a perfect example too, because we
know that Lester is a loving, empathetic
[SPEAKER_09]: man.
[SPEAKER_09]: He is a good person, but the power of
worry, of prestige, of a position,
[SPEAKER_09]: of a doctorate degree, all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've met incredible doctors out there
who are terrified, not even forget about
[SPEAKER_09]: giving their son or their daughter
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're terrified to tell people that
cannabis can shrink a tumor.
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't even say it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a bad word.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, oh, oh no, we can't say
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you say that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't mean it always will.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact that it can means you should
be able to say it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're scared, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got a lot to lose, which is crazy,
because the person dying has a lot more to
[SPEAKER_09]: lose.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me say a shout out to Dr.
Brinspoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: He turned 89 years old yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, Lester.
[SPEAKER_06]: But doctors became the front line,
as stated before.
[SPEAKER_06]: When Prop 215 passed, they went after the
doctors, and the doctors had to physically
[SPEAKER_06]: band together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually push back against the
prosecution of the federal prosecutor at
[SPEAKER_06]: the time, or the head of the drug czar
even was coming out and publicly shaming
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were taking that type of ribbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's huge when you have
literally the top lawmakers in the country
[SPEAKER_06]: shitting on you in the national media that
goes out back when the press secretary and
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody all went in one location and got
debriefed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they actually really tried to
destroy their careers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually used Todd McCarey's
slides and put his quotes on CNN.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was our drug czar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was his name at the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Barry McCaffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came out and publicly went out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually came out and named Dr. Todd
McCarey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, at the time in the 90s,
there was a handful of these people that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could point to all over the country
that were actually vocal advocates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing books and calling for change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, literally, I could rattle their
names off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, a lot of them have
passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Dr. John Morgan, who wrote Marijuana
Facts, who was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Todd McCarey, who the CMA,
California Medical Association,
[SPEAKER_02]: went after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Round 215, because he was one of the most
vocal advocates that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of our first whistleblowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody listening to this should look up
his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: T-O-D with one D and it's M-I-K-U-R-I-Y-A
is how you spell McCarey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is one of the pioneers in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't for him and Dr. Lester
Grinspoon, I don't know what it would have
[SPEAKER_02]: looked like in the 70s and 80s trying to
get information about medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And fortunately, they led to then my
doctor, Dr. Frank Lucido, who in Berkeley
[SPEAKER_06]: became a predominant one and actually
joined in suit with Todd McCarey against
[SPEAKER_06]: the feds to actually win the right for
doctors to be able to continue to have
[SPEAKER_06]: that confidentiality between a patient and
doctor to discuss your medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that still goes on today as each one
of these new states go on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now enlists the challenges and the fears
of now doctors to write the prescriptions,
[SPEAKER_06]: because those earlier ones that write a
lot of prescriptions, like Dr. Todd
[SPEAKER_06]: McCarey, who had CMA, those state medical
boards come after you and are vindictive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it requires strength of the educated
then in those states to actually ride that
[SPEAKER_06]: pine, to actually skate on that razor's
edge, to win that right for everyone
[SPEAKER_06]: still.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's happening with each state's
succession, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Vindictive, another word for
endocannabinoid deficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So true.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't even, I smoke so much cannabis
and I've had people do me so wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just like, I wish the best for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want them, I don't want them to
have suffering.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want them to, you know,
I just, vindictive is such a strange
[SPEAKER_09]: energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the energy that if you use
cannabis on a daily basis that you want to
[SPEAKER_09]: feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But those medical boards are nothing but
those strict run the line, line followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just say this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because Dr. Todd and guys like,
um, what they were such a threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's really the reality of
it is they knew the information they were
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting was true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not something they could debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the easiest thing to do is to attack
the person presenting the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did, you know, I was going to say
doc, uh, Dr. William Eidleman,
[SPEAKER_02]: who was one of Jack, her is earliest other
than Dr. Micaria recruits into the
[SPEAKER_02]: activism game is still an activist today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he put his medical license on the line
to advocate medical cannabis after meeting
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was really a hero.
[SPEAKER_02]: He still is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great guy out of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always had so much respect for
him, but the California medical
[SPEAKER_02]: association tried to revoke his medical
license over his stance on medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he fought them tooth and nail thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they love to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just talking with Dr. David Allen
right now, who's also been through some,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, similar things with his license,
uh, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've invited him on.
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't have the right computer.
[SPEAKER_09]: He says he has an Apple phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, if you can figure it out and put
your phone down, so you're not moving
[SPEAKER_09]: around, we would love to have you on for
discussion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alec is also going to be at his lab in
about five minutes and, uh, from SC labs
[SPEAKER_09]: and he'll be coming in in the next 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a feeling our conversation is
going to get a little scientific here in
[SPEAKER_09]: the near future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great to hear from a doctor's
perspective, you know, because to hear
[SPEAKER_06]: from, you know, their educated standpoint
regarding all the different fears that
[SPEAKER_06]: they have to actually face, you know,
from going through school, from doing
[SPEAKER_06]: their actual, you know, I know students
that, uh, actually, uh, have become,
[SPEAKER_06]: gone on to become doctors that they took a
very great risk by choosing to,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, you know, research cannabis,
uh, as their thesis all the way through
[SPEAKER_06]: their doctorates and were very successful
in doing so.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they had to actually
physically take a risk because that was
[SPEAKER_06]: their financing, whether their,
uh, professors would accept or reject it
[SPEAKER_06]: or anywhere along the line to where they
got their, you know, doctor certification,
[SPEAKER_06]: much less when you step out into the real
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's risks all along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really want to come out and be one
of those that are spoken out regarding
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I want to say something
because somebody wrote in the chat on the
[SPEAKER_02]: video the other day that, you know,
I was crazy if I didn't think that people
[SPEAKER_02]: were still getting the doors kicked in
and, and getting raided and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me tell you something,
I am all too aware of what's happening
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere else in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really still, one of the reasons I
hope that we do the show and that more
[SPEAKER_02]: information gets out is because I hope
people see the normalization of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening here in California and in
Colorado and in Washington and in other
[SPEAKER_02]: places like Oregon and, and demand that
happened where they live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that our stories inspire people in
places that aren't yet legal to take the
[SPEAKER_02]: step forward and go engage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, I'm not saying go to
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying, you know, go compromise
your families, but I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't be afraid anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have so much in the information behind
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, use your smartphone,
get educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like me don't have to go to places
like Kinko's to hand you copies of a book
[SPEAKER_02]: that is expensive and hard to get anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go on your phone and read every
single chapter of Jack Harris book.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes free on
jackhera.com if you want to and get
[SPEAKER_02]: inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I, and I implore people to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they meet their politicians,
don't let them escape the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're carrying a smartphone because
you're stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're carrying a smartphone and you
don't know how to look stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the word ham hit enter, go to the
Wikipedia and start learning some history
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is all of our history.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is connected to all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what color, what race,
what country you came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has a connection to you and you
need to learn it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Dr. David Allen just wrote me a
message saying the California medical
[SPEAKER_09]: board targeted him because the drug task
force called the medical board in
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess that was where he was,
where he had his problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was in Maryland or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was definitely not in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was like out East somewhere
that he originally had his problems with
[SPEAKER_09]: the drug force.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, this is going to happen
state to state.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to happen because there,
there is institutionalized bureaucratic
[SPEAKER_02]: bigotry that we are dealing with all the
way across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every single state in this union that
legalizes is going to be dealing with some
[SPEAKER_02]: jerk along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to resist, resist, resist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what's fortunate for us
though, is that we gain momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we get more numbers behind us and
we get more wins behind us and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: more information around us, it's easier
for us to overcome the people that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: our way with misinformation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff from Aqua lab says the cops came into
our grow two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just walked out, got in my car and drove
away.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the cops did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you came back and had your plans
bro is what I hope.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're okay, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope all is well with everything down
there for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me say this though, even if this is
the beauty of California right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a story that it doesn't matter
if it's two or 2000, it should have been
[SPEAKER_02]: seven or 7,000 because any number over the
six plant limit is only being charged as a
[SPEAKER_02]: misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could go grow 4,000 pop plants,
4,116 pop plants in your Bel Air home and
[SPEAKER_02]: the state of California can only charge
you with misdemeanor manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're still going to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they're going to call it
cultivation yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they've learned that it's a
plant quite yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't seem so because the absurdity
of what they're trying to do would just be
[SPEAKER_09]: so unveiled if they actually had the
realization that it was like, like what
[SPEAKER_09]: you said, many shows ago, these people are
habitual florists, like habitual florists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of how absurd that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love growing flowers and plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, though, can I say straight up
and John will probably totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone who grows understands and you
know, I was lucky to learn how to grow pot
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was 13 years old because it taught
me the cycle of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught me how to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught me how to use nutrients and
think about what I was feeding a living
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in my life, which taught me how to
feed myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught me the value of pH and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught me actually how to not care too
much for something and to let it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, growing cannabis was the best life
lesson I could have ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I've said this to a lot of
people, I was lucky to be growing pot at
[SPEAKER_02]: 13, 14, 15, 16 because Mother Nature
looking over my shoulder always,
[SPEAKER_02]: always rewarded me for my efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning if I grew an extra hundred plants,
I got an extra hundred plants worth of
[SPEAKER_02]: energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my friends on the other hand,
who were working minimum wage and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: doing minimum amounts of work for that
minimum wage in return for getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: least amount of money they could get paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the least amount of work they
could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, I, on the other hand was learning
how to like work hard and apply myself and
[SPEAKER_02]: to like throw in all my effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I knew I would be rewarded if this
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas my friends at work, they could
bust ass for three months, go to their
[SPEAKER_02]: boss, ask for a raise and get laughed at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a fucked up lesson to be
learning when you're 16, 17, 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead having gardening actually
taught me a very different lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taught me how to wake up early and to work
hard and fucking stay at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good to be thankful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's going on Alec?
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you've made it to your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up Marcus?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Setting the phone down, getting it all
sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been somewhat unreliable in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Tim on last Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we saw the website on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we figure we wait and ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, last weekend for what it's
worth, I had just the day before I got
[SPEAKER_00]: back from a 16 day whitewater rafting trip
down the Grand Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and when I got back, I didn't
have my internet in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, I meant the show was the
canceled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The country fair was canceled.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we wanted to talk about the contest
in the way you divided up the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously now you have some
information about the show not happening
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just making a shitty excuse for
why I wasn't able to make it last weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but anyway, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, um, yeah, we're really excited
about cannabis country fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we were about to do a real
cool kind of, uh, uh, interesting way of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of, um, you know, basically having the
judging process take place, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking into account kind of chemotypic
profiles a little bit more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and just trying to celebrate a
lot more of the diversity of what cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has to offer, you know, um, through this
new type of judging that we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: try out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so for what it's worth,
you know, that, you know, they were going,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, full, full bore and, uh, they had
some, uh, a really, um, really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: big production team, um, backing them to
help kind of make this event happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it's, it's,
it's interesting because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just with as many events as there are now,
and as much as ever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are holding events and doing
promotions are, are vying for people's
[SPEAKER_00]: attention throughout the summer to try to
come to these different events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, when they, they just kind of
saw, I think some early signs and early
[SPEAKER_00]: red flags on, on, you know, it possibly
not getting, you know, the type of turnout
[SPEAKER_00]: they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, just, uh, kind of the,
the full moon eclipse kind of symbiosis
[SPEAKER_00]: event happening soon after that with,
you know, and that, that is kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the summer, you know,
that's like sold out and kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, tens of thousands of people,
I think in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The logistics of doing it around other
events has to be considered earlier on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they weren't, it's definitely a
reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're talking a pretty
remote drive for most people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're cracking up on us, Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something, something just blew with your
mic.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a, that sounds like
something actually blew, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't hear us.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, we can't hear you anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meet that mic for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went crackly, crackly bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crackly, crackly, crackly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: His audio just went pooched.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think you're okay now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was like a weird feedback or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, another thing I was going to say
is probably, he had mentioned a serious
[SPEAKER_09]: production company that he had gotten into
partnership with for this project.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kind of got the idea that it was
them that looked at it and said,
[SPEAKER_09]: listen, like, we just can't, we're not
going to be able to get all this happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, I think they're,
um, some of their insights kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, on some of the red,
early red flags were kind of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think, yeah, the really big
indicators that kind of Tim took to heart
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but yeah, I mean,
it's, uh, for what it's worth though,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's, uh, it's funny because,
you know, the Emerald Cup has become such
[SPEAKER_00]: a, you know, logistical, just like,
it's, it's the, you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest kind of, um, you know,
influxes of samples that we ever see at
[SPEAKER_00]: our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of each year, now that we've
been doing it for the last seven years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we've, uh, we've, we've tried to
put together a team to a lot more early on
[SPEAKER_00]: in the year, you know, kind of help to
really work out the, the logistics and
[SPEAKER_00]: how, you know, the deadlines and the in
sample intake and stuff like that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go, you know, to avoid this huge
kind of collision nightmare that can,
[SPEAKER_00]: that very often happens, you know,
especially when the, the Emerald Cup kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sampled, you know, total amount of
entries kind of has gone up from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, five years ago around 100,
150 to, you know, each year almost
[SPEAKER_00]: doubling, you know, and last year with all
the categories combined, it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say there's like 1300 entries
and 800 of them came in in the last like
[SPEAKER_00]: two days or three days, which is after Tim
had pushed and extended the deadline,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to include more people because
there was a lot of people up in arms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so unfortunately the Emerald Cup is
happening this year, but can you wrap a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you were involved in the thought
process that broke the contest into a new,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new kind of contest and turned it into
these five different terpene categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really would love for you to talk
about why you selected those five terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and also what those, those five terpenes
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also as a lab, are you, are you just
using spikes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, could you explain the little
process a little bit, talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I find it so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, you know, for the last
nine or 10 months here at SCU Labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been working with a data scientist,
a gentleman by the name Stelios,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's a Greek dude from out, he,
he used to do a little bit of work with
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegocam and, and Arno, you know,
kind of, you know, attempting to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, look at their chemometric data
and kind of identify trends and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, interesting kind of,
you know, aspects of their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, so, you know, we started
working with him because we, we have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpene data that we wanted to
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like look into and so, and I think I
might've potentially mentioned this before
[SPEAKER_00]: on here, but we basically set out to
create a terpene classification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when, when we came into it,
we didn't really know what we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find or see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, after nine months and a lot
of back and forth kind of working with
[SPEAKER_00]: this data scientist to kind of fine tune
this, these different statistic data
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, he was using things like PLSDA
with, which is like partial least mean
[SPEAKER_00]: square analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say, if I'm not mistaken,
and then like certain types of clustering
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithms like, or clustering tools like
k-means, k-means clustering, artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: neural networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to use a combination of these
different tools to kind of develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: novel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just got bumpy de-boomed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost thought for a second,
I accidentally, here's a funny thing
[SPEAKER_09]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm typing and having off-screen
conversations and my cursor's on the chat
[SPEAKER_09]: room here in the Google chat, it will,
it could, it could dump people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome back, Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alec, I almost thought I bumped you out
there, but I see you just left by
[SPEAKER_09]: accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it just dumped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just got an error on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, anyway, if there was a way you
could send me to Google hangout to a link
[SPEAKER_00]: to my email, I'm going to try to shift
from my phone to my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'd be a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: You tell me the email.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alec at SC labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: S-C-L-A-B-S dot com and A-L-E-C.
[SPEAKER_08]: L-A-B-S-A-L-E-C.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't know where I fell off
there, but essentially we've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last nine or 10 months now to
basically sort through and cluster our
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene data in an effort to create a
terpene class system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've found is really interesting
in that with about 95 plus percent
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy and predictability, we can
essentially send any terpene report that
[SPEAKER_00]: we test of any strain that comes across
our labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it fits very interestingly into one of
essentially about four major primary
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets or clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within each of the primary groups
or clusters, there's an additional between
[SPEAKER_00]: two to three subgroups that any strain
that we pass into it essentially very
[SPEAKER_00]: predictably falls into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about the system is
it's very intuitive if you know the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of on one spectrum of this
class system, you have terpene as this
[SPEAKER_00]: primary terpene that from the clustering
is either there in pretty significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts or it's not at all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpene is the dominant primary
terpene in such a range of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, sativa stimulating strains that we
know like jacarera, trainwreck,
[SPEAKER_00]: Durbin, sage, Dutch treat, a lot of the
Hawaiian stuff that is around or still
[SPEAKER_00]: barely around, but a lot of those XJ,
J1, you know that those strains all smell
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different from one another,
but yet they're more closely related in
[SPEAKER_00]: similarity than trying to compare that to
say sour diesel, which in sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know kind of intuitively from the
smell that it shares probably more in
[SPEAKER_00]: common with say cam dog and gorilla glue
and you know OGs and such, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: although there are still slight variations
and differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the OG group is one of the
hardest groups to get your full grasp on
[SPEAKER_00]: because instead of one primary terpene,
you're typically making up the brunt of
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG is like almost the most or this fuel
group is almost the, it's almost the best
[SPEAKER_00]: version I would think of like what a
hybrid kind of terpene spectrum would look
[SPEAKER_00]: like because it's not one primary terpene,
it's like three to five terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always predictably limenine,
myrcine, beta-caroferline typically at
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like co-dominant amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the phenome, it can
slightly shift to become more limenine
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant or myrcine dominant or
beta-caroferline dominant, but those
[SPEAKER_00]: differences are enough to make up,
you know, the differences between say Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies and you know, because Girl
Scout cookies is a beta-caroferline
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant strain cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beta-caroferline, so it shares
similar to say like cam dog and sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel, it is beta-caroferline,
though all those strains are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: more beta-caroferline dominant,
but in the gorilla glues and sour dies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the beta-caroferline will just be slightly
higher say than the co-dominant myrcine or
[SPEAKER_00]: limenine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to Girl Scout cookies or some,
you know, or strains similar, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be appreciably higher in
beta-caroferline compared to the limenine
[SPEAKER_00]: myrcine, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this gas or fuel kind of group,
you know, you seem to have this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shifting range of, you know, the primary
terpene either from like limenine to
[SPEAKER_00]: myrcine to beta-caroferline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secondary terpenes in that group are
typically linalool and humuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so that's kind of one group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, on the far other side
of the spectrum is, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: classical myrcine group, you know,
which, you know, is the biggest group
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, of all the strains of
cannabis we test, you know, myrcine and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the fuel groups are the most
populated groups that we see and find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the myrcine group, you know,
everything, all the fruity type strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of tangy, Agent O,
Orange, you know, kind of Cali O,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those classic type that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in that same group,
you also have all the purples,
[SPEAKER_00]: purple or GDP, Grape Ape, you know,
all those types of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the differences between those two
groups, like the, you know, from what we
[SPEAKER_00]: see, the tangies and a lot of those
strains are in the same primary group as
[SPEAKER_00]: the purples and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference between the two is like
a sub grouping, where the beta carotene
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, maybe a third of the total
strain, as opposed to the myrcine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the primary terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, when you look at the
tangies and, you know, even things like
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream and stuff like that,
it's typically really, really high
[SPEAKER_00]: myrcine, very low everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's like alpha pining or some
other terpene that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some small secondary amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the relationship between the
primary and secondary terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which typically, and you know,
we test for 30 something terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see about five to nine terpenes
ever really show up in any significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, you know, and, you know,
the really cool thing about the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, is, you know, we have like an outlier
flag, you know, so if something passes
[SPEAKER_00]: through that is, you know, significantly
off the norm, you know, it's flagged as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of not able to fit into any of these
primary secondary or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: primary groupings or, you know,
these, you know, sub groupings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so so through that, you know,
we've been able to identify very
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating novelty that's that's,
you know, created and entered through,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, the Emerald Cup, like last year,
you know, group called true humble,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of big farm kind of co op
type group up in Humboldt Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a strain that sent in,
which is actually for what it's worth,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was an in the pines cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the pines is, you know,
is this pineapple type smell strain that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, has has historically had had
high placements and has won the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup in a certain year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and certain, a certain Fino,
it was crossed with Royal Cush called it
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal Pines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Royal Pines strain was dominant
in Ossamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ossamine is a really fascinating,
interesting terpene that we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: ever see in any significant amounts except
as a as this as a secondary terpene that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you know, because so in this nursing
group, and I'm sorry, I'm kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this nursing group, you know,
you have this one group where it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: high nursing, very low everything else
kind of like, tangy, a lot of typical kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, you know, fruit smelling strains,
blueberry, a lot of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have this other sub group where
it's like higher in beta carofaline as a
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all of a sudden makes up all the
purples, you know, and then you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this other sub group in the
nursing primary group that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary terpene is Ossamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ossamine is O-C-I-M-E-N-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also when whenever Ossamine is
high in a strain that all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it, you know, it fall into this
group that is like Green Crack,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream Queen, Papaya, Mango, you know,
those, you know, you know, that smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, it's a distinct kind of,
but those strains smell similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, same thing as like Super Skunk
if you've seen Super Skunk, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so it's so Ossamine whenever it
shows is typically secondary, but less,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, typically 50% or less the
primary terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so all of a sudden now through
this outlier kind of flag, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we identified in the pines cross that was
now dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And primary in Ossamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, you know, we thought that was
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen kind of a foreign y'all
dominant like Siberian Ruderalis strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that might, one of my buddies calls it
bacon that he's been breeding for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about the
classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making terpene groupings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are these terpenes based on their
ability to potentiate or to modify the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of the other cannabinoids or are
they just because they're there on the GC?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so pretty much, I mean,
there's no, there's no kind of combined or
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced like entourage, you know,
effects, you know, to it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because essentially all we're doing is
taking the raw, you know, terpene data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I understand exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess what I'm saying is that most
of the terpenes you're talking about are
[SPEAKER_01]: potentiating and modifying THC,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mersene certainly does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limelene certainly does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinene does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And linalal to a certain degree certainly
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But karyophylline does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't particularly potentiate or
modify recreational effects of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: although maybe for medical uses,
there might be all kinds of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because beta karyophylline is the one
terpene known to bind to CB2 as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I think it's really
interesting because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you vaporize it with THC and
pure karyophylline, it doesn't potentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: or modify the THC effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these kind of things to tease
out are some of the most interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things that can be found to help
anecdotally add to people's experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: take away some of the suggestive selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whenever a patient goes into a
dispensary or a consumer goes into a rec
[SPEAKER_00]: shop and they're looking for a strain and
they know very little to nothing about,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, cannabis or the nuances of these
different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking for some effect,
so much depending on their metabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: their user experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, their food intake that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different kind of nuances
about how a strain is going to help affect
[SPEAKER_00]: one person versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then further, you know, there's the
whole idea of like biphasic activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just throws a whole nother like,
you know, crazy aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're hoping with this system is,
you know, because when you go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: collective or dispensary and there's,
you know, 50 to 100 mason jars on shelves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's almost, you know,
incredibly unapproachable for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your system at your website or online?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's, I mean, we're just kind of
now working on kind of the graphic front
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the whole program.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've of course seen Mr. Lewis's Napro
system, yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point is the one that I like the
best until somebody makes a better one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, they've definitely
done a lot of work to kind of add
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of, you know,
an algorithm to take and combine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, data about the entourage effect
to help kind of suggest what the strain is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make you feel or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so I definitely think
that's at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did a test with double blind
patients, we found that people all agreed
[SPEAKER_01]: on the type of effects they were getting
from, say, THC with one particular
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all had their differences and
preferences to which ones they liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but they all agreed that it had
a similar effect with each other.
What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's say they smoked 25 milligrams
of or vaped 25 milligrams of THC with a
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny spike of limaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all said it was stimulating,
uplifting, you know, whereas Mircein in
[SPEAKER_01]: large amounts, they would say would be
more couch locky, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's and that's the I think
such fascinating kind of insights that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can gain also from just the anecdotal user
response that, you know, people have
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally kind of, you know, found in
certain strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so adding, I think,
this level of specific terpene kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: data to help empower people's user
experience or, you know, kind of Bud
[SPEAKER_00]: Tender's understanding of the smell of
cannabis to help make recommendations,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is, you know, one of the coolest
things that we could help do with kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the data that we.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the cannabinoid level and
the terpene profile levels, then in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future, people will be able to make a very
educated guess on the type of effects even
[SPEAKER_01]: before they try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, because especially
too with terpene, like what I would ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually ask you your thoughts on
terpene, just terpene, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from all the literature is, you know,
when vaporized is suggested to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: sedative, you know, but but on contrary to
that, what's really interesting is most
[SPEAKER_00]: user experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, I've never vaped it by itself
or with pure THC, like I did with the
[SPEAKER_01]: other the other maybe top dozen terpenes I
did try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, yeah, because terpenaline,
you know, is this primary terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, again, and all these like really
typical quote kind of sativa strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, think that affect with
with trainwreck and Durbin and Sage Zeta,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so so I wonder if kind
of, you know, the literature out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that suggests that terpenaline when vaped
is a sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that somehow has something to
do with the pythagoric effect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mersene is reported to be that way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a small amount of Mersene,
it's stimulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a lot of Mersene, it's
couch-locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit biphasic, the way cannabis
in itself is in general, where at first it
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulates and then it depresses to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, so that's and I think it's
really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, also just kind of what
you're talking about with
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-caryophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wonder how, you know,
so so sure beta-caryophylline and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying, you know, might not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried beta-caryophylline and THC and it
didn't help it in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also tried barry-caryophylline oxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder I wonder, you know,
if you had Crohn's or irritable bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome or colitis or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a really healthy guy who just smokes
because I like to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point you're making is that a lot
of terpenes do have medicinal or or.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I was going to ask this
question is what are some in both to Sam
[SPEAKER_02]: and Alex, what are some of the most
beneficial terpenes that are found in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and what do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, it's the most common ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, mersene, limoline, pining,
linalal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were mentioned some of the other
ones like guaiol and niraval.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really see those very in very
significant amounts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or very large amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about awesomine?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never made awesomine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk about it other than I know
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's a question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that is that, you know, OK,
there's going to be dominant terpenes,
[SPEAKER_09]: certainly.
[SPEAKER_09]: But are we going to learn the importance
of these secondary terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_09]: effects they have on the dominant terpenes
and just a tiny little bit being present?
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I think that's I think that's
an incredibly good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when throughout the process,
you know, we've been trying to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this further and kind of,
you know, one of my partners, Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: has kind of made this interesting kind of,
you know, kind of comparison to spices,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because it's like you take,
you know, a dash of salt and throw it into
[SPEAKER_00]: a soup, you know, barely affect the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take the same, you know,
kind of dash and throw up like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cumin or something, you just
made cumin soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so it's like the presence of
certain terpenes might, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially be, you know, these minor
terpenes that are there in various,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, almost what seems
inconsequential, you know, might be
[SPEAKER_00]: actually having pretty substantial
effects, you know, but but whenever you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, you know, kind of hundreds of
these terpene reports and you see kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these dominant terpenes pop up,
you know, it's it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's clear that, you know, there's these,
yeah, like, just like Sam was just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning, you know, these, you know,
what we see is about five to nine
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, like the major ones exactly are
myrcine, beta carotene, limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, myrcine, mango hops,
you know, the sedative effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, beta carotene, pepper,
clove, you know, CB2, receptor agonist,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, so and then which gets
into the whole idea of kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also to what we found was that wide leaf
drug varieties in general have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: suite than narrow leaf drug varieties,
which have a different suite than hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, which have a different suite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all the same terpenes,
150 or so have been identified in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but they they tend towards
certain terpenes in certain widely narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf and hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's what's interesting
because you see you see certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: clustered together where, you know,
and then I was bringing up earlier the
[SPEAKER_00]: example of terpenoline, you know,
you see, you don't usually see in any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other groups, like the primary groups,
there's the pining group, there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: myrcine group, there's the kind of
combination limonene, myrcine,
[SPEAKER_00]: beta carotene group, and then there's the
terpenoline group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the terpenoline group, it's either
kind of there or it's not there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and certain times you'll see it
in some myrcine dominant strains in a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, but it's, you know, certain
terpenes seem to cluster together too
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever, you know, and to have that might
have the potential to grow off certain
[SPEAKER_00]: widely drug type or narrow leaf drug type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll be more than one
classification system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be one based on frequency or
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll also be one for ability
to potentiate or modify in a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think that's some of the
most interesting ways to use the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: classification system is to have an effect
on breeding potentials, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and to be able to combine,
you know, fascinating terpenes that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really ever show up and, you know,
with, with other terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that, you know, like, and,
and I think, you know, also means a great
[SPEAKER_00]: example of that because the awesome mean
what we see, it's either, it either shows
[SPEAKER_00]: up as a secondary tertiary terpene in this
myrcine primary group, which is on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one side of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's like a dream queen green
crag, like kind of a papaya mango,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those types of smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a quick question here.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can, if I can add before I got to
jump off, I got to check out of a hotel
[SPEAKER_05]: here, but I just wanted to add two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I think it's great what
you're doing, but always comparing flower
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles to, to extract profiles,
I think is a very useful thing to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand the impact that the extraction
process has on manipulating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of these terpenes that you
mentioned are not thermally stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you stare at them crosswise
cross-eyed, they do different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what would be really interesting to
actually correlate would be not only from
[SPEAKER_05]: the flower to the extract, but also what
happens at nail temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were to actually do a headspace
GC measurement, uh, a, uh, of an extract
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a myrcine dominant, I will bet you
a dollar to a donut that at nail
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature, that myrcine does all kinds
of different chemistry to actually make
[SPEAKER_05]: other terpenes or terpenoids from just
oxidation on the nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're going to do this,
Mark, then we should also get a sample
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh bud and GC for terpenes,
dry bud, and then extract all from the
[SPEAKER_01]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam, I'm in, I'm in the process of doing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to put together a dataset
that I could share that actually chemistry
[SPEAKER_05]: is happening, you know, based on your,
um, uh, anecdotal, uh, results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey folks, I got to jump.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, uh, people are telling me we got to
check out of our room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will see you guys next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for coming on Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just off the coast of Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to know tons of people that hid
their money there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Mark's point, you know, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we have seen a, a fascinating
kind of trend in extracts and that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: typically most to all extracts are
beta-carotene dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so many cases it seems like,
yeah, you have the, the mono terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: boil off at lower temperatures seem to go
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and again, so, so those are the
more precious, delicate ones that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that also contributes to the
substantial, you know, majority of most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the pursuit or effort to
maximize your preservation of the cured
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene, you know, potential that could be
there and how much total terpene potential
[SPEAKER_00]: could be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems like, you know,
yeah, the, you know, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody always knew that,
you know, the heat and the purging and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of all the curing process is,
is kind of such a huge way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you looked at the, uh, amount of
terpene that a fresh bud, a lot of live
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh bud has versus a dried one versus a
manicured process one versus extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done that with the exact same
plant material to try to understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I always assume more than 75% of
the terpenes are lost from a fresh plant
[SPEAKER_01]: when you dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just by, just by smelling the
terpenes in the air of like a final,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, flowering room that's about to
be harvested, it means that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling off and you're, you know,
they're getting into your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I think, yeah, everything you
do from the moment, you know, throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivation cycle and the,
the, the levels of heat, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you allow your room to get up to,
I think, you know, from the get-go are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a huge effect on,
on, you know, the overall loss in terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then yeah, it's like, um,
I mean, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you what a terpene, what a
terpene samples like in water half Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, you know, so, so, so what we,
what we typically see is in extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, across the board, you know,
like typically between three, we see about
[SPEAKER_00]: three, you know, one to 3% of the,
you know, total terpene content in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the, in an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if, you know, it's, you know,
and if from both water and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, other types of
processes, whenever plant, whenever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that material has been
exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you know, with, with care
to, to, you know, and it's really good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, low temperatures are
used to heat purge, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we see, you know,
put, you know, certain, certain types of
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, you know, up to five to 9% total
terpene content, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's these terpies, super terpene rich
processes that, you know, we see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like holy water and these
different like terpene fraction type
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, you know, we see kind of get up
to anywhere from, you know, 12 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they get to the point
where they're just like very running this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I always thought those people
are actually adding food grade terpenes to
[SPEAKER_02]: their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be very easy for them to do
so, especially when they're getting to
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you know, triple that of a flower
number of their overall terpene in an
[SPEAKER_02]: extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially when you consider what
you're talking about, that almost any
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent across the board, don't matter if
it's water, CO2, butane, propane washes
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes down, period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's either they're not purging it
or they're amplifying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if they're doing it from a base of
cannabis and they're getting four times as
[SPEAKER_02]: much terpenes that were found in the
cannabis, I suspect bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, this is also then my next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What terpenes have you found that are
hazardous that people shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, just real quick to what
you were saying, you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I have seen both with,
both done with CO2 and with butane,
[SPEAKER_00]: a type of product, you know, that,
that's just, you know, kind of called
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes like holy water or like turp
juice and nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there, it's a, it's a,
it's a type of process, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and, and is, you know,
not adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think that's really
fascinating, you know, in the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of however they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and typically in that type of
extract, you know, the cannabinoids aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 40 to 50% overall cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, kind of up to,
you know, 15 plus percent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, you know, what have you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think all plants aren't created
equally.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, some plants are one to 2%
terpene content.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are ones that are four and five,
and there are maybe the odd few anomaly
[SPEAKER_09]: out there that are close to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are 10, they were created by man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bred.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But imagine taking, imagine taking a 10,
imagine taking a 10% or a nine or an eight
[SPEAKER_09]: and creating an extract with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're probably going to get a higher
return in the terpenes than say your buddy
[SPEAKER_09]: who's using the one to three.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And processing is losing a lot because if
you've got a couple percent terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: you make the and it's 20% THC by dry
weight for plant material, then that means
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have 8% when you've got pretty
much pure product made, an extract made
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not, it never is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you say you've seen a few people who
have done it, who are especially trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: capture terpenes and they're using really
low temperatures, and specialized methods.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to throw this out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have been fortunate enough to
be the photographer for Chalice for two
[SPEAKER_02]: years in a row and for the secret cup for
a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have seen a shit ton of really
beautiful, super incredibly well done
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts that were not adulterated and
that were super terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no disrespect to any of those guys
when I say this, but they'll say it too,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they know a lot of people aren't
really doing it like they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of people trying to
adulterate really low par stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So buyer beware is, I guess, part of my
message.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's, there is both sides of
the fence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, what I think we see that's
really fascinating about your point,
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd, is like, you know, you know,
you kind of, I mean, I think there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people that test with us to basically
like they think they're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have this business plan in their mind
where they're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we figured out short path and we're going
to like, you know, spin shit into gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and they see this huge
margin kind of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you know, and then,
you know, come to the realization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much intricacies to
that, just the distillation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people are just, you know,
destroying so much of the THC creating
[SPEAKER_00]: like Delta eight and other kind of like
breakdown isomer, like kind of almost junk
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, you know, and then wondering
where all THC is, but that's process,
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, I mean, it's just such
a heat intensive process to, to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to distill and create 95% Delta nine THC,
you know, which, you know, it was often
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult process, you know,
and, and so people then will, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of have this kind of essentially
single, it's just kind of like a single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule isolated distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they think that
they're gonna go test, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, a bunch of most popular strains
on the shelves, and then recreate these
[SPEAKER_00]: turf profiles based off the test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in zero cases, I would say it's ever
worked whenever had any success,
[SPEAKER_09]: which further enforces the theory further
enforces the theory that potentially these
[SPEAKER_09]: very small amounts, the secondary and
maybe even tertiary classes of terpenes
[SPEAKER_09]: are having a deeper effect than we
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's totally the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also these, the fact that there's
these alcohol esters and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different potential kind of flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and it just, it just seems
like it's such a, you know, amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: complex matrix of, of terpenes,
cannabinoids, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's almost un,
unpharmaceuticalizable in that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, where you can just like make
a mixture and go again, add these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, sedentically back, whatever,
get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, because, because for what I
ended up telling a lot of the clients that
[SPEAKER_00]: we work with that are doing that,
I'm like, dude, a lot, all this kind of R
[SPEAKER_00]: &D you're doing is almost, it's almost a
waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're going to take,
if you're going to try to add terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: back, you either are going to create,
you know, for the connoisseur kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: flavour market where you're actually like
taking distilled off, like the almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Blue River and Tony and
like, you know, Mark, you guys are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: such awesome work in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like natural extracts of like perfect,
you know, preserved terpenes off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then being able to add them as
the dilutants, you know, to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge with distillate, all of a sudden
makes that cartridge taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or if you combine those terpenes with
any, you know, kind of crude cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that you're going to make into a
vape and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but for the people that are doing,
trying to take Limonene, Miracin beta
[SPEAKER_00]: carotene blended in certain amounts to
re-add, I mean, I think it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous road to go down because for one,
all these terpenes, you know, aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really known, like, you know, the,
I mean, there's these, these aspects to
[SPEAKER_00]: like toxicity and how much you're adding
of any one of them, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you might be substantially
deviating from what cannabis would ever
[SPEAKER_00]: produce of these certain terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then, so, so what I tell
people is like, I'm like, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to, if you're going to try to recreate a
profile, you know, you're failing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should just go full banana or,
you know, go full watermelon, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like strawberry lemonade, you know,
it's like, if you're going to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go full for it, you know,
and you know, cause there is some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market that's going to, you know,
possibly be interested in that because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole vape community and everybody
just like, you know, shooting clouds of
[SPEAKER_00]: these crazy, like PGVG, like flavor
blends, you know, and I don't think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't necessarily think,
I mean, there, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot not known about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can ask you, what are those things?
[SPEAKER_02]: From a, from a scientific standpoint,
what the hell are those strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: watermelon bubble gun flavors,
may I ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use them, so I'm totally clueless
as to what they are, but I'm asking you,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they vaporizing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not, I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I think maybe, I don't know
if Sam or somebody might be able to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: more to that, but I mean, yeah,
there are a lot of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, mixtures of compounds that,
you know, probably pretty hard to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: enunciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a lot of flavoring,
preservative, you know, there's just a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of crazy stuff in these, in these,
in these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and yeah, and, and whether it's like
a low temp that you're hitting it or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dabbing it, or whether it's up to,
you know, like, scald and hot nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, it's like, what are the
range of compounds that are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into other compounds when you're
lighting them to these heats, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these different levels of heat,
because yeah, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things might be, you know,
turning, you know, I mean, like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the big,
ugly things of the vape industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, burning or vaping PG and
VG all day long, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're doing that, you know,
at these different temperatures and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're very well creating other
types of very harmful toxic compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like formaldehyde and other types of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, is that any better for
you long-term in your chronic exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: than, you know, nicotine or what have you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Not, not nicotine, but definitely like
radioactive nucleotides that they spray on
[SPEAKER_09]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have to say that that shit is so
bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the, that's the comparison.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why this, this glycol or whatever
it is that people are clouding out on is
[SPEAKER_09]: so nasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: But people like, Oh, it's still way better
than cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, Oh my God, like, yeah,
but cigarettes are radioactive.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a good comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and so, so, so I think,
uh, you know, in the, in the idea of do no
[SPEAKER_00]: harm, you know, and try to represent the
cannabis plant to the highest of its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential integrity, you know,
it's like, you know, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people should just, you have both from a
consumer and buyer standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from people producing products,
it's like, should like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: step carefully in like the directions and
really think them through and identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the potential, you know,
hazards because yeah, it's, if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going full strawberry banana flavor and
adding that to distillate or CBD crystal,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can sell it in the vape stores,
you know, it's like, is that any better
[SPEAKER_00]: for you than, you know, kind of a lot of
the other harmful products that
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately we're able to buy every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and so I think, I think from
my personal standpoint, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer, you know, the, the, it's,
I, and I prefer and I cherish and tribute
[SPEAKER_00]: artisans able to, to recapture and
preserve the natural turmeric expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they, and it's like, wow,
that's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's like my favorite sage I've
ever smoked in flower form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, probably the best way to do that
is with dry sip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then nothing is altered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have the original terpene.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, aside from the most caustic
volatile ones that would have evaporated
[SPEAKER_09]: out in the curing or drying of the herb
and the, the time that it would take you
[SPEAKER_09]: to get those heads off whatnot,
but still very correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, Tony and I, the main
reason we're really doing that Alec with,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, having designed a pen that's not
disposable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I was like, Tony was like,
listen, we got to be a part of this
[SPEAKER_09]: California market.
[SPEAKER_09]: All these pens, there's so much swag.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be great to offer something
great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I was like, well, then we got to
redesign like a pen because you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing great, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, but it's taken so long and it's,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Integrity is just like, if you want high
profits, you can't have high integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so far what I've learned in
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned it at my raw food cafe,
which was super high integrity,
[SPEAKER_09]: super low profits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we just couldn't bring our profits up
high without lowering our integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you go into a project like the
pen project that I'm doing with Tony,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a, it's very high integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's great work, but it's, you know,
in the meantime, all these distillate
[SPEAKER_09]: companies are just pumping hundreds of
thousands of disposable pens that people
[SPEAKER_09]: are like, those aren't good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's not like California needs
to be more responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the distills laced with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple pesticides found in its
substantial amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tested a blood wrap?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tested any of those,
those, whatever things that they wrap the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I would love to, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you should, if you haven't,
you should Alex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like backwards, that would be,
that would be really horrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I do enjoy swimming backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't tested them and you use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not very scientific, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not very scientific.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should've been the first one that was
like, what's in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, could we request that one for the
people, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, uh, could you test one seat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I would love to see the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see if there's any molds
or fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see what's in these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so we have, we have been,
um, so, so we're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a gentleman Roy Upton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's the executive director of the
American herbal pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the guy that kind of helped,
uh, you know, create and lead the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: project to create the cannabis monograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so we, we helped him find some
funding to help kind of further develop
[SPEAKER_00]: out the cannabis monograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big parts of it was to push
and substantiate more of the, the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, concerns around the micro
different aspects of microbiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities on cannabis and which ones are
benign, which ones might be native.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and which ones kind of are
actually pathogenic, hoping to only focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on pathogenic or, I mean, have to,
you know, hoping to be a document to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reinforce that cannabis is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how much are we going to
regulate all these aspects to get zero on
[SPEAKER_00]: this crop of these different microbes
where most of them are benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these ones of concern,
you know, like produce micro toxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an effort to kind of substantiate
that further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're doing the same thing with
pesticide side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so we, one of the projects we're
going to do is, you know, so I'll add
[SPEAKER_00]: blunt wraps of all sorts and types to,
to, to the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, we basically have already bought a
bunch of different types of tobacco brand
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, like tailor-made rolled
cigarettes, American spirit, pouched
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we in the, you know,
about six months ago, we did micro testing
[SPEAKER_00]: on a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, it was actually about
a year ago now, because this is before we
[SPEAKER_00]: had our new, um, these science mass
spectrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we have these new mass specs,
um, you know, where the sensitivities down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the single digit part per billion,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, kind of, we're, we're about
to kind of do a controlled experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: type, uh, you know, we're, we're,
we're able to identify and document a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of different products that are sold
recreationally to the market to see kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of similarly what has pesticides,
what doesn't, what, what certain microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: are there, what aren't, um, on the micro
topic, what we saw is like, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, um, you know, kind of there we see
very low to no yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but in, in a lot of cases,
like American spirit, pouch tobacco and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different types of packs,
we would see about 500, 500,000 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: colony forming units per units per gram in
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I don't know whether that's,
that might be some type of bio insecticide
[SPEAKER_00]: that somebody's using like DT or all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, so, you know, in the,
in the, in the, in the not too distant
[SPEAKER_00]: future, and I'll totally share that with
the entire group, you know, we will have
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide data on kind of a lot of these
different recreational smoked products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause I think those are the most
interesting and comparable to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, after that big NBC article
where, you know, pesticides kind of made
[SPEAKER_00]: this huge splash and, you know,
what have you in Southern California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we did have a couple,
uh, a couple of dispensaries we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: send in like random samples of like
Safeway produce and vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to test kind of tomatoes and
grapes and celery and kind of all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the problems though is
like, you know, in order to do like an
[SPEAKER_00]: apples to apples type of, of, of
comparison of these pesticides and the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of these pesticides,
you kind of need to try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly to cannabis would be dry,
you know, dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you, if you're doing it wet,
you know, the concentration is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: that much less because that much more of
the weight of the sample is going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that this goes back
to the, you know, the, the question I
[SPEAKER_00]: think, um, or, you know, the, the
experiment I think Sam was mentioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we haven't done kind of like the
same plants, you know, kind of measure to
[SPEAKER_00]: see loss and, you know, kind of terpenes
from drying or from these different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects, but we can kind of, um,
make some assumptions based off what we
[SPEAKER_00]: see with, you know, just different
extraction processes like fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_00]: live resin, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome Indra.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about some different
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember, I, you, I remember you had
sent me your thing recently saying that
[SPEAKER_09]: you finally tested those terpenes that
you'd been collecting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we got you muted there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta unmute your microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_08]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one more time.
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were both unmuting your mic
simultaneously because I have the
[SPEAKER_09]: administration abilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, did you read the list of how many
terpenes were there?
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't count them or anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was, uh, I didn't really understand
like the parts per million and stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: like how small some of those, uh,
amounts were like, which one was the
[SPEAKER_09]: primary?
[SPEAKER_09]: Were they in the most to the least list?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that how they went?
[SPEAKER_09]: Your phone's making a lot of weird sounds
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, that's because the phone is the
worst possible way to do this here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the, it doesn't go to the email,
huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me try that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I guess that's, I'm amazed that people
that don't have the phones in the computer
[SPEAKER_09]: is connected.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never think that way, but I can,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go, go on the email.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll send it to you there so you can,
uh, get off the phone cause that's
[SPEAKER_09]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had seconded his, go ahead,
Alec.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I was going to add real quick
before we jumped in that is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause it kind of gets into that
question of like, well, okay, what
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are toxic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dangerous to be adding like unknown
concentrations of different terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think there's something really
interesting to it is like with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Ethan Russo's new paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, beyond cannabis, like exploring
other cannabis mimetic plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of one of the plants that
it gets into is this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant that's, you know, very near and
dear to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, you know, kind of, it's,
it's Copal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copal is a, it's this like, you know,
this, this sap from a tree that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, used indigently, you know,
as a smudge, you know, in ceremony spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, and, and, and,
uh, for what it's worth, Copal has a di
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene in it that by that's a selective
seed between sorry, it's a, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: selective CB1 receptor agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's a, it's binds to CB1 and
it's a terpene that, and the only other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we know binding CB1,
you know, in cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, what's that going to
do when you combine this terpene that
[SPEAKER_00]: binds to CB1 with THC that binds to CB1?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an interesting kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might, there might be a new effect
created.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're just at the cusp of learning
what we will learn in the upcoming 10 and
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be vast when we have
this next generation of young people
[SPEAKER_09]: coming out and getting their degrees,
getting their PhDs and, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: going into it with the full focus of
working in the cannabis field is going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be a whole different ball game.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see a lot of young people excited about
working in the, in the cannabis sector,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's very, it goes off in many,
many different directions.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could go in a thousand different
directions with this plant in regards to
[SPEAKER_09]: focusing your life on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and there's also, there's job
descriptions and job things in different
[SPEAKER_06]: States, you know, where you've got 28
medical States now and six to eight coming
[SPEAKER_06]: online for a recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a lot of opportunities out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, we're still waiting here in
California to figure out what all the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations were all the different things
to come on down and get solidified.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people can start working on their,
their niches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's a lot of niches for places
for people out there, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: science key, very key.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to need more laboratories all
over the United States because there's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to have to be, you know,
ring testing, all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as people managing, you know,
greenhouse management, come on,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going to be major realities and
working in, you know, handling gardens and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing everything proper.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before where these were all OJT were on
the job training.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically you can now actually,
actually get, you know, degrees and
[SPEAKER_06]: actually apply them to cannabis where in
the past it was a little more difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not saying it's easy now, but it's a,
there's a lot more opportunities now with
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulation, everything that's taking
place than there has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also, you also can't say enough about
on the, on the, on the job training aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, it's, it's, it's
fascinating to me kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much you can't, how much of this whole
reality you can't learn in school and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much of an advantage and headstart
that so many people that I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: with in this industry and community for so
long, there's such a depth and profound
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of knowledge about this plant and
how to take care of it, how to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not be reliant on pesticides
whenever you treat it and grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and, and although,
yeah, I mean, I totally get the point
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, for all the new up and
coming kind of passionate members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community, you know, their added
schooling is going to just take this to a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nother level, but it's like such
deep tribute and props to all our mentors
[SPEAKER_00]: that helped us individually get to this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the shit you can't learn in
school, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, for sure not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's why those people will be
working for our companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or these people have started their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can't tell you about my own
employees who started NBPG that have gone
[SPEAKER_06]: on to become doctors, lawyers,
scientists, laboratories, also open their
[SPEAKER_06]: own dispensaries all over.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's a constant spreading of,
you know, and as I said, it goes back to
[SPEAKER_06]: OJT, but there will always be a certain
amount of OJT, but there will be a less
[SPEAKER_06]: need for OJT in the future as more of this
becomes standardized.
[SPEAKER_06]: It becomes, you know, formulas for
business to standard operational
[SPEAKER_06]: procedures that, you know, like I said,
back in the day, I didn't start off with a
[SPEAKER_06]: book of rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: But over time, after nearly 18 years now,
I got a lot of rules because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of people who along the way that showed
us, you know, and shout outs to our
[SPEAKER_06]: mentors and those that came before us that
showed us how to do it, because back in
[SPEAKER_06]: the day, you know, I was the quiet one
doing changing the reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we don't even have to change
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got dosatrons and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So technology has changed even what I used
to get paid 25 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to sit there and do now,
you know, people are getting to pay to
[SPEAKER_06]: trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're talking about the wine industry
is worried about competing with the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis industry because of how still
labor intensive cannabis is and is going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can't afford to pay the wages
that cannabis companies can currently play
[SPEAKER_06]: due to the unsubstantiated, you know,
false market that exists due to
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition that will change as regulation
comes online.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it hasn't so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, not at all in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still very costly and expensive to be
at the tip of the arrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're leading the way so that,
you know, I've always felt seven
[SPEAKER_06]: generations to come so that seven
generations from now, they won't know our
[SPEAKER_06]: sorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't know our pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've laid the groundwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am one that believes that I'm planting a
tree that I will never sit under the
[SPEAKER_06]: shade.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for some reason, I've been blessed to
sit under the shade a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, the the people in the
industry are basically all mostly good
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my wallet at the cup and dropped
out of my pocket when I fell over on my
[SPEAKER_03]: scooter while I was going around rolling
over one of the many bumps to keep the
[SPEAKER_03]: wires from had quite a bit of money in it,
had my entire life in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize it until the last part of
the day that it was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of bummed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know how to feel about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And three days later, a package arrived in
the mail and I had a lump and I pulled it
[SPEAKER_03]: open and dumped it on the table and it was
my wallet with the all of the money and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything there and the most beautiful
note from the guys who found it said,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, John, we found your wallet and its
contents near the cash can right next to
[SPEAKER_03]: my booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this would reach you
safely, but here's the wallet and call
[SPEAKER_03]: this number and I will get your cash back
to you immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: John and Chris, a couple of really sweet
guys sent back all of it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was, you know, if this would have
been at any other fair or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would have been a gone gorgonzola for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people at these events are people like
the rest of us that are trying to rise up
[SPEAKER_03]: and not be the scenario that they're
constantly pointing their finger at us as
[SPEAKER_03]: criminals, crooks, ne'er-do-wells and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were ne'er-do-wells, this industry
wouldn't have climbed to the point where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the face of all negativity and in the
face of the politicians carrying your main
[SPEAKER_03]: power, in the face of the people who
constantly talk bad about pot,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've still risen to the point where we're
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a big giant fair, lost the
wallet with a couple of G's in it and it
[SPEAKER_03]: came back in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, that the people in this community
aren't good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just not gonna play with me
at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really nice to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are always opportunities when you
find a wallet full of money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, often people think the
opportunity is, oh, I found a bunch of
[SPEAKER_09]: money.
[SPEAKER_09]: But really the opportunity is to do the
right thing, to be good and to send it
[SPEAKER_09]: back to where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole thing about the whole
community is exactly what you just said,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're accusing us of trying to make a
bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people in the industry
doing that, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people in the industry who would
steal flies from a blind spider,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm the first one to admit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the majority of the people in the
community are good people and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that constant pressure of trying to do
the right thing back in the face of this
[SPEAKER_03]: oppression is what's gonna save us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now look, the VA is starting to tremble a
little bit because there's so many vets
[SPEAKER_03]: right now crying back to the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: That death rate from suicide for PTSD is
rising as we see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are people who are trying to
combat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's people trying to combat it as we
speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got a lot of people out there
who think that the little tiny caveat of
[SPEAKER_03]: pot that it gives to hide this and all the
healing stuff it does is driving the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: of us crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does something good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because you get a little high
while it's doing it, people don't want us
[SPEAKER_03]: to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll drink and they'll smoke and
they'll drive their cars fast and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of the things that are truly a
danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have guns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick and tired of guns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got shot by one in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can imagine, I don't have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even want them anywhere near me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, and not change subjects
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the terpenes, there were listed there
in parts per millions, but that wasn't the
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: The list was lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was long, and there were many,
many terpenes on that list that I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: seen on other lists yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they were just there in parts per
million, it points out to the fact that as
[SPEAKER_03]: our technology grows and we're able to
advance in our understanding, we're
[SPEAKER_03]: picking up new terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're picking up terpenes that we
previously haven't been picking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just always for advancing this
whole deal as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's do it on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indra, if you wouldn't mind, what were
some of the terpenes you were just
[SPEAKER_00]: describing that you were seeing that,
you know, aren't kind of currently being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested for by some of the labs?
[SPEAKER_03]: This was tested in a lab in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you send it to me on an email or
something?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that how you sent it to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent it to you on your email.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe I can screen share it or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be, I'd be really psyched to see
that and look into it because,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if I, if I may real quick to chime in
on that and, and, and to your point,
[SPEAKER_00]: Indra, I think, I think it's such a huge
one because you know, I mean, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: such, you know, there's, you know,
the, the, the terpene science and such is
[SPEAKER_00]: such a new frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, you know, the alcohol
esters and the other kind of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there in tiny part per million
amounts, you know, seem to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like what we were talking about
earlier with the spice comparison and how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a certain amount of salt will do
something to a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then steaming actually changes the
entire profile of the soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's, it's really
interesting in how much the certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: in tiny amounts are substantially
affecting the overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, but what I would say
to the, what I would say that really
[SPEAKER_00]: complicates a lot of this whole kind of
conversation, which really sucks up to
[SPEAKER_00]: this point is, is the, the need for the
standardization of laboratory data to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to make apples to apples comparisons,
because up to this point, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've seen in so much of the terpene
testing that's done is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: often in times, you know, kind of
completely wrong terpenes being,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, quantified or, or, or,
you know, or, or did, or reported,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from an unverified or
unvalidated terpene kind of run on a GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my greatest example of that is,
you know, one of the biggest labs in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, you know, for so long has been
putting kind of out these terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, you know, showing, you know,
suggesting that pining alpha pining,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, was the terpene dominant in,
in, in all these ranged strains from from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack to train wreck to X J to J one street
to dirt into, you know, sage and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and that's completely wrong,
you know, and, and kind of, and from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: from that unvalidated terpene run and that
amount of publicly displayed the data of
[SPEAKER_00]: this wrong terpene as the primary terpene
in this, this whole class of strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they really kind of took a hit,
you know, in some of their scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, you know, and, and,
and unfortunately, you know, in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in most states, including California,
including Oregon, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, terpene testing isn't yet
the test that is being required to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through, you know, a further accreditation
proficiency testing process, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to do that test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and because in Oregon, you know,
Oregon really set a standard, an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: standard in California is following it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that, okay, if you're going to
have, if you're going to regulate and have
[SPEAKER_00]: strong kind of, you know, limits and
regulations on the, producers and
[SPEAKER_00]: processors of products in these regulated
markets, you actually have to have an even
[SPEAKER_00]: stricter level of scrutiny and regulation
on the laboratories that are doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, so, and so, so Oregon was the
first state to, to, to substantiate that
[SPEAKER_00]: through their regulations, California is
following them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're requiring is that,
you know, in Oregon, a lab has to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through basically this, this group called
ORLAP, the Oregon Laboratory Assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and they have to go through
ORLAP, to, excuse me, they have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through ORLAP basically and do a
proficiency testing process to show and
[SPEAKER_00]: substantiate to this laboratory evaluation
program that they can do the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing that are going to be required for
them to do and to pick up these compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: in these amounts, in these mixtures and
these different spike matrices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I, this one particular lab that I
use, I don't know if you've heard of them
[SPEAKER_03]: or not, but it's MRX Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did a pretty, they did a pretty
thorough testing of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came up with alpha-pinene,
campene, mercene, beta-pinene,
[SPEAKER_03]: greek-perene, alpha-terpenene,
limonene, osmene, gamma-terpene,
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenylene, linaloo, iso-puligol,
geranol, beta-carapethylene, cumulene,
[SPEAKER_03]: norelidal, transnorelidal, guadalajara,
guaiol, and alpha-bizibol, which was a
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly complete list of a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot from these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: For one, if you're not careful when you
store your terpenes, different stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: happens to the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next thing you know, you start finding
isopropanol and acetate in your terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's because some of the terpenes
thermally degrade into those compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you gotta keep them in a amber bottle,
and you gotta keep them cool, otherwise
[SPEAKER_03]: they start going off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole problem with shelf life.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the bottles that I carried around
with me at the cup in my pocket,
[SPEAKER_03]: and for four days was in the heat,
I sent in to them, and immediately it came
[SPEAKER_03]: back, and it had all this other garbage in
it, which blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, isopropanol, there's no way
that that could possibly, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: collected these terpenes using our new
machine, the Blue Meany, and it
[SPEAKER_03]: refrigerates down to minus 20 pretty easy,
and so we were getting copious amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I sent that in, it came back with
a tiny, tiny amount of acetone and
[SPEAKER_03]: isopropanol in it, and that just blew my
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did it over again, and I sent
that back into them, and it came clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I talked a lot with Clancy of
Callahan, the guy at Scientific 710,
[SPEAKER_03]: where they make the machine, and they had
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found a number of people now that
I've been looking that have come up with
[SPEAKER_03]: the same info about the terpenes,
that you gotta be careful how you keep
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta look into the ones that you've
got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a couple of terpenes that are
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been separating them out as best as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've come up with a vasodilator.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You stick it under your nose and take like
three or four deep breaths.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feel your face get warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feel your hands get warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's opening the blood flow all over your
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a bronchial dilator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, four breaths of it, and I have two
friends who are on these asthma things,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're using this bronchial dilator
terpene now, and they think it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: hottest thing since it's sunburned.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't wanna be removed from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if we can start getting a
really complete feed out on these
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes, one of the things that I was
doing that somebody wasn't happy about,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when I decarbed for people
occasionally, and when they wanted the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff decarbed, I always put the terpene
collector between the vacuum oven,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what I use for decarbing,
and the vacuum pump.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got around 75 or 80 milliliters of
gold in terpenes, but within those
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes are the ones that will thermally
degrade, so you have to be very careful
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on an aggressive program
separating them as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found one method of getting the
isopropanol and acetone out is put three
[SPEAKER_03]: or four drops of water in with the bottle
of terpene, shake it up good, put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the septuatory funnel, drain the water
off, because both the acetone and the
[SPEAKER_03]: isopropanol will go into the water phase
of that, and then you can separate them
[SPEAKER_03]: and have your terpenes clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm pretty sure that it's gonna take a
lot of time and effort to find out how to
[SPEAKER_03]: combine these terpenes with the various
oils to come up with the effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna try to work on that somewhat
this year, now that I know that I've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: source to collect terpenes the way I need
and want to collect them.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's unique about these degradations of
terpenes is they're probably not only
[SPEAKER_09]: going to happen on their own when
collected, but they could potentially also
[SPEAKER_09]: happen in the gland heads while they're in
cured bud or old bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's such an awesome thing you
said, because that really connected for me
[SPEAKER_00]: this interesting weird thing that we've
been seeing that might be adding to both
[SPEAKER_00]: your points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that, you know, in certain
flower and extracts, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes we will see these small kind of
trace residual solvent levels that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present that are not used or should be
there kind of in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of, yeah, fascinating kind of
work, Indra, on what you're doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, because yeah, that's from what we
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the analytical reference standards
that we have with these different
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, it's so important how they're
stored and how the calibration ladders are
[SPEAKER_00]: built and the runs developed because
they're so sensitive that they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to break down really quickly in these
different conditions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to, you know, what you were just
saying, Marcus, with the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be these weird endogenous
levels of certain compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, that might be happening
from different, you know, overheated kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, rooms or, you know,
just different kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that are being done,
you know, on the plant and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alec, let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I've been thinking about
for a long time, they've talked about it
[SPEAKER_03]: on the church here quite a bit about
what's in the stem of the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's in the leaf, and then how it goes
into the little factory of the trichrome
[SPEAKER_03]: and manifests ultimately in the head of
the trichrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that, while I was listening to it,
made me realize that that must mean that
[SPEAKER_03]: when you extract the plant or when you
separate that out, that there's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a race mix in there of the pre-stuff,
the stuff, and the after stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gonna be, as we start using finer
and finer equipment to analyze what's
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out in these extractions,
you're gonna start seeing little ticks
[SPEAKER_03]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that recently somebody pointed out
at one of the research labs that there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of butane naturally in the health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there must be a mix of things that
we haven't entirely paid attention to yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping that with the new lab
certifications and the new requirements
[SPEAKER_03]: for people working in the lab,
we'll start getting some real information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Alec, do you think now with the,
I know you were trying to with this new
[SPEAKER_06]: competition with the Cannabis County Fair,
going with that type of, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene classification where, you know,
grouping them together, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you involved in that decision-making
process to arrive at that point?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that something that was brought
forth by the Cannabis County Fair?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can see competition- It was
largely me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can see by having that type of
classification, you can start to drive
[SPEAKER_06]: other labs into other competitions into
raising their standards so that they can
[SPEAKER_06]: speak of this competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even such as when I was over in
Barcelona this year for Spanabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked to them and of course,
you know, they were testing their cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: that was in the competitions that I was
involved in, but they're only testing,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, for THC content or CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have any type of anything else
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, are you guys looking to
step your game up?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: By seeing what's happening in the United
States, it causes them to put pressure on
[SPEAKER_06]: their laboratories there to start pushing
them to that they can be at the standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have to give, you know,
Barcelona props.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their quality has grown exponentially as
well as their testing ability.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also shows that there's still holes
in the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but it also shows through what,
you know, the Cannabis County Fair was
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to do with its competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it spreads into a potentially
Emerald Cup and into I take it that
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Country Fair will happen then
next year, next summer on a more
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable date and time and with more
time planned and kind of effort put into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, and I really
appreciate those words, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, it's such a large way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have such deep love and
admiration, respect for Tim Blake,
[SPEAKER_00]: Blake's, Taylor Blake, and how much they
personally have been mentors involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: my life and why I'm with and in the
cannabis community and why SC Labs exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then so being involved,
you know, I mean, I've been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Cup the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, since I moved out here,
and we, you know, Taylor and I were living
[SPEAKER_00]: up at Area 101 and involved, you know,
kind of organic farming and life changing
[SPEAKER_00]: in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was which was after I got out of the
Navy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm kind of being involved in the Cup
and seeing it grow and really seeing it
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the point where there's now,
you know, 800 plus flower entries,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, last year, I mean, it gets to
the point where all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: the integrity of the overall judging,
what might be, you know, even like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong kind of plan, you know,
from the top, you know, and how the judges
[SPEAKER_00]: can be done, it really kind of,
you know, brings a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: overall to help people can even judge that
and how people can kind of make similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of judging criteria,
if they're smoking that many strains a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in so many ways,
kind of just, you know, the judging
[SPEAKER_00]: process is involved in just like,
the overall quality of the look,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel the bag appeal, you know,
the trim kind of, you know, how you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's if it's sticky and still cured,
you know, and just all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects kind of go into judging,
but but you can't deny the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemometric data, cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and in so many ways,
you know, what we saw with this curbing
[SPEAKER_00]: classification system, I was really kind
of, you know, going to Tim, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that, you know, with, you know,
hoping that eventually can kind of evolve
[SPEAKER_00]: into the emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, with the cannabis country
fair, it was gonna be a lot smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: but total sample set, so that we could try
this, you know, try this out for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for just in general,
try it out just to as an experiment to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how well it works in the judging,
because the idea was going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sides micro are going to be run
residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything's out of spec,
then it was going to get disqualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else that was qualified,
you know, basically was going to get sent
[SPEAKER_00]: through this algorithm for terpenes
cannabinoids, and then sorted into these
[SPEAKER_00]: different primary and subgroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were hopefully going to be
given to the the entrance, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these already sorted groups so that you
can make similar judging against similar
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling, or certain similar profiled bud,
you know, hoping that the data wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily bias all the other judging
attributes, but it hopefully would help
[SPEAKER_00]: inform, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it definitely helps inform because
it separates the wheat from the chaff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we saw everybody we used to Oh,
look at the size of my bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a great donkey dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's great and all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what is the data?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we can see what's actually inside
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it no longer is size that
matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what are your turps say?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's their retention?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, on top of the THC content
CBD and looking for you know, to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things you're trying to find
that stuff, you know, yeah, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think also, and I think,
and I'm sorry, just to finish the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's like, I think also,
you know, one of the big efforts was like
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping to, you know, celebrate by,
you know, through using or identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: these different categories and giving
awards these different smell groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you'd be able to in a way,
help to celebrate and bring out the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of cannabis, you know,
because so many times what we've seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Cup is people would enter some
like really interesting and unique kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: novel strains that you know, what actually
there would be complete outliers to the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire data set and should probably get an
award but because nobody even knew what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, it couldn't even get
judged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a couple examples of this would be
some weird landry strains that were like
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one THC, one to one THC to THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's this like black beauty
strain out right now in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one, you know, and a lot of the
barren strains kind of are, are bred
[SPEAKER_00]: around from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, at the time,
nobody even knew to judge it, or what have
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just kind of slipped through the
cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, you know, with with being able
to kind of put things in these buckets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then give awards in place,
you can also then to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: identify these really unique novel aspects
that people might enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, through that help to
breed out that overall kind of terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: into the broader market, and elevate it to
the public as well as which, of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: causes further market saturation of the
diversity of products that have since come
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, books since CBD has been
synthesized, re synthesized, and look at
[SPEAKER_06]: the plethora of products on the market
that have spilled forth just off that one
[SPEAKER_06]: compound alone, not saying it's good or
bad, etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just pointing out causality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about, what about guys,
when it shows up, and it will believe me,
[SPEAKER_03]: constructed concentrates, that is
concentrates constructed from really
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely fine oils, and terpenes
collected separately, but mixed back in
[SPEAKER_03]: and offered as in the concentrate contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you gonna do about that when that
shows up?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's already been showing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened already.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have been kicked out of the cups
because of that, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, I was making this
point kind of earlier before you jumped
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, if anybody that might figure
it out, I would imagine you probably would
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what we see mostly, like whenever
people are attempting to take all these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, other found derived terpenes,
and then re add them or reintroduce them
[SPEAKER_00]: in certain concentrations to, you know,
a distillate or some other type of
[SPEAKER_00]: product, typically, it doesn't work out
well for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if you compare that side to
side, the sauce, live resin, holy water,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural turf extraction, kind of preserve,
you know, extract, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin with like natural turps re added
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is it's crazy how,
how much natural games getting and the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic kind of reintroduced game
doesn't seem like it's, it's, it's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: as perfected yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can usually typically pull it out
side by side and immediately kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, that's, you know, not like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, probably 99.9% of them don't know
their ass from a hole in the ground,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're pouring too much stuff in and
they don't really understand the rules
[SPEAKER_03]: around combining something back together
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're never going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to always tip the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Darren, there's two of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all I just mean, this place is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, but anyway, these people will mix
these things and they're greedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the greed is the universal blindfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I don't want to let the cat out
of the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it can it be done?
[SPEAKER_03]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I want it to I could I don't want
to play that man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should have a category being
judged there of just pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know when Tony when I bumped
into him at the top, he just wanted to dab
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't want any of the oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just stuck in and dab the terpenes off.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, about 30 or 40 people just wanted
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I think there's a need
actually for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, you know, I know with the
Mocup and with even even you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hitman crew, I mean, I think the
Hitman crew with like chalice and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go back and look, but they might
actually be having a certain terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: category this year in their event in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you know, that's it's it's
it's one of the fascinating things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the really novel
innovations within the community are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of almost pushing the need for these
novel, you know, unique categories to be
[SPEAKER_00]: populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only once there's enough of that
demand within the kind of cups or within
[SPEAKER_00]: the market or the judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that, you know, begets the
need for that to be created in the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that time is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's anything wrong with
creating constant tapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one of my favorite ones is I made
Jack and I mixed Tony and Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_03]: banana straw manna goo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mixed that with Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put that in my dabber and dab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a delightful combination,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think, you know, there should be
room for combining things, be it terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: and oils or whatever, and judging them
because there's some fantastic ones out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm just in love with some of
the stuff I picked up while I was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: But going back to what you were saying,
Alec, it was our demand of testing and
[SPEAKER_06]: labs in the first place that started,
you know, we started going in those
[SPEAKER_06]: directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a causality of demand,
you know, so we can then propagate.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's the reality is that we
have to spend our hard earned money and it
[SPEAKER_06]: costs, you know, you won't realize how
much it costs the Emerald Cup to test
[SPEAKER_06]: those 800 flowers or the 1000 plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now add then add any type of other
testing, as you know, cost you more to do,
[SPEAKER_06]: which means it costs me more to get done
by you.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the more that gets out there,
the more the questions that are asked and
[SPEAKER_06]: get out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these other laboratories start
ring testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And next thing you know, you've got a
community that is well tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can feel very good about taking
those next steps so that we can add
[SPEAKER_06]: because, as you know, just we started off
with THC and now we're stepping into all
[SPEAKER_06]: these complete and other boundaries that
are opening up even more doorways and more
[SPEAKER_06]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your point incredibly
because, you know, I think not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: tribute is given to some of these events
and how much they are actually influencing
[SPEAKER_00]: and affecting, you know, the culture and
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it wasn't until the Emerald
Cup kind of took on this level of burden
[SPEAKER_00]: and testing and money to do the testing so
that they could help substantiate their
[SPEAKER_00]: event that some of these interesting
realizations about pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction processes and all this was
actually even an issue, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going back a couple of years in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, then kind of hitman crewed
with Chalice and had a place, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: did something very similar and now have
this commitment to doing that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing to help qualify or disqualify
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the process of people being
disqualified and having somewhat of public
[SPEAKER_00]: shaming, you know, or an Instagram
trolling of their brand because they
[SPEAKER_00]: failed for pesticides in this public
event, you know, it's inside of so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, from my, you know, kind of insight,
biggest players or biggest kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of brands within California
cannabis community, you know, evolve their
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, cut things out of their program,
like fossil load or Bushmaster or certain
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic fungicides and pesticides,
you know, because they took it so
[SPEAKER_00]: personally from failing the Emerald Cup or
failing Chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, not enough props
is given to, you know, the judges and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, helping with the events,
pushing the boundaries in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that getting people ready for
what is to come with regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then the people want, they want the
truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to know what they're seeing is
proper and they want people to follow the
[SPEAKER_06]: right things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is shown because we've seen a whole
different sociological experiments crop up
[SPEAKER_06]: in our community because of social media
and testing and failures or successes or
[SPEAKER_06]: successes that were successes until the
test came out and then came out and that
[SPEAKER_06]: they failed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then those types of public shaming,
these are things that we've never really
[SPEAKER_06]: seen in our community because we've never
had a standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was never a shelf that we could say,
Hey, that THC is actually that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has changed the discussion and it
really goes back and I got to forever give
[SPEAKER_06]: props to, you know, the first ones to
really put out what we were Harborside to
[SPEAKER_06]: in Oakland to really put out THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it caused an initial stir because it
caused a problem because I started to see
[SPEAKER_06]: vendors coming my way saying, Hey,
what I was getting for this and the amount
[SPEAKER_06]: of money for, I can't get any more because
the testing says it's this number down
[SPEAKER_06]: here where in the past they were getting
at this amount of money with no problem at
[SPEAKER_06]: all going off of their organoleptic,
which is their visual cues, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could see, whereas science has
literally separated the wheat from the
[SPEAKER_06]: chaff because we are now have a standard
that we can look to and hold on to and
[SPEAKER_06]: grasp onto.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for being a pioneer in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for holding yourself to the
scientific standards so that we can all
[SPEAKER_06]: rise together equally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Eric, do you guys post all your lab
test results on a public board?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't, would you consider doing
so?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last few years, actually,
you know, we had this tested button on our
[SPEAKER_00]: website and then you could click that and
any data that a client had that we work
[SPEAKER_00]: with or a collective that we work with had
done, if they click and made this sample
[SPEAKER_00]: public, you know, then it was basically
viewable on this aspect of the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the last few months, for what it's
worth, we temporarily kind of took it down
[SPEAKER_00]: until we could figure out a better way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we found is there's about,
there's like three groups that were from
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of like United States and
one part, you know, one from outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country that were basically mining our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like they had kind of,
I guess they had just like some scripts
[SPEAKER_00]: written to where they were basically just
taking every data point and just mining it
[SPEAKER_00]: from our site and had like, you know,
these trackers that would just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime somebody would make a sample
public, they would basically be pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, yeah, we just,
you know, basically took that down in an
[SPEAKER_00]: effort to try to re-figure out how we can
relaunch the public display without
[SPEAKER_00]: basically getting pirated for the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because for what it's worth,
I mean, in so many ways, the data is like
[SPEAKER_00]: not as valuable, I guess, as a lot of
people would think, you know, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: project we've been working on this Terpene
classification system, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be many systems that are
launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's already a couple out
there, you know, market is just the best
[SPEAKER_00]: there is at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and we're not looking to
replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking just at how the system that
we can basically, you know, have our
[SPEAKER_00]: clients and people that we work with be
able to use to further help them
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and value the data that we
provide, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that old color graphics you had
about the Terpenes was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of hoping you were going to
bring something like that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, and that absolutely, you know,
there we are, you know, taking kind of our
[SPEAKER_00]: current graphic displays of Terpenes and
charts and colors and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: launching that to a new level and it
should have that launched in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple, you know, in the next month or two
with a Terpene classification system and
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that, you know, colors can help to
intuitively bring out some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: complex kind of Terpene, you know,
data points, like, you know, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard for a lot of subset of the
community to, you know, start to really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand or even be able to pronounce
Terpenelene or Gatorgyrophelene,
[SPEAKER_00]: these different Terpenes and then let
alone kind of understand how certain ones
[SPEAKER_00]: might be affecting, you know, working with
CHC to affect the strain in a certain way
[SPEAKER_00]: or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, you know, the system needs
to add a little bit more clarity and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, bring more, you know,
light to the rainbow of effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: variants that cannabis has.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and also just the last point of
that is, you know, to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: unique certain things are because,
you know, whenever, you know, most strains
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis that we have been passed
through and most of the subgroups,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a primary, but most of the
subgroups are within, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Miercing class because that's the
biggest and most primary class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miercing seems to be the most dominant
Terpene around, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this other primary group that has,
you know, a tenth of the total data
[SPEAKER_00]: points, but there's enough samples to
signify the need for its own primary
[SPEAKER_00]: grouping, and that's alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you very rarely see alpha-pinene
as the dominant Terpene, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: one of the things I wanted to mention was,
you know, we're just, okay, for 20 years
[SPEAKER_09]: or so, there's been some Terpene talk a
little bit less thanks to Sam and his
[SPEAKER_09]: experiment in early 2000, but I wonder
how, you know, beta-karyophylline is the
[SPEAKER_09]: Terpene that drug dogs are using.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're tested for, correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that they smell the most or that
they test for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought they were, they were trained
with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that they trained drug dogs with
beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, that is true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I heard this as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's interesting that, like,
probably when most people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: world didn't even know what
beta-karyophylline was, somehow the police
[SPEAKER_09]: knew what it was and knew to train their
drug dogs with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had Terpene knowledge before us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because, Mark, there's a lot
of beta-karyophylline in pot, and in those
[SPEAKER_03]: days, they probably were only measuring,
I don't know, Sam will probably tell me
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wrong on this, but I think they were
only measuring for a few of the Terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: by, the police labs went to the other labs
and asked them, hey, what should we look
[SPEAKER_03]: into?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, well, alpha-pinene,
beta-karyophylline, linaloo, any of those
[SPEAKER_03]: might be good candidates because there's a
lot of them present in the Terpene count
[SPEAKER_03]: on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But carry on, blank.
[SPEAKER_09]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what happened with Alec
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess he'll probably be back in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd said he's out for the day and will
see us next week with beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guild Extract said we should give all the
car window washers at the Mexican border
[SPEAKER_09]: spray bottles with beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the joke on the ferry here,
actually, for some years.
[SPEAKER_09]: One year they just, on the BC ferry from
the Sunshine Coast, they did this big
[SPEAKER_09]: thing where they just brought drug dogs on
the ferry, walked through the area and
[SPEAKER_09]: busted a few people with pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the big joke was to take five
gallon batches of bubble water and just
[SPEAKER_09]: pour it down the ferry floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better yet, drive up by the cop cars with
a spray bottle, roll your window down,
[SPEAKER_03]: spray the tires on the street side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time that the police cars go
back in the compound and the canine dogs
[SPEAKER_03]: come out to get in them, they'll go
fucking nuts over the tires on the police
[SPEAKER_03]: cars.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just glad to slowly but surely be
moving away from even having to,
[SPEAKER_09]: like, you know, you're definitely not
figuring out valuable, like say Terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: profile and how it interacts with the
endocannabinoid system and how to,
[SPEAKER_09]: like, put your body better at ease.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're focused on how to smuggle,
how to get away from the police,
[SPEAKER_09]: how to evade, how to, like, this is
insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Court costs, lawyers, like this is,
these two things need to be disconnected
[SPEAKER_09]: forever because.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody voted for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody voted for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not one of those people that believes
voting actually gets anyone into power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think politicians believe in the
old, you can fool some of the people some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fool all the people some of the
time, but they don't like to believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't fool all the people all the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's the system that we seem to be
living in anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they fix that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way they fix that is the ones that
they can't fool, they put in jail for
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they just say that it's illegal to
not be fooled all the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what about this gentleman from New
Jersey, the New Jersey med man,
[SPEAKER_09]: this dude with the dreads that's
constantly getting arrested and in trouble
[SPEAKER_09]: from the police.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they jailed him again.
[SPEAKER_09]: New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be getting his name wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that, do you know him, Etienne,
this activist?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know of him the New Jersey weed man.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's he's kind of always been on the front
lines and he gets out there and waves it
[SPEAKER_06]: in their face and is fearless.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, they have, as we all know,
as Todd has found out firsthand and others
[SPEAKER_06]: have, you know, when they want to fuck
with you, they will make your life a
[SPEAKER_06]: living fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have unfortunately made New
Jersey and weed man's life a hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's trying to do his best out there
on the East Coast with the draconian laws
[SPEAKER_06]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm hearing that New Jersey has a
governor, somebody running for governor
[SPEAKER_06]: against Chris Christie, who is cannabis
friendly and wants to legalize cannabis in
[SPEAKER_06]: New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And look, I went to West Virginia
University, as people used to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the New Jersey University,
because it's just far enough away for the
[SPEAKER_06]: kids from New Jersey to get away from
their parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their parents couldn't sneak up on them,
but they could also it was a partying
[SPEAKER_06]: school as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So but, you know, New Jersey really needs
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their economy could, you know,
help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the model of the state,
New Jersey, the garden state.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hempstead, New Jersey, even, you know,
Hempstead.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says that on the license plates,
the garbage state.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just joking about the garbage state.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's I'm not sure which one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Idaho.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just making a New Jersey joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got love for my New Jersey peeps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got that joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: The New Jersey turnpike is garbage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But last I heard, yeah, New Jersey weed
man was still getting fucked with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have no idea where this saga in lies
currently.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wish him luck all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's pissed off the local cops and the
state cops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, he's on a hunger strike.
[SPEAKER_09]: This Ed Forshaw, the New Jersey weed man,
two weeks into a hunger strike right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can't we can't not mention
Peter Tosh's son right now, who's also
[SPEAKER_09]: been like beaten in prison into a coma.
[SPEAKER_09]: They beat him into a coma and he's in
there for like joints, herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got caught with herb and he was doing
six months and got into this big,
[SPEAKER_09]: got a big beating put on him and he's in a
coma.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, you guys can Google that and find
out what's going on with that support to
[SPEAKER_09]: the Tosh family.
[SPEAKER_09]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter also Peter Tosh had also been beaten
many a time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if he ever gotten beat into a
coma, but he definitely got smoked and
[SPEAKER_09]: cracked.
[SPEAKER_09]: They cracked his head open a good few
times with batons.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it happened in America.
[SPEAKER_09]: The the Tosh's son.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just do a quick quick Google so I
can give you a little bit more beaten into
[SPEAKER_09]: coma in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jersey jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a garden state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jailers didn't necessarily have to be the
prisoners that beat him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same people who beat people up all the
time, hang them in their cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mysterious hangings, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people die in their cells from lack of
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too long ago, the black guy who was
going to join Homeland Security,
[SPEAKER_03]: it came out that a pregnant woman died of
thirst in his jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then he said, well, I'm not going
to take that job now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like Jesus, like you could get it
in the first place after starving and
[SPEAKER_03]: killing people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the torture state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What goes on here in this country anymore
passes for civility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we call ourselves civilized and
Mahatma Gandhi when they asked him,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you think about civilization in
America?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I think it would be a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus, damn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's crazy that we were talking
about New Jersey and then that's where
[SPEAKER_09]: young Tosh got beaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Mahatma Gandhi ever went to
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he went to London and he was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just asked him in an interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what it was was they said,
what do you think about the West,
[SPEAKER_03]: which claims to be civilized?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I think it would be a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find it online if you look enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have to come to America to say
that either, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure enough of America came to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know this much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Darren, you sleeping, Darren?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just cut your grass hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can share the bone rep line across the
planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone can say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, true enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter S.
[SPEAKER_08]: says it upside down every time.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a Cuban sift and it tends pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chunk and a key.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your pipe now, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: A beautiful D rec and hitman pipe that it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a couple of three, four different
pipes given to me since then, and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: all sitting on the shelf somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still only use this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did put a D on it because, well,
I just lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put a D on it and now it's ready all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that didn't change the fact that it
hits amazingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single time I pick it up and hit
it, I think about you like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, many blessings.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you get much use and joy out of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great design pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to D rec who did the design on
the outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, Dougie and them do design some
good pipes and that one hits like a
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking champ.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad it's being used all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day, at least 10 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss you guys at the cup, but I got a
bottle of terpenes for you guys to try
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've been keeping in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to sooner or later get it to
you because everybody tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony looked at me and he said,
so I think it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always more effective to let those
who have complimented you be the ones who
[SPEAKER_09]: compliment you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you blow your own horn, it sounds
like 20%.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if Tony was in here saying that you'd
get the full 100% out of the value of that
[SPEAKER_09]: comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying I got you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've invited him a bunch of times today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted him to come in for the terpene
conversation, but he's busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Sunday is like one day.
[SPEAKER_09]: He can actually probably get a little bit
of a rest, although I wouldn't even be
[SPEAKER_09]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's fucking moving or not even in the
country or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also too, you were talking about,
Marcus, you were talking about the effects
[SPEAKER_01]: of minor terpenes as on the effect of the
major terpenes, how they're affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did analysis of scratch number one,
I found over 50 different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a few peaks that I wasn't able
to ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might've easily been 60,
including minor terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite a sweep of a smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: There must've been certain ones that were
just constantly there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it more in the cannabinoid spikes?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I remember you saying in the past
that you were able to distinguish by
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing a GC test of something,
whether it had some skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that's because it had a
particular profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was high in mersene, limelene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what else right now,
but you could very easily, if you had a GC
[SPEAKER_01]: of a tie and the GC of a skunk and the GC
of a napkin, and then you cross them in
[SPEAKER_01]: some way, the offspring you could easily,
easily tell what families they were
[SPEAKER_01]: originated from, what progeny they were
grown because the profiles of the GC just
[SPEAKER_01]: spelled it out really clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on the test that I had done,
the things that were in there in greater
[SPEAKER_03]: quantity was alpha-pinene, mycine,
little beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, pronouncing these things,
I found the key to it is simply get a
[SPEAKER_03]: clothespin and put it on your bottom lip
and you can pronounce them correctly.
[SPEAKER_09]: All good questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gild extracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to get him in here next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got lots of good things to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's talking about how we can discover
different pesticides and terpenes peaking
[SPEAKER_09]: at the same time as some pesticides and
giving false positive negatives.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, Alex is no longer here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't get Mark Skoldone today,
so I'll try to line up Alec again,
[SPEAKER_09]: get Gild in the room, have Mark,
maybe get Chimera, and have a nice,
[SPEAKER_09]: good, longer conversation about these
particular things for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a point of interest,
you know, as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little work we've been doing is the
silicon gel filter, properly configured in
[SPEAKER_03]: the extraction unit, will pull
insecticides out of the extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's a good thing that
you're cleaning up extract with
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticides in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to be honest, I'm happy it could
be done, but I don't want to be part of
[SPEAKER_01]: that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck are they putting
insecticides on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, I just am mentioning it
because it's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it within our system, which goes
unnamed and unmentioned hereabouts anyway,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I discovered that that does that,
and so I always say to people,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, before you extract, you should have
the stuff tested so you know whether or
[SPEAKER_03]: not you have to defeat insecticide or not,
because I wouldn't do it as a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, and I wouldn't advertise that you
should do it as a regular thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People should start testing from the
moment the plant comes out of the ground
[SPEAKER_03]: or gets harvested, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time it gets to the concentrate
maker, it should already have a clean bill
[SPEAKER_03]: of health, because everything that goes to
the concentrate maker will do exactly what
[SPEAKER_03]: that says, concentrate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is how it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: Concentrate the good with the bad,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_09]: Best to make sure that you just got the
good in the first place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a little bit of integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a lot of integrity, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a lot of integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't affect quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't affect quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: Integrity does not affect quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I patented it a new way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spray it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just at the end of flowering, you just
spray it everywhere?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you spray it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes Sam's humor will just... I don't
even understand it, but I laugh anyway
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't understand it always.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alien humor.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alien humor for certain.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are definitely an alien, I would say
that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a lovely Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to have Dutch humor rubbing off
on him to say some of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Dutch jokes are decidedly
different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, some of the world's top comics are
from Holland.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean Canada?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we're the funniest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we got a few.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ton of funny people from Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're self-included.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Candy, Jim Carrey.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike Myers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike Myers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, proportionately, Canada comes up
with more funny people than they do here
[SPEAKER_03]: in the USA.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny people that come up here in the
USA are people like Jeff Sessions,
[SPEAKER_03]: who recently lauded the Filipino,
Dorote, guy who's been killing people like
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sessions lauded his efforts to clean up
the Philippines.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking ominous, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not too good when you got
someone basically going for the mass
[SPEAKER_09]: murder record.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was some disturbing imagery that came
out of that of people just getting blown
[SPEAKER_09]: away on the streets.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a level of prohibition that,
wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them might have even been drug
users.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you're spoiled when you're
worried about what's written in the
[SPEAKER_09]: proposition or the latest release of the
federal licensing, and people are
[SPEAKER_09]: literally getting shot in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that the Philippines
legalized medical marijuana at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_09]: I did indeed hear that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember hearing a friend of mine saying
that he was going to be going there for a
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting, and I said, what now?
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, what now?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, jeez, I sure wouldn't be going
for that meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll stick with Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Even when it was illegal, and they were
bashing them over the skulls, they were
[SPEAKER_09]: still fighting for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are my people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, didn't the Chinese just build about a
$20 billion new highway system in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the Chinese are always building crazy
highway systems in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much they spent on it,
but there's definitely one that goes from
[SPEAKER_09]: close to Kingston all the way into Ochie,
and it's quick compared to how it used to
[SPEAKER_09]: be.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to do this real crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, John, I can tell you a story that
while Tony and I were driving with our
[SPEAKER_09]: partners from Kingston to a property just
past Ochos Rios, we ended up on that
[SPEAKER_09]: highway late at night, and we ended up
getting to a point where it was blocked
[SPEAKER_09]: off.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a guy standing there,
like a flag guy, and it was late,
[SPEAKER_09]: like dark late.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we pull up, and I'm like,
damn, we're going to have to go back.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be so long.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Tony and I are kind of huffing and
puffing a bit, and our partner's like,
[SPEAKER_09]: don't worry.
[SPEAKER_09]: He gets out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He kind of pays this guy off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy moves the cone, and we drive
through this rubble and work fully under
[SPEAKER_09]: construction highway.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're now driving through the
construction, driving, driving,
[SPEAKER_09]: driving for about 20 minutes, and we end
up at a dead end.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all rubble, and this little car we're
in can't drive over.
[SPEAKER_09]: The rubble, maybe a big truck could,
but the car can't.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we try to figure out turning around.
[SPEAKER_09]: We go back to where the flag guy is,
and my business partner who's driving the
[SPEAKER_09]: car basically does a U-turn onto the other
side of the highway, which is the wrong
[SPEAKER_09]: side of the highway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we drive the rest of the way down the
wrong side of the highway, going like 120
[SPEAKER_09]: kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was definitely a pretty wild ride.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a wild experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was before that highway got finished.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was nuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like a Disneyland ride that I
went on once.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were calling me.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were just like, listen, it's not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the end, it really wasn't,
but we didn't understand that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were kind of like, this seems like this
is a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but going down the highway the
wrong way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Lo and behold, they were right,
and they got us there totally safely
[SPEAKER_09]: without any weird experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: But holy shit, that was insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Jamaica, honestly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you take taxis for super long distance
rides there, too?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any car will be a taxi.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just a matter of knowing the
prices, because obviously, if you're just
[SPEAKER_09]: a tourist, well, then that's a valuable
opportunity for people who don't make a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of money to maybe make a little bit of
money off of you, because that's what
[SPEAKER_09]: tourism is.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Jamaica, I think it's one of the
biggest ways that money comes to the
[SPEAKER_09]: island.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'd have to probably be there for a
while and really understand how to jump
[SPEAKER_09]: into a cab and just go an hour and a half
up the road or whatever for a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, did you see the new IACM that came
out today about CBD reduces blood pressure
[SPEAKER_06]: in healthy people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I swallow two huge capsules of it every
single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing that for about seven
months now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my blood pressure, I used to be on
four blood pressure medicines,
[SPEAKER_03]: because my atrium is enlarged and I have
an enlarged heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm down to two plus an occasional
other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you that the only real
thing that's constantly consuming CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm all with CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: That particular study, I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the great thing, it's Oxford.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is done at Oxford.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is not not messing around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a study of nine healthy male
volunteers, a single dose of 600
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams of CBD significantly reduced
blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Researchers at Nottingham and Oxford
discovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did this one in my own ass, which is
even more important to me than Oxford.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand this is for the other people,
not your ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for clarifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, local stuff, literally backing
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I met my entire body, but OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I have funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a firm believer in human lower humor,
lower your blood pressure as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Update on Tasha's son from Young Visionary
in 1985.
[SPEAKER_09]: He says he's been in a coma for four
months, was attacked by another inmate.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in jail for having 65 pounds in his
trunk, supposedly in 2013, supposedly,
[SPEAKER_09]: supposedly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm bummed out for the 65 pounds and I am
bummed out that he had to spend even a day
[SPEAKER_09]: in jail for that florist.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, imagine if that was 65 pounds of
roses, how absurd that would sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the cops turned in 65 pounds,
I wonder how much was actually there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen them do anything honest
with regards to seizing pot and arresting
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't expect them to any time soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: True, true, true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, I feel pretty good about
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alex said he was going to come back maybe
next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to invite Guild next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make sure Tony's in the room,
try to get Chimera in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: John, you can come back and talk about,
you know, just get this conversation
[SPEAKER_09]: again, going about the terpenes and the
testing and all of this stuff to me is
[SPEAKER_09]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always excited to learn more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's one of the reasons I do this
every week is so I can sit and listen to
[SPEAKER_09]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And learn more.
[SPEAKER_09]: So give thanks, everyone, on the panel
that was here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Todd McCormick, Johnny B.,
Skunkman Sam, D420K, Alec from SC Labs,
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark Shaldone, who popped in just for a
short time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, Etienne, Skunkman Sam,
and Indra, who are in the room now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And me, the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always happy to spend my Sunday afternoons
and mornings with you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we'll see you tomorrow for The
Waking.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Waking Bake episode, I don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It climbs much faster than Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's around 69 now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe something Jimi Hendrix tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: What if six were a nine?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll leave you with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go on, guys.
Thanks.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on, guys.
