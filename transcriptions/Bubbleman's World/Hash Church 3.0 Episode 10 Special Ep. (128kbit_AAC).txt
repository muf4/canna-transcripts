[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, working helps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's episode 10 today,
our special episode of Hash Church 3.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's wait to go live here on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're live, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, everyone, for Hash Church 3.0.
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 10, but also the special episode,
an episode where we'll be discussing our
[SPEAKER_04]: fallen friend, Horatio, our fallen
soldier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of sad times, too, as Etienne
was just mentioning, gathering today for,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to celebrate the life of Horatio
Delbert, one of our Hash Church alumni.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always came on church and shared his
information and got everyone kind of amped
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was always doing things that was
different than most of the things everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: else was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another thing that I really
appreciated about Horatio.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to welcome Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear my voice coming out of someone's
computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make sure this is me, you,
Ted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to welcome Etienne,
our another Hash Church alumni.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love to the spirit and love that was
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needless to say, his spirit was enduring
and changed and made a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people excited about what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was helping people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of what we do is just
try to do our best to help people and
[SPEAKER_02]: spread love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really hit me hard the other day
because his birthday came up on my
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of hit because he didn't
reach 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's yeah, it's just humbling
all the way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a reminder to live,
laugh and love and hug those that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't care about and give them love and
spread love and joy and do the best you
[SPEAKER_02]: can in these dark times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have bong rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have bong rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bong rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bong rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome, Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're here gathering for a Hash
Church episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always happy to gather with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of a sad episode today
to be celebrating the life of a friend
[SPEAKER_04]: who's passed away, who did some great
things in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just thought, you know, even though
I hadn't really spoken with Horatio for
[SPEAKER_04]: probably a year or two even, I still felt
the need to honor him on the platform,
[SPEAKER_04]: what he shared on the platform and all the
people that he touched.
[SPEAKER_04]: Felt pretty important to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a part of his GoFundMe that raised
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: really, you know, there he is right there,
as I mentioned his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a crazy timing that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really kind of went above and beyond,
as John often does, you know, supporting
[SPEAKER_04]: the family and being there for the family
and making sure that I knew about what was
[SPEAKER_04]: going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some other key people while it was
being kept very, very sort of on the low.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not going to be discussing what
happened to Horatio today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please don't anyone ask what happened
to Horatio.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are just going to celebrate the life of
Horatio.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to get into the depths of
exactly what happened because a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people have been asking that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I feel blessed, John,
for sharing it all with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very glad that you've been there
to support the family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do everything that you can for them
and help with the GoFundMe and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as always, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, pal.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing this morning?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing great, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for all the kind words.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I just I've been I've been there
helping the family out totally with
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just it's what I could do to help a
brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll join you on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sam, Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, my friend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm barely alive, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, first of all, when you told me that
you had covid, it blew me away because I
[SPEAKER_04]: think I've known you for like 20 some odd
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think I've ever known you to
be sick ever at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you get sick?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got very slightly ill in Barcelona at
the cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when when we almost died.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't even know that when you say
that, that's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like your wife was in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been sicker in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got a tiny bit sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you did it after we left Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I never even saw you sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to be honest with covid,
I was sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it from my wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I was sick for 24 hours and then sick
as a dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the next day it was 85 percent gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next day, 90 percent gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was over.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really speaks to your immune system,
Sam, because that's some next level crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're not a young man,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're you're getting up there in age.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's amazing that you just
overweight and then below fucking geezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't want to go too deep into
it, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you for surviving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was that freaked me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ariane got it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Ariane was in bed and going through
his covid experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: His experience was he made it pretty real.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool how he kind of went
through what his condition was.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started jogging and he talked about the
rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened with him?
[SPEAKER_05]: He started really explaining what to do
and really getting to the people like,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, when you get it, stay home,
try and build your immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even know if that works right
now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm glad you're OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, and I hope I hope the wife is going
to be OK as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't eat for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in bed for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't smoke for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 50 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you know that that shit was was
real.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Sam didn't smoke for 24 hours,
that was probably I'd say 20 hours longer
[SPEAKER_04]: than he's ever gone without a puff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was kind of one time and I barely
smoked it all in China, but I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can picture you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can picture you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly how you did it,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to go into it in detail,
but I can picture it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome to the Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh is in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got stung by a bee the other day,
so I kind of have a little bit of a stung
[SPEAKER_13]: eye.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got stung by a bee on your face.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: A wasp just like fucking came out and just
directly bit me like right here and right
[SPEAKER_13]: on the eyelid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say there's no there's no
way a bee bit you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your vibes are too high for a bee,
but a wasp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think wasps fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of wasp friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do sting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But bites sting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get it on your face,
I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a lot of bears on the property.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's a lot of bears on the
property.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Skye's got these crazy bike jumps out
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the bee like the wasps made a huge
nest in his berms.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I came out in the morning and there
was this giant like hole dug out of the
[SPEAKER_13]: berms.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like all these bees flying
around.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, oh, shit, I'm going to go check
this out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had my camera with him like,
oh, I'm going to film.
[SPEAKER_13]: This and I walk up to film it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they just fucking attacked me.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just came out as a bang right in the
eye.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, well, usually the wasps
are really awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can just be like, hey,
I'm here.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when their house gets ripped out of
the ground by a bear, they're just they're
[SPEAKER_13]: pissed off.
[SPEAKER_13]: So oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bear opened that up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we had a bear, a mama and two cubs
in the tree.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think she dug it out with her two
cubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the same thing in Lions Bay right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were in my neighbor's yard yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two cubs and a mama just cruising around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you know, black bears.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Squamish has had grizzly bear hanging out
for the last month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they finally were like, yeah,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: As cool as we are, we got to get rid of
this grizzly bear because this thing's 700
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds and it can literally eat people out
of their cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to put it in a, you know,
trap it and bring it up north,
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect, up to the Yalacum Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we've had some grizzlies in our
community here recently over the last few
[SPEAKER_13]: years.
[SPEAKER_13]: And recently we've had a couple grizzlies
in the community.
[SPEAKER_13]: They act a lot different than the black
bears.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're really awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're still cool here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Mark, what's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Doc.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_13]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just chilling out, trying to stay
uninfected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then don't go to Sam's place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was beautiful words that you wrote
about Horatio the other day in the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: church there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was quite taken aback.
[SPEAKER_04]: By those words.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, I know we had our own discussion,
but it was, it was nice to see,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he, uh, he was a very,
I'll never forget the first time I met
[SPEAKER_04]: Horatio through Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: John was, you know, John's always like
excited, like a kid in a candy store.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's like excited, like a kid in
a candy store.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's legitimately like, you can't be upset
with John because his, his, his excitement
[SPEAKER_04]: is that of a small child.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is so excited about whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he came to me this time and he was
like, dude, I met this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing extractions with limonene.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like terpene extractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to try it with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like beyond excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I'm kind of like,
he gives me some and I've kind of put it
[SPEAKER_04]: on my desk and I'm like, I'm not touching
that fucking shady shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can just, I'll just leave it right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then time kind of went by and I was
kind of like, I was looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this stuff does kind of look
crazy.
It's fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that crazy smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So finally I took a dab of this shit and
it was definitely the early inception of
[SPEAKER_04]: Horatio's, of his extractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure it was Dr. Mark who helped
him figure out how to distill out the
[SPEAKER_04]: citrus oils, the 5% citrus oils that show
up in a five gallon tub of D limonene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are, if you watch the inner
sanctum with Horatio and I, that's where I
[SPEAKER_04]: did my first solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually had me pour the limonene
through the tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba Kush right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the D limonene right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the very first one he made is actually
sitting on my desk in my office.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was with Medi Kush, which was
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, like you said Mark, I first met
Horatio at Ignite Smoke Shop through
[SPEAKER_05]: Brandon and in the basement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, you got to meet this
guy downstairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, just like amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that's how I met Horatio was
through Brandon, through Ignite Smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: Shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rihanna.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rihanna, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went down there and like,
this guy's all about research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like you are John, you got to go down
and talk to this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went down there and like,
I am John.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I'd be making these
extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, oh, I need to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he found me through Jim Frayer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember Jim?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, he did.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so Jim and I were on an Adam Dunn
show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, I want to say like right around
just before 420 and 2014.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so Horatio had reached out to me and I
don't even think he knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and I barely used Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I didn't barely use Facebook,
but I didn't use it really to reach out
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of to the cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was one of the first people to sort of
reached out to me and just started asking
[SPEAKER_10]: all kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it turned into a relationship where I
gave him some background references on how
[SPEAKER_10]: to purify limonene because he had been
getting it from maybe not too profitable
[SPEAKER_10]: sources.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was really a lot of question
around, you know, well, what is this,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, the intended use for?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it is used in foods, you know,
and derived from citrus, the citrus
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is filled with all kinds of nasty
shit in a technical grade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they have like an 85% grade and
there's 15% other stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was simultaneous with having the
discussions around THCA crystallization,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is I went back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus, you know what this really did?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so cool to do this, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went back and I listened to every hash
church up to the hash church where I had
[SPEAKER_10]: first signed in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Horatio had been like texting me
during hash church, like not texting,
[SPEAKER_10]: but sending me a Facebook messenger things
on, hey, Tony is saying this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony is saying this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Having me like, you know, check up on what
Tony was saying because Tony was on hash
[SPEAKER_10]: church.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, he's like, you should
come on and talk about terpenes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my first episode was episode 19.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went back and watched it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you had just come back from Amsterdam,
I think, or Jamaica, no, Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, because hash church 18,
your episode was going over to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you were over there for a week
and then you're in the airport in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just me and Horatio at first on
that episode, episode number 19.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was my first episode on hash
church.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it kind of forced me to go back and
look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it also looked, I went back and looked
at this long messenger thread that we had.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, my gosh, he would just
spill his guts about all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know there was a little bit of a
falling out there for some times.
[SPEAKER_10]: He had a falling out with Kenny.
[SPEAKER_10]: He thought that Kenny, Tricone Kenny,
was going to suit him for some thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't exactly recall.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Terps.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny how it all connects.
[SPEAKER_10]: He unloaded like a three page,
you know, just, ah, I just don't know what
[SPEAKER_10]: to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I can't really,
you know, I have to think about myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just like, hey, man,
just keep doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, stay pure to what you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, like I was saying in my
Facebook post, his last message to me,
[SPEAKER_10]: which was about a year and a half ago,
it was like a little incoherence.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like didn't really make sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't really know what he was talking
about, but I knew he was going through
[SPEAKER_10]: some, some difficult times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was too bad about Kay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've always liked Kay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still like Kay.
[SPEAKER_04]: He still won't talk to me over the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was Kay that called me and he
said, listen, I have a gold nugget.
[SPEAKER_04]: For you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he was working with Shulgin.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was doing the terpene extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had already posted the picture of
Shulgin smelling the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: that classic picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent me a message or called me
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, listen, you need to figure
out how to get the terpenes out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble water, distill them down and get
them back into your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was kind of like, I was like,
do I like, do I need to do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of, you know, he was like,
listen, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want you to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did not have time to do such a thing
and was not in a position to do such a
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I told literally two people about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told Tony and I told Horatio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were the two people that brought
terpenes to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kay was pissed about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, he was really mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the text he sent me, I had to delete
off my phone because they were so harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he told me he had a patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: His patent was for every method of terpene
extraction from cannabis whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It covered everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very much not like Kay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't, it didn't sound,
I've known Kay for 20 years at this point
[SPEAKER_04]: in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was the first time I ever had a
disagreement with him, let alone,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I send him a message probably every
six months saying, Hey bro, I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: about you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He still won't message me back over this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was so angry that that Tony was able to
create a success with his terpenes and
[SPEAKER_04]: that Horatio was creating terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and for me, I look back and I think,
well, man, you could have just come out
[SPEAKER_04]: and done your terpene thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen him do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: In regards to terpenes since 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, it was a fairly
important, you know, as, as important as
[SPEAKER_04]: it was for Sam to do what he did with the
very few of us that got to learn the
[SPEAKER_04]: modulating effects of terpenes back in
early 2000s in his apartment in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that was, of course, you can always
trace it back to Sam and Sam's not the one
[SPEAKER_04]: crying that everyone took this idea from
him, but it's always seems to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: it always seems to be Sam, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he hit me with the pure
cannabinoids and the pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never seen anything like it,
but it was really Tony and Horatio who
[SPEAKER_04]: made it available to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were suddenly now able to have these
cannabis derived terpenes, hold them in
[SPEAKER_04]: their hands, see them, feel them,
smell them, touch them, consume them,
[SPEAKER_04]: dab them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it is unfortunate that sometimes
we end up in these clashes and I know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Horatio was never in a position
where he was, you know, making so much
[SPEAKER_04]: money that he was just very confident and
secure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for K to have laid that on him,
that he was going to, going to sue him
[SPEAKER_04]: that weighed on Horatio, like a great
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had conversations with him about that,
you know, where I had already gone through
[SPEAKER_04]: like a six year lawsuit with Reinhardt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, all right, Kay,
like bring it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to, you want to do lawsuits?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, I know how to do lawsuits and
that's another, you know, two more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Reinhardt was never on hash church,
but he was certainly a giant part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: hash community and the hash world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he created that machine and that
machine was exactly where the bags were
[SPEAKER_04]: created from RIP to Elden, who was the
gentleman who came up with the bag idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: RIP to Reinhardt who passed away at the
end of 2018 or the end of 2017,
[SPEAKER_04]: right when his patent expired.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, if you can imagine Reinhardt
passed away as his water extraction,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, passed, uh, patent also perished.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to give a shout out to Dr.
Lester Grinspoon, who was also a hash
[SPEAKER_04]: church alumni and made it on here for a
couple of episodes, uh, and obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: lived an incredible life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not quite the same, um,
sad story that it was with, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: Horatio dying at such a young age.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Lester was more than twice
Horatio's age, um, when he passed away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he lived this incredible life.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lived a long life, a fruitful life,
and one that also affected the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry in a very, very deep and
meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just want to shout out all the lost
brothers and sisters, uh, over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and just let them know that we're
thinking of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, regardless of whether we had,
uh, you know, falling out or that we
[SPEAKER_04]: maintain these friendships, you know,
you still can be a big enough person to,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, show respect for these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll say, you know, I have nothing but
respect for Kenny Morrow, uh, K from
[SPEAKER_04]: Triclone Technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to one day be his friend again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally have never stopped being his
friend, but that terpene thing really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really bit him in the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, uh, it's unfortunate,
but it is something that happens in our
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, uh, quite often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll have to, uh, learn how to mature
out of these experiences and bring things
[SPEAKER_04]: back full circle because it's easy to burn
bridges down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot harder to rebuild them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I want to shout out to Dr. Lester
Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was the PTS study in,
uh, marijuana, the forbidden medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, he touched my life back
after the war.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was, uh, willing to put forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all published anonymously, but I am
thanked in the forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that was one of my early access to
self-healing, uh, was to actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, write down my story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd gone around and told it for a few
years, going around being an activist with
[SPEAKER_02]: Canvas Action Network.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fortunate to do rallies in 47
states, you know, got kicked out of Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: with our legal marijuana from LV Muzika,
but, um, Dr. Grinspoon was a force and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he suffered the slings and
arrows, uh, for the things that he
[SPEAKER_02]: published and took a lot of heat for it as
a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I look around at a whole bunch of
other pioneers here, we all know,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately, the painful piercings that
can happen when you tread where nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: else has tread and tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Dr. Grinspoon definitely deserves
an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul did the darkest of ages and pushed
forward with his life for all of us to see
[SPEAKER_02]: and giving me a shoulder to stand on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, needless to say, it was beyond
humbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I kind of want to give a shout out to,
uh, cause I've been doing my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, veteran healing shout out to the
Veterans Access Initiative, Rico and
[SPEAKER_02]: Pearson and, uh, Veterans Virtual Happy
Hour, Jose and them on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been keeping me sane during this
COVID stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're working actually behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some really cool stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did y'all know that the Compassionate IND
program, or at least the Investigative New
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug program was reopened by the United
States government due to Epidiolex?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so what we're going to try to do
is we're going to try to, uh, reaccess
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, take veterans through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get, uh, access again, be it most
likely from importation as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: getting that crappy Mississippi weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, look out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming out as a force.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Epilex is made out of a CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: I developed a license to GW.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you did because you're the master
and thank you very much for what you did
[SPEAKER_02]: because, uh, I have not tried Epidiolex,
but at the same time, it's creation,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and due to set of exes failure allowed
the IND program to reopen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that's huge for patients who want
access to Investigative New Drugs because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was shut down in the early nineties due
to, uh, a Congress person basically saying
[SPEAKER_02]: because a bunch of AIDS patients were
signing up that people were trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, get access to the program so
they could spread AIDS around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they think they have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the access to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they shut down the program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert Randall helped arrange for the AIDS
patients to make those applications for
[SPEAKER_06]: the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who don't know, Robert
Randall was the first person to win the
[SPEAKER_02]: right to have access to medical cannabis
from the United States government grown at
[SPEAKER_02]: the University of Mississippi in Oxford.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Al Soli and them are still at it,
but maybe through this program we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: them to grow some good weed finally by
importing from either Israel or some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these other countries that will force
them, even Canadian weed, which would be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to import for the Combash IND
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which would you recommend as
an access from of your Canadian weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend to us,
American veterans, companies, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_13]: We would recommend regenerative hemp or
cannabis grown organically because we find
[SPEAKER_13]: that the chemicals that are often used in
the grow can affect, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: the mind space of the medicine afterwards.
[SPEAKER_13]: So especially with, uh, you know,
you know, people from the military and
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff, and there, there are more people in
our area and the Coudneys that have been
[SPEAKER_13]: licensed recently that could provide you
with some of that medicine, which is,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to say somewhat new.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, the, the licensed
producer program here in Canada has not
[SPEAKER_13]: been set up to really produce like,
you know, let's say intentional medicine
[SPEAKER_13]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I would love to,
to hook you up with a couple of people in
[SPEAKER_13]: our area and see if it would work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the problems in Canada with
organics as well, just like it's the same
[SPEAKER_04]: problem in California and the Salinas
Valley is that trying to grow organically
[SPEAKER_04]: while everyone else is bombing avid and
malathion on their avocados and their
[SPEAKER_04]: raspberries and blueberries makes it damn
near impossible to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really have to make sure you choose
your farm position wisely and also
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially hope to control your
neighbor's farms if they're being farmed
[SPEAKER_04]: or if they're being sold to people coming
in to, with the intention of farming,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the amount of people who grow,
um, conventionally, which is the word they
[SPEAKER_04]: use for poison, um, is just astronomical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is absolutely astronomical how many
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've seen this, we've seen organic
cannabis fail, um, pesticides and just,
[SPEAKER_04]: and without ever having sprayed a single
pesticide on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's kind of disconcerting
when you think of the energy and the time
[SPEAKER_04]: and the, and what it takes to do it in the
right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also with health Canada, not really
allowing, uh, kind of like the U S was
[SPEAKER_04]: there where microbial counts, you were
failing in microbial counts, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they weren't necessarily the microbes
that were the negative microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these things have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I, you know, like obviously in
health Canada's programs, you're not
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to have this sort of full closed
loop, like have goats shitting over there
[SPEAKER_04]: and have like, you know, your compost up,
like it's very, very structured and very
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully, you know, people like Josh
and Kelly can have an influence and that
[SPEAKER_04]: more and more people, I think the way to
talk to these people is through the words
[SPEAKER_04]: terroir and Appalachia and understand that
we can't scrub those things out of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis the way we haven't scrubbed them
out of the wine industry and out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: grape industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever considered, uh, offering that
to the wine industry, Hey, let's scrub the
[SPEAKER_04]: terroir out, grow in aseptic rooms with
lights and nutrients, salt nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see what kind of, uh,
what kind of wine we get out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that community would be like in an
uproar and say, well, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the most important thing when
we grow our grapes next to the genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves is the terroir in which we
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if the Canadian cannabis program
health Canada can start understanding the
[SPEAKER_04]: value of terroir and how it applies to
cannabis, we may very well get to that
[SPEAKER_04]: place that, uh, that you're already at
Josh.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two different crops though,
Marcus, because, uh, grapes are grown in
[SPEAKER_06]: native earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis very little cannabis grown
outdoors is actually grown in native
[SPEAKER_06]: earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost all of it is in bags or manmade
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the case of, in the case of the
regenerative farmers and, and even some of
[SPEAKER_13]: the licensed, two of the licensed farmers
in our area, they are growing in native
[SPEAKER_13]: soil and they are growing outdoor
varietals.
[SPEAKER_13]: And with the help of some of the genetic,
uh, research going on with like Daryl
[SPEAKER_13]: Hudson and Atlanta and all that there's,
um, hemp that's being, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: tested still, um, outdoors and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: That can finish out here because as we've
stated before, Kelly and I have personally
[SPEAKER_13]: grown out a lot of the hemp variety,
almost all of the hemp varietals.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you can't say all, but a shitload
of them have, we've tried to grow them
[SPEAKER_13]: outdoors out here and it's, they just
don't come, they just don't finish and
[SPEAKER_13]: they don't have the same flavor or the
same profiles.
[SPEAKER_13]: So getting an outdoor varietal that works
out here that's also registered in the
[SPEAKER_13]: Canadian hemp, um, uh, bracket is,
is, is, is still in process.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's say since the license producers
here in Canada have somewhat had a failed
[SPEAKER_13]: run, you know, and the Canadian government
is seeing, you know, how, how this isn't
[SPEAKER_13]: working.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's change coming to our community
and, and, and, uh, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_13]: people that are looking at making changes
and maybe ATM or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can like talk to some, to the Canadian
people about like what California has done
[SPEAKER_13]: with microbials and California only tests
for human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm correct, um, which are,
you know, like E.
[SPEAKER_13]: coli and botulism as a botulism and
listeria.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could maybe name off all of them,
but, uh, and I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: using human pathogens as a, as a,
you know, um, something to test for and
[SPEAKER_13]: heavy metals, that kind of makes sense to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have a question because of the soil,
not everybody can prep their soil
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have veterans of this and a lot of
people ask me, what's the best over the
[SPEAKER_02]: counter soil that's on the market that you
would recommend for cannabis growers that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have access to do what you beautiful
people do up at dragon flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others that actually prep their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend as an over the
counter soil that you could add to,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera?
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I mean, I like, I like build a soil
lot.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they have a lot of options for,
for the, the home grower.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, they also offer some, some cover crop,
um, solutions for you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, I think that's a good way to
start.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there's also super soil recipes
online that you can easily look up,
[SPEAKER_16]: um, and mix and match your favorite
amendments from, you know, such as,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the Dempure offerings that you
have, you can mix your own soils pretty
[SPEAKER_16]: easily.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and it doesn't really require much
space to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're doing, you know, a small grow
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd, I'd highly recommend that,
um, for anyone out there to, to really get
[SPEAKER_16]: into the soil biology and biome of,
of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so, and I wanted to interject on what
Josh was saying about growing at scale
[SPEAKER_16]: with, with, you know, regenerative
practices in upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_16]: there's a 2,600 acre farm that is
rotational with 30 acres of hemp on it and
[SPEAKER_16]: all we do on that farm is, is
regeneratively using cover crop.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we, we, you know, we,
it's in a rotation, uh, with other crops.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, it's very much on a schedule,
much like a conventional farm would
[SPEAKER_16]: actually run their schedules.
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the inputs are actually forged
from the land itself.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also doing carbon sequestering and things
of that nature.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think what I've seen over that time
working with that project, I've seen,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, a lot of trials and
tribulations, but I now feel it,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, it's really, it's plausible to
do this large scale.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe that that is something
that we can all look towards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just sitting here talking about all
the organic growing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when, uh, ratio here,
started making all the compost piles and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that and adding all the chicken
shit too, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had, like, I'm at his house right
now and he's got all big cement mixers and
[SPEAKER_05]: you should see all the piles of,
they have all the organic growers there
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of his beds that he put out there
because they're growing all their own food
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he really got really into what you
guys are talking about, but he always
[SPEAKER_05]: tried to do it a little different.
[SPEAKER_05]: He always tried to do it his way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always tried to kind of reinvent the wheel
in some way and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I'm just seeing all these piles
of, um, near the hen right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's got all this, uh, tarps over it
and he's, he's, he's getting all this dirt
[SPEAKER_05]: ready for, for spring for next year and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'm going to go there and grab
a bunch of that actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And pile it back in my truck and bring it
to my house today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, because I know he worked a lot on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my first of my living soils
that I'm going to start because I keep
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow some herb and Horatio's soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally going to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see it there as you're talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for talking about that
because I just forgot about what he was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and then now seeing it there,
I'm sort of a little teary-eyed about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, because he's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, and that's, it was,
it's pretty awesome to see just the,
[SPEAKER_05]: what, what we always put, and he was
always saying the turps, we got to get
[SPEAKER_05]: those turps going.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was always about the turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he knew that the generative way was
how they were going to get the best turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and then he went into hydro and
I'm going through all this hydro gear
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, he literally tried reinventing
growing guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, he's the spinners and all
these tubes and this, and it was,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, and he was always trying to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and when regenerative soils come into
play here and all these living soils and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that, like the flavors that
we're getting from the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and really it's, um, it's,
it's really cool to, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: talk more about that, about trying to get
those turps, trying to look at that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that whole natural thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what Horatio was all about was,
was all about natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't want any chemicals in anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if he did an extraction that had
anything that was sprayed on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: he would, he'd give it back to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you can't spray anything on
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had powdery mildew, so it's not
working.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, it was, um, he was always chasing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and I saw the soils as you're
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we really got to give back
is by growing and getting those turps and
[SPEAKER_05]: living what you love to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll tell you, we have it all on
record, you know, like there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: Horatio recordings on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, there's a lot of all of you
guys on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all going to have meet our maker one
day and pass on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all have done a ton of different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the amount of time and energy and
talking and sharing that you guys have
[SPEAKER_04]: done here on this platform, uh,
will, will and should live on for a very
[SPEAKER_04]: long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have them all backed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've removed them all at, you know,
copied them all off of, uh, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're secure on multiple hard drives.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of it as very, very priceless
information that I never, ever plan to
[SPEAKER_04]: monetize, but always plan to share and
give away and, and make sure that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what a great thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mark said, you can go back and you
can watch literally hours and hours and
[SPEAKER_04]: hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's probably half a dozen to
10 videos with just myself and Horatio,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe Johnny B as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then however many Hash Churches,
I don't know if he was on a hundred or 150
[SPEAKER_04]: or how many Hash Churches he was on,
but he was definitely on more than a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freshly frozen bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, I was saying good things there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you were profound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all wrapped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Horatio's playing games with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I would just, um, add or go
ahead if you want to say something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Horatio is shining his love down on us
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I would add to what was said about all
the soil saying that I agree with
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that's said there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's beautiful that Johnny's being
able to connect with, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: Horatio through the soil and through the
turps and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, there's, there's buying,
there's buying soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, on, you know, line or getting it in
bags and that can be done.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, people will use teas
on top of that to make it really work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of people will shoot for the,
uh, big bud kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: like the, the bodybuilder or whatever,
they go for the big bud rather than the
[SPEAKER_13]: actual depth of the soil and, uh,
and the flavor and the turps.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm going to say is it's really
important to make your own soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's great calling that you,
that you brought up build a soil and
[SPEAKER_13]: making your own soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you make your own soil and even,
you know, veterans or people that have a
[SPEAKER_13]: small amount of space, I think it's really
important to, to look at the components of
[SPEAKER_13]: your soil and what the act of mixing all
that and make, and getting microbes,
[SPEAKER_13]: living microbes and putting that together
is a healing process in itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you start getting your seed
together.
[SPEAKER_13]: You start thinking and connecting with the
soil and, and then the seed and you put
[SPEAKER_13]: the seed in there or a clone, and then you
put that in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I mean, growing isn't an automatic
thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that really is a spiritual
connection.
[SPEAKER_13]: So making your own soil is really the
first part of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And buying dust and powders and stuff
from, from stores is only so alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say going out on a walk and I
want to make this really clear as,
[SPEAKER_13]: and, and selectively grabbing some
inoculants from nature, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: whether it's, and I realize some people
don't live near nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm, I'm, I'm in full awareness that,
you know, not everyone can do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, but the, for the people that
can, you can grab like this small little
[SPEAKER_13]: handful and put it in a bag, a small bag
of leaf duff and leaf matter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's your living organisms and the
living organisms really need something to
[SPEAKER_13]: continue living.
[SPEAKER_13]: So adding a little bit of mulch to that
gives it something to continue living on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the interaction between raw materials
and soil is the living part.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you, a person doesn't have living soils
by buying a bunch of amendments and mixing
[SPEAKER_13]: them together and them being called
biological.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're, they're biological and they're
alive when they're eating something.
[SPEAKER_13]: So top dressing, you know, nettle powder
or alfalfa powder, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever you can get, ganja leaf,
any of your defoliating leaves that are
[SPEAKER_13]: healthy, you could dry out or you could
just drop them right on your soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that feeds the top layer.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know the top layer of soil is the most
active.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want layer of soil once you get
your soil base.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where the depth of terpenes come
from.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where the plant is able to express
itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know the plant is expressing itself and
Mark and different people can talk about
[SPEAKER_13]: the science behind how a plant is able to
be different in an aeroponic situation or
[SPEAKER_13]: a hydroponic or a fully biological rich
soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of, you know,
a lot of people nowadays moving towards,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, using these soils in a
production way and also in a backyard way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, and I just want to really
encourage people to continue with it
[SPEAKER_13]: because it's, it's the future and it's how
we're going to make it into the future.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's how we, you know, are going to be
able to connect with longevity and
[SPEAKER_13]: longevity is missing right now in our
lives in many different areas.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would add, I would add to that Josh.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think your own soil is really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, I would add to that, that if you
want a great book for learning all of
[SPEAKER_04]: this, that's really fun and easy to read.
[SPEAKER_04]: This comic book is like second to none.
[SPEAKER_04]: It blew me away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts with this like Dutch guy and
he's growing, he's growing with salts and
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals and he's looking on the labels
and he's like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff can kill you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he tosses it all away and he starts
learning about organics and he basically
[SPEAKER_04]: goes, they go through the entire book.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nature cycle takes you through like
this beautiful visuals of what's going on
[SPEAKER_04]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening with the cellulose
strategic cocktail room, nitric and citric
[SPEAKER_04]: acids, like all of this complex
information put into a comic book that
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been reading to my son and basically
picking up the knowledge just while I read
[SPEAKER_04]: this to him at bedtime for to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Amazon, freely adapted from the
organic grow book by Carol Schellhut and
[SPEAKER_04]: Michiel Panhusen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put their names up because I didn't
spell them very well and take a little
[SPEAKER_04]: snapshot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also on Kindle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was Alpen Glow that I believe
shared this the first time on a show that
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh and Kelly were doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also Jesse Bio Vortex.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Regenerative Cannabis Farm where Jesse's
got a character in that book and he was in
[SPEAKER_13]: communication with those two.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe France when they were
creating it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's an awesome book.
[SPEAKER_13]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely France.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kids book made, you know, for,
you know, everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also Rodale's Guide to Compost is a really
good base.
[SPEAKER_13]: From the 40s till now, you know that and
they continue to bring information about
[SPEAKER_13]: regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another thing to look into is in your
local community is municipal compost and
[SPEAKER_13]: municipal dirt that's being made in your
area.
[SPEAKER_13]: The issue you might run across and you can
ask them for testing is if there's any
[SPEAKER_13]: roadside sprays or any vegetation that's
been used from say golf courses or
[SPEAKER_13]: something that can contaminate the soils.
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe before you use a local municipal
compost.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Alice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Before you use the municipal compost,
maybe ask them if they have testing for
[SPEAKER_13]: fertilizer residuals or herbicides or
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_13]: So municipal compost is also kind of like
if when it's good, it's a local soil that
[SPEAKER_13]: has organisms from your local area.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we could go on and on about soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: But blessings, Alice, how are you today?
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you holding up in your community?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to see you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry I'm late on a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_11]: I woke up kind of late today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am well.
[SPEAKER_11]: The sun is shining today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been kind of stoked that there's not
that much smoke in the air here in North
[SPEAKER_11]: Cal and pretty excited to see the soil
movie too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you were talking about the soil and I
can't wait to see the kids kiss the
[SPEAKER_11]: ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys were talking about this before.
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone seen it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Flynn's here with me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to join in a minute and just
want to say happy Sunday to you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, welcome, Alice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to have you guys both here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we wanted to definitely talk a
little bit about the fires today as well
[SPEAKER_04]: and how that's affecting everyone down
along the West Coast and how we can kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of point people in the direction of the
right ways to offer help.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on an email chain with Josh and Kelly
from Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may very well be on it as well,
Alice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't look at the names, but yeah,
it was nice to see all these people just
[SPEAKER_04]: offering help and whatever it is,
no matter how small it's offered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, look, this is what I can
offer and this is what I will offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that makes you feel good when it's not
people using each other as ladders to
[SPEAKER_04]: climb on top of one another to get to the
top, but they're actually helping each
[SPEAKER_04]: other and putting a hand down to lift
someone up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the kind of communities I want
to be involved with.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And during this time of political turmoil
and environmental turmoil, there's just a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of divisive potential out there who's
going which direction and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even in the cannabis space,
we've talked about it, it can be a
[SPEAKER_13]: competitive space because people are
trying to make it work with ideas and all
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what we've really done within our
community is just really bring in the
[SPEAKER_13]: supportive aspect and realize that all
coming up together is a success.
[SPEAKER_13]: And part of the success is just supporting
each other.
[SPEAKER_13]: So during this fire situation,
I mean, it's been a long, like almost a
[SPEAKER_13]: month now of problems with fires in Oregon
and California.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some people have been awoken at night
not knowing there was a fire like the ones
[SPEAKER_13]: in Oregon recently and definitely
California too.
[SPEAKER_13]: But as far as Oregon goes, a lot of those
fires started during that night of wind
[SPEAKER_13]: where it was 70 miles an hour wind and
people didn't even know there was a fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the time the fire came,
it just engulfed everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was we know there was one person
that there's a bunch of people that got
[SPEAKER_13]: burnt up in their houses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of our close family members ran
out of his house and his neighbor woke him
[SPEAKER_13]: up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he went out with two different socks
and his underwear.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you hear a lot of these stories.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he lost everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's a cannabis grower for 20 years on
the coast of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: They love his shelter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he lost all of his clothes he's been
working on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And our family members in Portland and Meg
and Liz and Pat and a bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_13]: Casey helped get a lot of his strains back
to him because he gave plans to people in
[SPEAKER_13]: the Portland area and they were flowering
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people went to their houses
[SPEAKER_13]: to get back to him so he could continue
his journey of breathing and get his life
[SPEAKER_13]: back together.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's working on court cases right now
against the electric companies because
[SPEAKER_13]: electricity went out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the fire, I don't know what's
right and wrong with electricity.
[SPEAKER_13]: But electricity is a big thing that's
killing us when it comes to massive fires.
[SPEAKER_13]: So wires go down and fires start.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no forestry management that's
going to stop that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We go on and on about managing and all
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So another thing is actively at the moment
in Trinity County Flower Days Farm,
[SPEAKER_13]: is super nervous about a fire that's in
their area.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll say a few things that we don't
know for sure, but there are backfires and
[SPEAKER_13]: fires getting started to burn back the
fire and drones maybe starting fires to
[SPEAKER_13]: stop the fire from growing and burning out
some people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like a level of insanity going on
around there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people just don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you just wake up every minute of
the day looking which way the wind's
[SPEAKER_13]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Wade, maybe you can talk about some of
the links that you know about.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Rio and Alpenlo and Gil, Ganja Gil and
Walter from Soul Spirit, Holly Hall and
[SPEAKER_13]: Crystal, a bunch of other people.
[SPEAKER_13]: But those people have said like,
hey, Carla and Jacob, we got you covered.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a truck.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got the last tows.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a pump.
[SPEAKER_13]: What food do you need?
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on our way right now today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe it was yesterday in the
afternoon, but it's like right now where
[SPEAKER_13]: they're bringing over a total support crew
for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would just say, we have our network
because you can only have what network you
[SPEAKER_13]: have.
[SPEAKER_13]: But people are really willing to help one
another.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really important to band together
and also to help protect each other
[SPEAKER_13]: because insane people are out there and
take this opportunity to prey on your
[SPEAKER_13]: property.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you're evacuating, reality is true.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to fucking guard your property,
too, because assholes are coming to
[SPEAKER_13]: fucking steal things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: So be diligent and strong and,
you know, use your community.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I just want to give special
love to the peer certified community and
[SPEAKER_13]: all the people that are beyond that that
are helping people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the fires are crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wade, do you have any input on that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you've had a lot of input.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Valerie Corral in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, a big love to Brett and Dos Paros,
who did lose his home completely.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and I know Valerie right now,
you know, has said that her all of the
[SPEAKER_13]: floors based on her and her house is taken
up by people who have lost their homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Foxworthy, Foxworthy Farms,
who supports us in Berkeley, Martin O
[SPEAKER_02]: 'Brien, and he just lost his house and
part of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it was saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the winds are so random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's it survives and what
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much love to Valerie and everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they had a very challenging
luncheon time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard they.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he mute himself right at the end there
or was that just what was the last thing
[SPEAKER_13]: you said?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I heard that Valerie Valerie's
farm was saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't know at first, and it was like
one of those things like, oh, what's up?
[SPEAKER_13]: But they from what I know at this moment,
it is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a lot of confusion and
even she didn't know when I saw her
[SPEAKER_02]: posting on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I heard through the rumor control that,
you know, it was saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to hear confirmation is great to hear,
although I know there's definitely damage,
[SPEAKER_02]: etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And expect a lot of smoky Kush and hickory
Kush on the East Coast this year,
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chipotle bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say it again, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it Chipotle bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like, oh, there's something
weird with this bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh, that's like wildfires
bubble.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be the chipotle sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just got this smoky flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not, that's not funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not funny, but it is like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just pray and I pray and I pray that
2021 doesn't say to 2020 hold my beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have to understand because the cat,
they planned his resonance, all that smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: debris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticks to the plants and kind of gets into
it and you can't wash it off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So unlike fruit, you know, but I think
they could just turn it into distillate,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause they could, they could clean up
distillates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what they have to do,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only, you know, yeah,
a lot of those, you know, and it's nice to
[SPEAKER_13]: have an option, but a lot of those people
are grilled, you know, it's, they're all
[SPEAKER_13]: organic growers and the thing they're
like, oh sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just made an isolate.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, it's not really very
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that sense, you know, but from the
farmers point of view, uh, turning if your
[SPEAKER_00]: business model, if you will, is set up on
the idea of being able to sell high end
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed flowers that people consume by
smoking, uh, you've got a price point
[SPEAKER_00]: that's considerably different than what's
usually offered for material that ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: being distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really significant difference in
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and what's true about the fires
this year is it's really a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tragedy all across California and across
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's kind of a, to me,
it's a, like Marcus was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hold my beer cause more is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what happened here with fires back in
August was early in August around the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth or the ninth, one night,
a line of thunderstorms, blue and red,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, from south to north along the length
of California, mostly along the coast
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were like 12,000 lightning
strikes at the beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was bone dry and literally
thousands of fires started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them were clumped, like I said,
along the coast range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think I've saw that,
uh, on Cal fire's website, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, um, and this was like a week
ago, we had 26 times the amount of acreage
[SPEAKER_00]: has burned so far this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we're early in the fire season,
26 times more has burned this year than
[SPEAKER_00]: burned last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think there's, I know that this is
overhyped in the news a lot and certainly
[SPEAKER_10]: things that we should be concerned about,
but do you think there's a direct
[SPEAKER_10]: correlation to climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, climate change and, um, large areas
that, um, to be speak plainly belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: either large property owners and,
or the U S government or state
[SPEAKER_00]: governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no funding to do any sort of
forest management other than cutting trees
[SPEAKER_00]: for lumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60% of California is, is, is federal
forest land on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also, as Wade is talking,
there's also been not proper burning for
[SPEAKER_02]: decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's unfortunately a lot of fuel out
there on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sudden oak death has also caused problems
throughout forests because you've have
[SPEAKER_02]: certain trees dying in certain areas and
those are dry tinder, which only,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're spotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here in the Sierra Nevada,
they didn't mean to interrupt their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pine beetle.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: The eucalyptus as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's, that's a highly, highly flammable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is worse now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is worse now for all the reasons you
guys are saying, but let's be perfectly
[SPEAKER_06]: frank in August.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the natural cycle of the forest in
California that lightning strike burns
[SPEAKER_06]: down huge areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a hundred years to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been going on for thousands and
thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: NAM is what stuck his houses in the middle
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, you know, a little farm at a
thousand meters in the Sierra Nevada's
[SPEAKER_00]: near grass valley, Nevada city area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love part of why I came here is
there's so many beautiful trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have huge, huge chestnuts and oak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have four on a four acre
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four oaks that are 120 feet tall
and bigger than our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a main, an amazing amount of
acorns dropping this year as a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: fact, but back to fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done is a pretty serious effort
of fire safe clearing as it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really satisfied the
requirements, but you kind of live with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that as Josh was saying at any
moment, particularly on a windy night or
[SPEAKER_00]: day, all of a sudden there's smoke in the
air and you've got literally a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to get your shit together and be
ready to leave because you might get
[SPEAKER_00]: burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's real about that is it's
actually happened to a number of people we
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of us who haven't not had that
and we are in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a couple of fires in our
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big one north of us is happening in the
same area where the fire two years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: killed 80 some people in the town of
paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a fire that was started by PG
&E's electrical transmission system
[SPEAKER_00]: failing in a river Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hangers on a high tension wire
broke and cascade of sparks and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: windy morning about five o'clock and by
seven o'clock the town of paradise was on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody that was in it that didn't
make it out is one of those 88 dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all live with that idea that that
could happen at any moment, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: for those of us that live in an urban or
excuse me, the wild lands, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the where like myself, I live in a whole
bunch of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, fire happens here, just like Sam
was saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one of the things you can do besides
a fire break is to have tile roofs and
[SPEAKER_06]: have a brick or stone exterior walls of
your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are almost impossible to burn.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another really good thing to do is a lot
of the conifer trees and things that are
[SPEAKER_13]: right directly around your home.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot have those a conifer tree right
around your home and then have more grassy
[SPEAKER_13]: or garden areas right around your home.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then putting a sprinkler on the peak
of your roof and hard plumbing in like
[SPEAKER_13]: with maybe a metal conduit spring like
sprinklers on the top of your roof and
[SPEAKER_13]: turn them on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's like a wall of water coming
down your roof.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of people have been able to save
their homes with fire just going right
[SPEAKER_13]: around their house.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I'm a little nervous that
everyone's just like, oh, we got to cut
[SPEAKER_13]: all of the branches and trees down in
order to save ourselves from fires.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to encourage people
instead of burning off your branches,
[SPEAKER_13]: consider digging them into the earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consider putting those branches around
your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to burn anyway from the
sparks in the air.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to speak with Collins was finding any
excavator or someone and dig them into the
[SPEAKER_13]: earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eucalyptus trees are not only a problem,
they're an inundation problem because
[SPEAKER_02]: California brought in a whole bunch of
eucalyptus back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 27 different varietals here and
they're not indigenous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought them because they wanted them
to grow paper or grow wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the microbes in the soil
causes the wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just broke up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil also kills everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the oils also, you know,
kill everything below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a combination of trees that
will also full of oil that can explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also a problem in California
that isn't really talked about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eucalyptus also sucks out all the moisture
from the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: And eucalyptus is not good to make a
hugelpile from.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Collin.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was just going to just kind of add
to what you guys were saying.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's an invasive species and it does
need to be managed.
[SPEAKER_16]: And to your point, it's hard to deforest
eucalyptus because it's so invasive.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it's unbelievable how invasive
that species is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazed how people don't talk about
that reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the news touches on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it's so invasive, it's in
every forest and thick and they overtake a
[SPEAKER_02]: great part of where they grow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus, wouldn't you say it's a good time
for a group dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think Johnny B had some of
Horatio's Terp champagne out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going to make a toast maybe and
we'll have a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's in order.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will definitely open this bottle,
but it will be in a room of some special
[SPEAKER_05]: friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Horatio Delbert Concentrates LH
Joe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gave me one of these bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you guys, this is like five years
old, six years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of his first bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to kind of crack it on his
service, but there's going to be a day
[SPEAKER_05]: that we open this bottle in honor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today's not really that morning right
now, but I would like to one day celebrate
[SPEAKER_05]: with this Terp champagne.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember when he came up with the
first Terp champagne.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, Mark, you've tried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought some bottles to my friend's
wedding there back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just an honor to be able to have some
of the first Terp champagne and still be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now I've got this LH Joe on the
end of this dab rig right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get up my Temtek, heat it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started smoking a little bit of this
right up the way there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when this passing happened,
and I got like one left, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep that last one for my last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long rig, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got some nice hatch here from Flav,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Flav421 came on over, Dave, and spent some
time at our house last night.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was super good to see him.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he knows his first time here on the
property.
[SPEAKER_13]: He came out with our buddy Alex,
big love to him and them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they dropped off some nice hash,
some pie face.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some of that pie face.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came here and we squished some pie
face, some Renee, some OG, what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it was Trop Santo crossed
with cookies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, I think that's what this,
I think that's in this one is Dave,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll remind me.
[SPEAKER_05]: LH Joe right now is, I'm just sharing it
with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just dabbing it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been like six years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe the flavor is still there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's old flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was, it was literally made with
Terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you save it in the freezer,
Johnny?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been in the fridge the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I had my little box here,
specialness.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got D420K's first little dry sifty game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got your first dry sift marked on a card
here when you did your first sift for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got everybody's little bit of box in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like all those memories is all on this
little box of trippy stick, trippy stick
[SPEAKER_05]: box even got from you, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I open it up, I got all the little
treasures that we've done over the last
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first that exists from right here
to some of the first Leme to some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: first dabs that we made to all the little
histories of the stuff that we've done
[SPEAKER_05]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when we, when we laughed so hard
after that dab, then it took me 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: to make.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was, that was hilarious,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And laughed our heads off and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it's, uh, yeah, I can't
believe the Terps in there and stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the bang is pretty, you know,
Chaz though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Chaz, your banger.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it the time?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, is it the time for
the, for the, Oh, no, I, Oh, it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we doing a slow starts?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little cold.
[SPEAKER_16]: I did a cold start.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll do a cold start myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do a cold start too.
[SPEAKER_16]: A little quicker.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't do the cold start.
Actually.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I got some, uh, solving this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some good time sitting there on
CCHQ doing dabs with Horatio and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: He pulled out all the dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some great pictures of all of us
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one really good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's a me, Horatio and V420K and,
um, I think Flaus in
[SPEAKER_05]: the background.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you, what are you smoking Alex
and Flynn?
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, now, uh, I just did some 24K to start
the day that orangey vibe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a beautiful, um, strain that I
actually taught from resin wrench brought
[SPEAKER_11]: up and he has this great cut that has
beautiful melt.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me, it's like a morning orange
juice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super creative.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a 24K taffy from, uh, from Joey and
I'm pretty sure he must've made it with
[SPEAKER_13]: Todd during those times when they were at
the Mendo hideout.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's this one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it probably is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It probably is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got some, we're still working on those,
those varietals in that line right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what the taffy was by any
recollection?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this one, it was a test.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I thought too.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's from Brandon and Amanda.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's their papaya punch, their papaya
punch cut.
[SPEAKER_11]: We watched it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_11]: They gifted us the cut and then we watched
it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were doing also actually the,
the melt test here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just check out where is it going to be?
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got, um, the strawberry guava cut from
them and, and the, uh, purple punch cut
[SPEAKER_08]: from them.
[SPEAKER_14]: This guava is insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes it taste as tash I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting ready to make the first bits
of it from our light depth that we did
[SPEAKER_13]: this year and it came out just so good
because British Columbia had a good year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been wanting to get that strain since
Mark put those terpenes underneath my nose
[SPEAKER_05]: when it came out of surgery and it took my
pain away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been asking for it for like five
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if, and if I could get a cut of that or
even try it, like just actually have some
[SPEAKER_05]: of it to see how it affects me again,
it'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hey, Johnny, we're going to get our
trims done here and we're going to take
[SPEAKER_13]: like a big trip out to the coast and we're
going to come visit you and Mark and some
[SPEAKER_13]: of you there spend some time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll, we'll bring you what we have.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just gave a place, some of our
ruffle plant to try and, uh, to clone and
[SPEAKER_13]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: John had literally just gotten out of back
surgery, like neck spinal surgery when,
[SPEAKER_04]: when Dee and I went to, to put that purple
punch under his nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought 30 different terpenes that day
in a, in a, in a Pelican case and sat by
[SPEAKER_04]: his hospital bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a super intense floor of a
hospital.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every single person had these crazy
posts coming out of these casts around
[SPEAKER_04]: their necks, like attaching them to their
beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then John is all like, Hey guys,
Oh, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just like super animated man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course it's all filmed on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there's a video of us, that whole
thing, even what you can see him smell it
[SPEAKER_03]: and be like, Oh my God, that like took my
pain away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pulled it away from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, give that back to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are like in the.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got a very deep, like rich flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's kind of like, I feel like a
little anise or some kind of a,
[SPEAKER_13]: like a deep licorice ish flavor.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm right on that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they made the guava punch Brandon
and Amanda, the guava punch seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those turned out phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I could probably bring you a few of
those seeds if you're interested,
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm always interested in growing and
learning about terms of finding different
[SPEAKER_05]: strains that work for me and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and when, when you find something
that works like cannabis, that's why I
[SPEAKER_05]: preach it so much to everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause shit works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's a no brainer guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, if you're in pain or you're
suffering in any way, or you just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: relax or just like, just, just have a good
time, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that one, that one smell, it was
literally, I would pull it away and go
[SPEAKER_05]: like, and that's when I started looking
at, you know, save the turps, looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: turps means that modulated and how it
helps me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the big thing with Horatio was
the turps means he saw how it helped me so
[SPEAKER_05]: much because Horatio spent a lot of time
coming over to the house and putting
[SPEAKER_05]: transdermal creams on my neck when I first
came out of surgery.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys don't know, they took out
my C4 and C5 vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I really started looking
at how terpenes were helping with my pain
[SPEAKER_05]: because of what Mark brought in and what
Horatio was doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just everything that was happening at
that point of my life really pushed me to
[SPEAKER_05]: know that terpenes was a way of being able
to standardize my medicine by controlling
[SPEAKER_05]: water chase, trying to standardize my
medicine by decarboxylating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Horatio was doing a lot of creams and
stuff like that that helped with healing
[SPEAKER_05]: effects, which I wish we had that one
recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, yeah, now I'm just talking
about, you know, how great cannabis is and
[SPEAKER_05]: how the terpenes helped so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that purple punch was something else,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was definitely, and we talked about
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Hindu Kush has a really nice flavor
profile that you might like too,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is a really good one.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got the Graceland cut from Southern
Oregon and grew it out this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just like, ah, it's like so
sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those Kushes work very well for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So look at the Medi Kush is more of like a
pre-96, pre-94, like a Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Baba Kushes, the Hindu Kushes.
[SPEAKER_05]: PK wasn't that much, but those heavier
Indicas is what works well for those
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes and those flavors, the high THC,
more higher CBD, lower CBN.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot of, yeah, a lot of
research.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some beautiful glazed cherry
crosses that we did this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the glazed cherry is like so dark and
deep red on the stalk and the leaf.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got some of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was glazed cherry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it was glazed cherry or
cross of it from Brandon and Amanda,
[SPEAKER_14]: the Rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: And dude, it was some of the most
interesting terpene profile I've had from
[SPEAKER_14]: a hash in a while.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like, it wasn't really like
anything else that I could say.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was so interesting and unique.
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved it a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it a white lotus glazed cherry?
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make any, does that remind you?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a glazed cherry dog.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why.
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: That could have been the dog from Jesse
and the glazed cherry from Green Source is
[SPEAKER_13]: my guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That it was from Bio Vortex.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to see the lot of the Ecuadorial
lineage kind of coming back into
[SPEAKER_16]: everyone's palette again.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Indica stuff was really dominating for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've been really partial to the
flavors and to the, I'd love gas,
[SPEAKER_16]: but I want more than just gas.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to see the expansion on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of nice to see.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of really nice stuff coming
out.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm growing a lot of really, really fun
stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just super terapy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, Johnny, you might like
the straw Nana to get that, get the 14
[SPEAKER_16]: percenter cut or something like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: That might be a really nice one for you to
run if you like those types of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just actually tried something that no
one's tried yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a the 24 week black, let me cross
with the girls go cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first one you saw me like for
the first time when I first went to church
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was sitting there smoking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of something really
nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing with all kinds of different
flavors, but I like the old school.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm kind of digging into some old vault
system, 88, 89, 91, some of the genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: from just, I guess, you know, that's what
I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what helped me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what I like those flavors and all
these newer flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was talking with Darren about it and
stuff like that is it seems like the gas
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like that old gas is just missing
from the strains with all these new
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the gas that kind of works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Penaline.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_13]: We drew the Jack.
[SPEAKER_13]: We drew the old Jack clone again this
year, Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Jack is high in terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darren's got that OG Kush from like 91 and
everybody wants it because it's high in
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm kind of looking at why are we
losing it, Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_16]: You just want this.
[SPEAKER_16]: You need the sour cut then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what any of you guys are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love all the different flavors and
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I never seem to be
complaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always have like five or six different
things that are bomber in front of me that
[SPEAKER_04]: are just all different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always have the strong Nana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely like always have some strong
Nana.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like picking the lead violin out of
the orchestra and saying, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the violin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you guys are mostly vaping on pipes
with a torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He muted himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, show us that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that back up there.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a Swiss perk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Swiss perk for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: With an email, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's unusual is I haven't turned it off
in three years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been on for two years except for I
took it to Jamaica for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever since Trump got elected.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as Trump got elected, he turned it
on, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was three years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I left my email on for about two years and
then one day I was in the shower and I
[SPEAKER_05]: came out and the whole bottom of the bowl
fell off and it burnt a hole in my counter
[SPEAKER_05]: and I unplugged it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to put it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it been plugged in for years now?
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost burnt down my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's because I have a Gabinator.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're built in Germany with discipline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not good on humor, but they're
great on engineering.
[SPEAKER_06]: They work with both European and American
electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I liked about the Dabinator,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always would take my D-nails to
Amsterdam and then I would forget that 40
[SPEAKER_04]: pound converter thing that they would give
me at the Krasnopolski Hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I carried that thing around Amsterdam with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how ridiculous this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I finally met the Dabinator dude,
he was just like, here, take one of these,
[SPEAKER_04]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I traveled all around with that thing and
all I had to do was plug a different plug
[SPEAKER_04]: into the back of the unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have to carry any giant thing and
I was like, okay, that is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also works with toy ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now companies make them in EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier ones was a challenge, but I know
D-nail, they all make EU units now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what would happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have it happen to you,
Etienne?
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens when you take that to a
different country and plug it in with the
[SPEAKER_04]: different plug with no inverter?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, generally what would happen to the
D-nails when I first got them,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know what years this was,
2000 something, it would pooch the whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: The electricity would go through and just
instantly pooch the whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a video where I'm in my little
apartment in the Krasnopolski and I've got
[SPEAKER_04]: the camera set up and I'm kind of moving
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm setting everything up and I realize it
happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go over and I'm like, oh no,
shit, shit, shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept it in the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, I gotta let people see my
reaction to this because it's so honestly
[SPEAKER_04]: bummed and pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I find, I remember I brought,
I remember this had happened to me already
[SPEAKER_04]: at least one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had brought an extra whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were, you'll be in the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Tony for some reason,
but you might've been in the video too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my Amsterdam videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might've plugged it into the
wall and blew it and then we didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: the D-nail in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that Spain?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that might've been Amsterdam the year
before, which is why I brought the second
[SPEAKER_04]: whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to go back and watch the video,
but it doesn't sound like the one you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that later that day after you had
done it?
[SPEAKER_04]: In Amsterdam, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, at the Krasnopolski.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, the Krasnopolski.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine worked fine, no problem in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to hear that, but I will know in
the future to take an extra whip just in
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm telling you, that was like a
super bummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I wanted to give a shout out to my
colleague, work colleague and friend,
[SPEAKER_04]: Shahed, who has just recently left Embark.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going back home to Ontario,
but she painted this photo of a trichome
[SPEAKER_04]: of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took this photo at my friend's house in
Port Alberni a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was over 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cultivar is, Burmese fucking
incredible is the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: She painted this little trichome photo for
me up above my shoulder here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to give her a shout out and
a thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have painted the one with your
face reflecting in the trichome,
Ed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the clear domes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a video where I put headband
hash on a sapphire insert by D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it on and it's the most incredible
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts bubbling like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: In every single bubble, you can see my
reflection.
[SPEAKER_04]: of me hitting the pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely like some crazy hash
inception type shit, but if you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't seen that, I could find it because
it's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I want to see that too.
[SPEAKER_10]: As a split moment, you were actually
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where it began.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking mental.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I didn't delete it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of feel like, oh no, there it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the man in the bubble.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Mark, I like your Garcia hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're working on getting the Gary Garcia
line.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, go ahead, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't have to say anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just showing you that this is the
video of me in the clear domes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble bubble toil and trouble.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, I just saw you right there on the
big one on the right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, I'm in every one if you look
closely.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every bubble, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's actually bubble man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I saw it again.
[SPEAKER_16]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: On your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should change it for this bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a family reunion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like all yourselves over how many
different... Dude, I wish I had a video of
[SPEAKER_04]: me making this video and then watching it
while editing it and realizing what had
[SPEAKER_04]: happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had a video of that because I was
also very Johnny B-esque.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like a child in a candy store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like you're getting high in all
these different dimensions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a macro photographer, videographer,
like I had never captured anything like
[SPEAKER_04]: that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have been working with refractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first refraction photo I ever
took.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look closely in the trichome,
there's a reflection of a cannabis leaf in
[SPEAKER_04]: the two main trichomes in the tall
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was my first version of it that I
ever got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never really went too much further
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got that video.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so really, this photo and that video
are really the only two refractions that I
[SPEAKER_04]: have where I'm like something's reflected
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus, I'm going to ask you something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have videos of teaching how to take
macro photography?
[SPEAKER_11]: You inspired me a lot and I just got a
macro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do another show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is one where I invited some
really great macro photographers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Eric Nugshots was on there and
Shale, I think, showed up and I had
[SPEAKER_04]: invited like all the guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I basically had invited all
the people I thought of as sort of had
[SPEAKER_04]: that had taken that macro cannabis
photography to the next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of stopped at a level.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys just took it to the next level,
doing a bunch of things that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: do, but never really got to, you know,
inspired enough to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, for instance, Shale creating his
own measurement scale with the trichome
[SPEAKER_04]: heads and now like, you know, one hundred
and eighteen microns like that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: do for like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was I hit him up the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, dude, where did you get that
template?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just made the template.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, damn right on, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because that shit's not easily
available to just go and find somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did one show.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those guys were on it and we talked
about macro photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to invite a variety of people
because depending on the lens that you
[SPEAKER_04]: have, you really need to take your advice
from someone who has that that lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I give you advice for an MPE
Canon lens and you're using reversals with
[SPEAKER_04]: billows and and extension tubes,
it's it's not quite the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what kind of macro camera
you have or lens, but it makes it inspires
[SPEAKER_04]: me to do another show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Invite those guys on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really wanted to photograph like resin
heads, too, but not only on the plan.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you talked about it a lot,
like actually photographing the melt,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, like the trichome heads like
separated.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I want to do it for and
photograph all the single source we make
[SPEAKER_11]: so we can like understand more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to make not only to make photography,
you know, but also to study the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you check Marcus check out,
check out Dooby Duck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an amazing macro photographer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known Dooby for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, his stuff is whole other level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever do stacked shots so that you
increase the depth of field?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what these guys do now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of them are stacking shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never stacked shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did stack photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the first time a guy showed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, this is how you do stack
photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had a rail system and this intense
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like moving the camera a tiny
little bit each time he took a shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you know, I think I've got
a better idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put my subject, the first stacked
image I ever did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 35 shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put the subject on my bubble box with a
felt bottom on a wooden table and I took
[SPEAKER_04]: shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I pushed the box over to the
right, like just a millimeter each time
[SPEAKER_04]: and took the shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: His chin was on the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: He couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd always been moving his camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never thought to move the subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just did that, took 35 shots,
snapped them together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was similar to this shot, this hash
shot, but it was it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked great, but it felt like to me,
I think I'm just an old school
[SPEAKER_04]: photographer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt kind of like cheating.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took away that challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is cheating.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is cheating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it took away the challenge of,
well, and reducing the depth of field.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you something from my
photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started taking my shots like this
one handheld.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't put my camera on a tripod.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn how to actually take that
photo and manipulate that small depth of
[SPEAKER_04]: field that I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always suggest to people who want to
learn macro photography, learn to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: first and then learn stacking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you learn stacking first,
when I talk to these stack guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can't believe that I'm taking my
shots handheld and getting the shots that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some cameras do it automatic.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, some do.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some do stack in the macro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a Lumix GH5 and it does amazing
stacking, just totally automatic on the 6K
[SPEAKER_12]: function.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, you know, Marcus,
I think you were the first person I ever
[SPEAKER_16]: met.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I think we connected as artists
and creatives, really.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Cannabis was kind of second for
us, who really made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_16]: To look at the plant from a closer point
of view and using your lenses and the
[SPEAKER_16]: tools that you're using as creatives to
make other projects and other things,
[SPEAKER_16]: to learn about the resin and really look
towards the plant as not only a subject
[SPEAKER_16]: matter, but a vehicle to learn about the
chemicals and the different things that
[SPEAKER_16]: you could, such as extraction and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that's really the first,
you know, some of the first photography
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus was from, of Trichome heads really
that I saw, other than scientific
[SPEAKER_16]: photography was really from you and the
work that you had kind of put out.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, helpful and so graciously,
because, you know, not everybody was
[SPEAKER_16]: sharing that kind of point of view at that
point in time.
[SPEAKER_16]: That, you know, that late 90s,
early 2000s kind of black space,
[SPEAKER_16]: as we will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I got a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps you're Giddy Ant, who took the
first clear dome shot on a screen that was
[SPEAKER_04]: like epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: On an overgrow days, I met him in London
and he brought me a framed photo of it and
[SPEAKER_04]: some beautiful bubble hash that he brought
me each day of the conference we did in
[SPEAKER_04]: Wembley Stadium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I puffed Wembley Stadium down hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also shout out to Monkey from,
really shout out to Monkey because from my
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective, I wanted to learn macro
photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Jason King, who was a friend of
mine at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Hey dude, like you've taken a
couple of macro shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, would you mind showing me how to
take some macro photographs?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, Oh yeah, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as soon as you show me how to design
and manufacture bubble bags in Nepal and
[SPEAKER_04]: sell them around the world on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was kind of like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like did I, was that a bad move on my
part?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of in the end just took it to
the fact that he was maybe being a bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: a dick and being insecure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when Monkey, when he was taking bug
shots on overgrow shots of his insects,
[SPEAKER_04]: his praying mantises that he would order
from the mail order and crack these eggs
[SPEAKER_04]: and grow these incredible praying mantises
out that would, he would take photographs
[SPEAKER_04]: of that were just shockingly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had the MPE lens and I hit him up
one day and I was like, Hey, I want to get
[SPEAKER_04]: into macro photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, okay, buy the 65 millimeter MPE
lens with the 24 EX MT dual flash from
[SPEAKER_04]: Canon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Set your ISO on a hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Set your, he starts telling me all these
settings as a base.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since he did that, I have always
shared every, I don't even feel like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: my, I always feel like I'm sharing his
information that it's just like pass it
[SPEAKER_04]: all on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though at this point it's like 15
years of my own knowledge that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: learned from taking macro photography.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see why it would be a bummer
for me to, to show people like there are
[SPEAKER_04]: people who will put time into this in a
way that I don't have the time anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people who will put time and
have access to certain things,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's exotic looking plants or
beautiful resins, you know, that's the
key.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing if you want to take macro
photography of resin, it's another like,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you have all the top quality access to,
you know, the highest grade material?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that becomes the super duper key.
[SPEAKER_04]: These lovebirds looking at each other
about their beautiful resins.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're staring into each other's eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like loving the fact that they got
all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like oozing and goozing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good on you guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing Marcus is, you know,
each photographer is going to bring a
[SPEAKER_16]: different point of view.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I was inspired by people like Tobin
Yellen and like even Bruce Weber of
[SPEAKER_16]: shooting like weird black and white
fashion photography.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, the, the ideas that you can,
you know, bring to the subject is,
[SPEAKER_16]: is really kind of really broad and,
and just like cultivation and extraction.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of creativity that you can
bring to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also got a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was taking photos in the eighties in
Holland with the electron scan microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I went to the first cannabis cup,
my first cannabis cup, not the first
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cup was in 1995.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I saw his little postcards.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had them at all these different sort of
smart shops and I would buy these
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful, perfect trichome shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would look so surreal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if many of you remember my first
advertisement in cannabis culture for
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble bags was a photo that I purchased
off of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I was so blown away that he was
willing to sell it for 800 gilders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, like it's my photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, it's yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you buy this photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put it on shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tattoo it on your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can like do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did is I took a full page ad out
in cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one of my customers at the time from
overgrow be like, Hey, let me do the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, let me, let me create some
cartoons on the trichome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, I want like, I want some
like heady people like climbing up the
[SPEAKER_04]: side of it with bags hanging off their
sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want them have pickaxes and be
chipping away at the head and little
[SPEAKER_04]: chunks of bubble flying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was my first ad.
[SPEAKER_04]: For bubble bags in cannabis culture
magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was you Dumas's photo in 1995 that
I first saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't take my first macro photograph
till 2008 to give you an idea how far
[SPEAKER_04]: ahead of his time he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's J O O P a Dumas D U M A S.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to kind of look him up
and see what he's into.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I really stoked about Chris from
Candid Kush.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been taking some really awesome shots
and staying with Caitlin and Ed from the
[SPEAKER_13]: Pot Snob cast.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're really doing a cool podcast and
they have built a beautiful tasting room
[SPEAKER_13]: in Mendocino, Northern Mendocino,
Caitlin and Ed and been doing some really,
[SPEAKER_13]: really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyone can should check out Candid Kush
in the work that he's doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just amazing to see like a far
away nug shot where it's beginning and
[SPEAKER_13]: then it goes in and then in farther and
farther all the way into like the heads,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, from a far away shot is like,
shit, that's such a killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Eric might've been the first one
to start doing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could be wrong, but I think he was in
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing it too and being like,
this is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like absolutely crushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I love these guys doing all this,
all this great stuff with macro
[SPEAKER_04]: photographs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alice has inspired me to put a list
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have, you know, want to send
me a private message with some names and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check out the photography and I'll
get a nice like 10 to 12 person group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never been done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys have never gathered in one spot
and who knows, maybe life's changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're not going to want to share
their information as readily as they once
[SPEAKER_04]: did, but maybe they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe it is a real special show,
particularly in the sense that it turns
[SPEAKER_04]: into a lot of other people being inspired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't get the idea of like,
if the whole thing is to pass the flame
[SPEAKER_04]: and like some little spark starts it over
here and then that gets passed over to
[SPEAKER_04]: here and it finally makes it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you really want to put that shit
out before you pass it on to the next
[SPEAKER_04]: person or hoard it and you know,
burn your whole interior down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think you're just supposed to have
it for a while and then share it.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's how it feels to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe in hoarding information.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe in the message.
[SPEAKER_16]: Free up the vibes.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd teach everybody how to use a rail
system, how to use focus, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: push and pull.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd also teach them lighting.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, Marcus, I think that would
be a really cool show to go through what
[SPEAKER_16]: it means to shoot.
[SPEAKER_16]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a specialty as much as it is growing
with organic soils and hash making.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a very specialized thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing about cannabis is that it has
definitely got me over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to learn an enormous amount just to
learn about it and to be able to share it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started, now I'm a photographer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm a macro photographer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm a videographer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm an editor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm like, it's just like one thing
after the other that you have to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm doing like podcasts and live
streaming and I got to learn that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things are like, you don't learn
them overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take a good amount of investment in
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Michael Pollan when he wrote
in the, I don't even know if he wrote this
[SPEAKER_04]: in the botany of desire, but he definitely
spoke about it maybe in a podcast in
[SPEAKER_04]: regards to how successful cannabis,
if you considered cannabis as a virus,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the same way like cordyceps can
infect an insect, control that insect's
[SPEAKER_04]: brain, move it to the top of a tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the spores fruit and blow out,
they get a greater distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is truly the cordyceps plant to
humans, to some of us anyway, because it
[SPEAKER_04]: gets in and then it literally is like,
I should grow lots of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should make lots of hash from the
cannabis that I grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should do shows on YouTube telling
people about the cannabis that I grow and
[SPEAKER_04]: the hash that I make and how great it is
and that they should do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I should do shows on photography on
cannabis and hash and how great it is to
[SPEAKER_04]: photograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really quite something how deep
it's rooted in some of our brains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like church.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what makes it a true master
plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why it's a master plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why plant medicine is so
important to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I want to put one up in the air to my
man, Martin out in Ireland, hemp in
[SPEAKER_13]: Ireland, amazing person out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just had some, put his aunt to rest.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to give him special
love.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big shout out to my man, Martin.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's taking dabs and taking hits with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's holding it down in the UK,
building an amazing family.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really into this glass and just making
things happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: So lots of love to you, Martin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put one in the air.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to Martin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll shout out to Martin too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great cat, very educated, really spreading
the word, doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to hear my deepest condolences,
mon frère, and wish you nothing but the
[SPEAKER_02]: best in love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I must know Martin as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_13]: You do.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's mentioned meeting you before.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's our Dragonfly ambassador out in
Europe, along with the Greengrass
[SPEAKER_13]: Connection, Edelgreen Swiss Farm,
the regenerative hemp farm out in
[SPEAKER_13]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thomas and all those guys out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big love to those guys as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also Thailand.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's a bunch of family out in
Thailand that watch us too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So big love to the Thai fam and everyone
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to D420K, who was in the chat
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might still be in the chat,
giving respect to everyone on the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put a little dab in the banger.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for this lime pop.
[SPEAKER_13]: This lime pop coming from Dave.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got that too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice, got the lime pop from Dave.
[SPEAKER_13]: 87.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big shout out to Gene.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big shout out to Gene from Mean Gene.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big shout out to Gene.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big shout out to Nick out in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nick Rizdin and The Lime Rising.
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazing people.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were growing one of their best crops
ever this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Had an 18, almost 20 foot tall plant and
saddest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: They went to go have their dog's leg
amputated and they came back and their
[SPEAKER_13]: whole crop was fucking ripped off.
[SPEAKER_13]: A good portion of all his weed was jacked
in his yard.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to say they're the hardest
working people out there because
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone's working so hard, but it's just
huge heart and soul in that family.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big love to the dad, everyone who was
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone who wants to help any of the people
in the fires.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone that wants to help Nick Rizdin and
The Lime Rising.
[SPEAKER_13]: Reach out to us later.
[SPEAKER_13]: Reach out to us on our Instagram and we
can pass the links.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we Marcus will send you as many
links as we know, like Brett from Dos
[SPEAKER_13]: Perros and maybe Sheldon and different
people that we know that have lost their
[SPEAKER_13]: farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could put those links in this YouTube
video for people to check out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like those fun memes and things that are
people using to build their life again
[SPEAKER_13]: because people have lost everything and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, a lot of people want to help.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a year where we've helped more
people than ever as a community.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just seems like not every so often it
comes up and all of a sudden we got to put
[SPEAKER_13]: it out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's not feel like we've helped people
too much.
[SPEAKER_13]: We might all as a group have to continue
helping people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's all put ourselves out there and
reach out to people in need.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a good group of people in need
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, fucking rippers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, what an absolute piece of shit,
low level thing to do to steal someone's
[SPEAKER_04]: hard work like that and their livelihood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the case of Nick Risen, he makes RSO or
cannabis oil for himself to fight Lyme's
[SPEAKER_13]: disease and he's truly keeping himself
alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: He would be a good person to have on this
show sometime because he's just so
[SPEAKER_13]: knowledgeable about strains and medicine
and what it takes to survive.
[SPEAKER_13]: He just recently had a crazy skin eating
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's making it through a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lyme's is really serious.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had Lyme's twice.
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't go away, but when you get bit
twice, it's pretty serious the second time
[SPEAKER_16]: around.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really intense.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the true warrior indeed also,
and you too probably for having that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just took a dab too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since you guys are saying some stuff,
I just want to shine a light on the
[SPEAKER_11]: subject too because I think we talked a
lot about the fires in California and in
[SPEAKER_11]: the West Coast and all over the United
States and Canada today.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are big, huge fires happening in
Brazil right now too.
[SPEAKER_11]: A bit different than here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's not natural fires.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all criminal fires in the highest
biodiversity places in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to send some love,
take this dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: A bunch of animals have died.
[SPEAKER_11]: A bunch of animals have burned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, what was burned right now in the
last month was over what was burned in the
[SPEAKER_11]: last 20 years total.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very crazy what happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to shine some love over
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: For everyone that is here and everyone
that is watching it too.
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone's taking a dab, smoking a joint,
just send some love.
[SPEAKER_11]: To all the spirits of the fires and the
winds, have mercy on all of us and just
[SPEAKER_11]: help us out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to shine a light on that too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to offer this dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think of David Attenborough's
quote about 94% of all mammalian life on
[SPEAKER_04]: earth, as humans and the livestock that
they cultivate, and the other 4% are all
[SPEAKER_04]: the zebras and lions and wild animals that
live out in the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: 4%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of how insane that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have fires of this size and that
many animals are dying, that could
[SPEAKER_04]: literally be half a percent of the 4%.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20% of all animal life on earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people really understand the
impact that something like that can have.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already messed things up to the
point where cows are taking up all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: space that wild animals used to take up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty messed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Brazil, that's what's going on,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They burn all the land so they can either
plant soy to feed cows or just to have
[SPEAKER_11]: cows over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally criminal action.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a direct result from a lack of state
that we have and from everyone political
[SPEAKER_11]: being careful with our environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just very, very, very sad.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a land that it's not usually burned.
[SPEAKER_11]: When it burns, it burns.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like it reputes because it's
like... Think of what's fueling that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's fueling that is human beings'
desires to consume flesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that for a thought?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an insatiable appetite.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never want to stop eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you can't make enough burgers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't feed enough of the world's grain
supply and enough of the clean water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give it to the cows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them the rain forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut everything else down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need my burgers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's all shine some love.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a picture of these rotting birch
logs behind me because we're putting these
[SPEAKER_13]: in the earth and growing weed on top of
them at some family in here in the
[SPEAKER_13]: Kootenays building a new farm and creating
a Hugo culture and putting the logs in the
[SPEAKER_13]: earth so they can last because all these
fires just burn up everything and it goes
[SPEAKER_13]: into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gone forever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't become microbes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't become long life forever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, again, want to encourage people to
put wood in the earth and sequester the
[SPEAKER_13]: carbon for as long as possible in the
earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy what's happening with fires.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the case of Southern Oregon and
Medford, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really feel for the Rogue Valley.
[SPEAKER_13]: The fire ripped through an urban area like
you were talking Wade White Paradise.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're talking from Ashland all the
way through to Medford, 10 miles of all
[SPEAKER_13]: towns, Phoenix and Tallent.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, massive 3,000 homes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thousands of homes were taken out down
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: In Tequilma in Southern Oregon,
they really mobilized as a community and
[SPEAKER_13]: really did a great job of protecting their
community from the fire from Happy Camp
[SPEAKER_13]: that was coming over.
[SPEAKER_13]: Incredible mobilizations have happened
from people.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty powerful.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Wendy from Sonibus obviously
couldn't make it today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I thought maybe she is going to come
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: She was going to talk about ash mitigation
on the flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we're going to try and send her a
link to get her on right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's people that had the fire within a
half a mile of their house just blazing,
[SPEAKER_13]: crowning, just dropping the shit on their
house and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: These are people with a good amount of
weed out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's anyone who has any information on
ash mitigation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Colin, have you ever had to deal with that
or do you know anyone since you're on
[SPEAKER_13]: right now?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some friends that are out there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone's using blowers.
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't want to wet your plants down
ever.
[SPEAKER_16]: You really want to refrain from doing
that.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just want to go out there and try to
keep it dry.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can put some hoops up, try to put
some hoops up, but don't put anything
[SPEAKER_16]: that's flammable because that could cause
other problems.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just got to be diligent and be on it
and be patient and really keep airflow as
[SPEAKER_16]: much as you can.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard two friends are putting fans
out there with jenny's to try to get
[SPEAKER_16]: airflow through the rows.
[SPEAKER_16]: To try to just help mitigate things and
just doing your best.
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of ash mitigation, it's just
blowers and fans.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're in a greenhouse too,
you can, if you have the ability to run
[SPEAKER_14]: power to it, use maybe a carbon filter and
a fan so that the air you're pushing in is
[SPEAKER_14]: clean and you have positive pressure in
the greenhouse so you're not drawing ash
[SPEAKER_14]: into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: For full terms, that's just tough.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the reasons why we grow in
greenhouses here in this area is not only
[SPEAKER_13]: from rain and all that, but if you're
concerned about chem trails or things,
[SPEAKER_13]: even metals from the sky.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also totally agree with growing outdoors
under the sun, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: reasons more and more to have a cover.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's even possible with outdoors
is to put a shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you don't want to shade your plants
when it's already smoky, but some type of
[SPEAKER_13]: cloth that can go over the top of your
plants that can stop ash from falling on
[SPEAKER_13]: it could be really useful.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could use tea stakes with bamboo on
the top and then put even just a
[SPEAKER_13]: horizontal cloth over your plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you'd only have to do that for a
week when the ash is really falling heavy.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the case of Oregon, they had a really
heavy duty rainstorm.
[SPEAKER_13]: They had that week of million acres burn
type thing and then got a heavy rainstorm
[SPEAKER_13]: on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe in the case of rain, potentially
that could actually wash it through rather
[SPEAKER_13]: than just turn it to mud.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't had too many conversations with
people that have reported anything
[SPEAKER_13]: negative from that rainstorm, but maybe if
you're trying to wash it with a spray or a
[SPEAKER_13]: hose, it's a lot different, but I guess
with nature, with the rains, I think in
[SPEAKER_13]: this case, it may have actually done okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really good to hear.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully Wendy can... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, because that carbon, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Dr. Mark could probably talk
about... Mark, you could probably chime in
[SPEAKER_16]: on what ash might or might not do a bit
more chemically.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to flavor the plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just going to give it a smoky flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when we had fires a couple of
years ago, we had some people on Hash
[SPEAKER_10]: Church who were discussing smoky flavor in
some of the extracts and water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who was that, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: This may have been about two or three
years ago on Hash Church and there were
[SPEAKER_10]: fires and we were talking about this very
issue and whether or not it comes through
[SPEAKER_10]: in extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, you could probably clean it out of
the distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably not... I think that's the
only way, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it come out any other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally ruined.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus, do you remember who we had on that
we were talking to this about?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been so many people that have been
on over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably are over a hundred different
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I seem to remember that what we were
talking about again is that, again,
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of folks who grow not necessarily
for oil markets or for extraction who grow
[SPEAKER_10]: for flour markets were saying,
hey, we can't sell our flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we extract it?
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a whole surge of, again,
people wanting to actually get into
[SPEAKER_10]: extraction just because they had to do
something to recoup the material that they
[SPEAKER_10]: lost because of the fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a bunch of smoky material on the
open market back then.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd probably take it that there will be
again this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting to see if some of
these folks who track it, who track
[SPEAKER_10]: wholesale index prices like cannabis
benchmarks, for one, I'm sure 18,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know about cannabis benchmarks,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: What they do is that's a website that
basically based on large transactions with
[SPEAKER_10]: large license dispensaries, they're able
to track the wholesale price of cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you see is in these kinds of cases,
again, supply-demand economics work where,
[SPEAKER_10]: again, if there's a constant supply,
and all of a sudden the supply tightens up
[SPEAKER_10]: or it doesn't smell as good and then
people are now extracting, you're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: see fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically, what they do is they follow
things like outdoor, differentiate outdoor
[SPEAKER_10]: from light debt and indoor and look at the
various wholesale prices.
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically, those numbers, right,
18, are always around anywhere between
[SPEAKER_10]: $1,200 to $1,300 a pound to as much as
$1,500 a pound and they move a little bit,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It fluctuates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go up slightly this year
because of fires and also local
[SPEAKER_02]: regionalizations and market stabilizing,
but also just because of, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: here in California we're still overtaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going there in PA?
[SPEAKER_10]: Our governor wants to do legalization and
legalization is on the ballot in New
[SPEAKER_10]: Jersey and it seems like there's going to
be just this domino effect between New
[SPEAKER_10]: Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York and
that legalization is just right around the
[SPEAKER_10]: corner.
[SPEAKER_10]: The product in the dispensary 18,
to tell you the truth, is pretty good and
[SPEAKER_10]: comparable in terms of pricing of what
you'd almost get on the black market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, certainly black market is still
alive and plentiful all throughout the
[SPEAKER_10]: East Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Black market in New York is still,
even when legalization happens,
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's going to go away
anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we use the term illicit market?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about traditional market?
[SPEAKER_16]: I like traditional market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think an interesting trend, and Etienne,
you could probably speak to this,
[SPEAKER_10]: is in California, my son's out in LA now
and he goes to dispensaries now and he's
[SPEAKER_10]: in the industry extracting, so he's seeing
a little bit of this dynamic in the
[SPEAKER_10]: marketplace, which is the popularity of
beverages.
[SPEAKER_10]: He says that people are going to
dispensaries and buying beverages by the
[SPEAKER_10]: cases, like these fruity, limey,
whatever beverages.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's all kinds of new products
that are out there in the market,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I guess that being a new category,
and again, not something necessarily you
[SPEAKER_10]: can make at home unless you're making your
own soda or taking an extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be interesting to see if you can
take an extract that you could buy at a
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensary and use one of those home soda
makers and try to make a carbonated
[SPEAKER_10]: beverage with your own cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything we made was created by
patients for patients originally,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yes, there is an uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: More if there's an uptake in edibles
period in the COVID era.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the evil eye problem with the
cartridges, so cartridges have dips.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're starting to come back,
but flowers and definitely edibles and
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates too.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have a lot of time to sit around
apparently, so we've seen an uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely in the quality as well of the
rosin we've had access to and natural
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions as well as the extractive
products are definitely getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of the flower is still not to
where I want it to be for the price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's about two price points
higher than it should be compared to when
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually dealing internally of
selection, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the market corrected itself
better in Nevada and California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still too productiony for my
expectation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some quality craft growers,
but this is the problem with the fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: The craft growers are the ones that are
being hit very hard whereas opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the indoor production is going on
without any type of problem, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic outdoors, fuck man, it pisses me
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's challenging and painful to see the
loss because one of my main suppliers,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, Foxworthy Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Martin and them lost access or had
problems prior.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to save some and get some
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the fires were encroaching,
but have to see how it's harvested and
[SPEAKER_02]: dried to see exactly the quality of what
it'll be.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are dealing with this
reality right now and it's frustrating and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's sad to see on top of that fire season
ain't over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in the midst of it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blessings to everybody and to all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay safe, stay sound, stay wet as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it damp out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were talking about markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say black markets matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one thing that's for sure is that
there's a lot more processing capability
[SPEAKER_10]: today than just simply two or three years
ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: That processing capability, see the dog
agrees with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That processing capability means that
there's now people who are doing toll
[SPEAKER_10]: processing in the cannabis so you can grow
cannabis legally.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can bring it to a whole processor and
they can make oil for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing is that we were talking a
little bit about this before.
[SPEAKER_10]: That bill that's in Congress right now,
which is the 8178, I think, which is the
[SPEAKER_10]: thing that's going to basically regulate
CBD as a dietary supplement.
[SPEAKER_10]: This just totally needs to happen because
right now the painful thing that Epidiolex
[SPEAKER_10]: has done is it puts CBD on a list of being
an active ingredient of an FDA approved
[SPEAKER_10]: drug and you can't put active ingredients
in food or cosmetics or dog food.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to enable that is this thing
that, I pulled up the thing just on my
[SPEAKER_10]: computer for a second now, was the act
that's currently, I think it's called
[SPEAKER_10]: 8178.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's either Blumauer or the other guy from
Oregon who's basically put this thing
[SPEAKER_10]: forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposedly, even Mitch McConnell wants
this to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, that's like the gate,
unfortunately, in our government of
[SPEAKER_10]: whether or not things are actually going
to get voted on is the head guy in the
[SPEAKER_10]: Senate has to be okay with it to bring it
to the floor for a vote.
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposedly, they have bipartisan support
of this, but what this is going to do is
[SPEAKER_10]: this is going to carve CBD out of the
process that you were talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: before, the IND process, which is an
investigational new drug thing with the
[SPEAKER_10]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to carve it out and put it into
the dietary supplement thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like the Qnol or the vitamin C or
the other things that you could extract
[SPEAKER_10]: from plants, put it into a capsule.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or how about that shit Prevagen?
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Something from a jellyfish, they extract
jellyfish, put it into a capsule,
[SPEAKER_10]: give it to senior citizens, and now it all
of a sudden improves their memory.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Prevagen.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the category that CBD and DT and
tobacco actually all belong in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not tobacco, but- What do you think
of that interim rule the DEA did recently
[SPEAKER_04]: on the hemp farm bill?
[SPEAKER_04]: The way it opens up for GW, because
there's a thing in there that says anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: with FDA approved products will no longer
have to have permits or licensing for
[SPEAKER_04]: import or export.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, listen, these guys are getting
ready to clear the board.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the interim final ruling is,
is an attempt by the DEA to harmonize the
[SPEAKER_10]: Controlled Dangerous Substance Act with
the American Agriculture Improvement Act,
[SPEAKER_10]: aka the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_10]: The farm bill basically says, if it's
below 0.3 THC in the plant, it's legal,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's hemp, high five, go grow your hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: They forgot that as soon as you buck those
hemp plants and you take not the entire
[SPEAKER_10]: plant at 0.3, now you take the more potent
parts of the plant, as soon as you trim
[SPEAKER_10]: it, to extract it, to distill it,
to isolate it- Oh, way over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, except the isolate, if you're
talking about CBD isolation portion,
[SPEAKER_10]: but the dirty secret is, again,
we talked about this on Hash Church a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_10]: At 0.3% in a typical yield of these high
yielding varieties like lifter and cherry
[SPEAKER_10]: wine and whatnot box and all those,
on a typical yield of an acre of hemp,
[SPEAKER_10]: if you grow like a drug variety,
in a drug variety kind of way,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's almost like five pounds of THC per
acre.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of THC, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they never, geez, the intellectual
furnaces weren't burning hard enough to
[SPEAKER_10]: realize that, well, even if we regulate
this stuff and put this stuff as 0.3 in
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant, that every step along the way,
until you're in the diluted tincture,
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously the diluted tincture,
is back down to 0.3 or whatever it was in
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant, but everything along the way,
which is all work in progress,
[SPEAKER_10]: hemp extract, is all basically illegal,
just based on the amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole Delta- Not only that,
Mark, but the truth of it is, if you have
[SPEAKER_06]: a high CBD variety that's over 10%,
the odds are it's hot if you let it
[SPEAKER_06]: mature, because CBD, synthases produce
about a 25 to one ratio of THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam, I was in a field yesterday,
just right down the road here in Maryland,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's growing a high CBG variety of
something called Lifter, and there is no
[SPEAKER_10]: THC in that variety at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zero, none.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can second that, Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got about one or 2% in dry waste,
it's got about one or 2% CBD, but it's got
[SPEAKER_10]: like about 18% CBGA.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's completely got all of its
synthases shut down, at least after what
[SPEAKER_10]: the got, the geraniol, allotilvic,
transferal, phosphatase, whatever,
[SPEAKER_10]: the thing that puts together CBGA,
but all the other synthases that either
[SPEAKER_10]: make CBCA or THC, or CBGA were all
basically shut down in that variety.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really interested to see what
that's like.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a small nugget downstairs,
I'm trying to make something, I wanna
[SPEAKER_10]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: People have asked me, they're like,
what's that like when you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I'll try to see what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna extract it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We developed high CBG varieties more than
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of level?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, 15%, that's pretty high,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty high, I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And ours also had little to no THC at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't smoke CBG for recreational
purposes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it make you feel high or relaxed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I don't like CBD, I don't like
CBG, I don't like CBC, none of them get me
[SPEAKER_06]: high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't like them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke to get high, not to get healthy
because I'm already healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just crushed COVID out in 24
hours?
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's patented it probably.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mark, I've been dry sifting some CBG and
it's really a nice resin to work with.
[SPEAKER_16]: It produces, it's unlike CBD where it's
very viscous and very low yielding and
[SPEAKER_16]: typically a lot darker in amber and by
nature, it's for some reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's a full melt dab of that like?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what is that?
[SPEAKER_16]: To me, the feeling I get from it when I'm
at kind of base level, which I still have
[SPEAKER_16]: Delta 9 in my system, I feel kind of
relaxed if I'm really in tune with myself.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think individuals that are more
sensitive to cannabinoids and minor
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabinoids that don't have as much Delta
9 in their system, feel a bit more sedated
[SPEAKER_16]: from it.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I commonly hear.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's, you know, it is still very
individual and that's, it's still
[SPEAKER_16]: anecdotal at best right now, how
everyone's kind of tapping into it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there is, I see a lot of promise.
[SPEAKER_16]: From the extraction side, I think it's
really desirable.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'm really curious to see what
that can do us in Fresh Rosen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we developed it 15 years ago for
medicinal use, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we tried it for recreational use and
like THC, pure THCV varieties or CBG
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties or CBD or CBC, they don't really
have true recreational value.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some people will say CBD calms you
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but that's not getting you ripping
hot.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what about together, Sam,
like what about all of these major and
[SPEAKER_16]: minor cannabinoids together at various
levels?
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you agree that, you know,
removing one of them would change that
[SPEAKER_16]: experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not tried them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, everybody's tried equal
mixtures of CBD and THC because all of the
[SPEAKER_06]: important sifted hash traditionally was a
mixture of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some arguments out that the
cannabinoid synthase, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_16]: entourage effect, you know, this general
subject that we kind of touch on,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, to remove one percentage of
let's say CBC or CBG from a, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: cultivar profile, which completely
reshaped the experience of that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, same thing on the on the terpene
synthase.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's I don't know if anyone has any
thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's, it's something that I've been
kind of thinking about lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: I traditionally bred high THC varieties
for recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when I was interested in medicinal
varieties, we created the world's first
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD only variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same thing with CBC, CBG, THCV.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did all those.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were not for recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were for medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a full cannabinoid spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mix all my water concentrates
together and sieves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put all my BHOs, et cetera,
together and mix them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for me, that's word for me is a
full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I try one thing, I get a little bit of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try something else, get a little bit of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for over a decade, personally,
I've just mixed it all together into,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and keep adding to it like an
everlasting gobstopper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sounds like full spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's works for me because I asked
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, because some people can
find a certain flower specifically works
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have because of my Gulf War syndrome,
I have various different symptoms from
[SPEAKER_02]: nerve damage to nausea to migraines to,
you know, a different situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each one sort of matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, combining the ensemble
effect of them all allows me to be
[SPEAKER_02]: productive and allows me to be a part of
society.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you smoke in the 60s and the 70s
before there were the minor cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hanging out in my mom's ovaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're having a great time,
you know, me and the other eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all like, sup, sup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Sam, you're old.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I didn't get turned on till I was,
you know, yeah, 18, 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I didn't really get turned on to
real concentrates until I was out here in
[SPEAKER_02]: California in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, your experience, you were you
were well into it way before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this is what I found over time
for me during the access, because early on
[SPEAKER_02]: in an oakster dam, I was able to get a lot
of quality water hash to I had the
[SPEAKER_02]: original machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working at the Galaxy Gallery back in
the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was making my own water hash and
people were contracting with me to make
[SPEAKER_02]: their water hash for them because they'd
never seen a machine that could make
[SPEAKER_02]: quality hash like this that bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that blew our minds, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just would initially just take
scrapings off of the coffee filters and
[SPEAKER_02]: then mix them together in a coffee
grinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what started it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're way ahead of us by decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't know what cannabinoids you were
smoking because until when was it 1990 or
[SPEAKER_06]: no, wait till 2000, there was not
analytical labs available in California.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Sam, when do you think the first
analytic, you know, analytics really were
[SPEAKER_16]: for cannabinoids, you know, because it
you're touching on this idea?
[SPEAKER_06]: People like Dr. Osole have been doing this
for decades and decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: We began our work in the very early 1990s,
where we got an analytical lab,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was we checked with Dr. Brandeisen
with the same sample to Brian,
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Brandeisen and Dr. Osole and our lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got identical results.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we knew we were doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And who was running that lab, Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like was Dave Pate, the main chemist
there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the chemist that was hired to do
all this work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_16]: So at that time, you guys are really kind
of for, you know, the this is really great
[SPEAKER_16]: because it's, you know, the stuff I look
at every day, you know, is probably on the
[SPEAKER_16]: shoulders of the work that you and your
team was doing, you know, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_16]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, what we, you know,
what we're looking at from in terms of the
[SPEAKER_16]: microbial test is really kind of,
I would still say, kind of very limiting
[SPEAKER_16]: in terms of what we're able to see and
test for.
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you kind of agree?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, our focus was not that, to be
honest, we were growing organically and we
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't worry about it because we were not
selling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that said, I mean, the truth of it was
nobody had minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody knew what they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're writing how happened to have
some in it, you didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, that's why.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what varieties do you think were what
regions of the of, you know, the world in
[SPEAKER_16]: terms of of the, you know, where things
kind of stemmed from post ice age?
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think a lot of these these miners
were really kind of coming from or were
[SPEAKER_16]: they really selectively bred?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they were all over when the way we
bred high single cannabinoid varieties of
[SPEAKER_06]: a minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was, for example, THCB.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used California orange because it had
small amounts in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used a Thai variety that had small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used an Afghan variety that small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I used a South African variety that
small amounts of THCB.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we sell those for generations and
then combine them all at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had a variety that was well over 10
percent THC with little to no THC.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and we did the same thing for all
the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took about four or five years for each one
of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were doing a lot of them at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you guys went through like a whole
generation.
[SPEAKER_16]: You went through several generations like
you went.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we went through five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything was was analytically
analyzed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that we were able to use the next
generation's best of for that targeted
[SPEAKER_06]: compound.
[SPEAKER_16]: So were you guys able to really track what
what acid, you know, what acid forms were
[SPEAKER_16]: really happening at what times through the
process?
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you guys get that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we could.
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't so interested in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, we had HPLC and we had GCFD for
the terping.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think the thing I'm trying to
understand now is is how we can track that
[SPEAKER_16]: through certain varieties to phenohunt
and, you know, to to maximize the most out
[SPEAKER_16]: of a, you know, any said variety to get
not only the best phenotype, but the best
[SPEAKER_16]: chemo type.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my my suggestion is grow organically
in the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to greenhouse when I lived in
Holland, I didn't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and they will express the cannabinoid
terping maximum that that variety can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, it's not hard to grow
excellent weed as long as you don't make
[SPEAKER_06]: stupid mistakes.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we all do.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that means we shouldn't deforest
them.
[SPEAKER_16]: We should take all that and do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Josh was saying, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow organically with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, I thought you were perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: He who has passed and did everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were the perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm so perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not quite perfect.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I appreciate the information,
Sam, and the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, you know, it's it's something,
you know, I'm always trying to pick up on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Sam, when were you first asked about
early lab?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say Dr. Osole, Brenneisen and Dr.
Moshul of an associate were three of the
[SPEAKER_06]: very, very best.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's who we emulated and we
considered our leaders.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we got the same results from the
same samples as they did, we knew we were
[SPEAKER_06]: doing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when were you first educated on beaver
terpenes there, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I went to Canada and I
can't help but think Horatio would be
[SPEAKER_04]: smiling, knowing we're still talking about
beaver terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's funny is that they're actually used
in the food and fragrance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raspberry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Raspberry flavoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanilla, raspberry, a bunch of beaver
terps.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: The beavers sitting there in Canada giving
us the raspberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, earlier we were talking about
beaver terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go back up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a million things going on.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kelly, you're like a beacon of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same about you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying, you know, we're talking
about the mitigation of ash and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: small farmers are getting hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, ATN, you were just saying,
you know, sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting hit harder than ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really need those small farmers to
be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the single most important
things that we could do on the planet
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth is to help small organic farmers be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the ways that I just wanted to
say to everybody out there who's
[SPEAKER_01]: listening, who has a small farm,
your success is really important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to many of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just was thinking, you know,
maybe being done earlier, try to put
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the ground that's going to
have all of your crops done, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good portion of it done early,
whether that's these beautiful auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers that are coming on, you know,
some really beautiful trichomes that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're done in early August or to do
light depth, small light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least part of your crop is going to
be finished before the fire season comes
[SPEAKER_01]: on, because that's just really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I don't like about auto
varieties is you can't grab the best clone
[SPEAKER_06]: so easy and use it for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to be breeding it for seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really depends.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted to mention there's a
company up there in Canada called Sabra,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they have developed a way to keep
mother plants of auto varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody who needs their services can
check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because we've come into the legal
market, you know, keeping clones for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sun ground people is not important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding is absolutely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having seeds, direct sowing into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it earlier, Sam, you know,
direct sowing deep soil beds or how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to reach the ultimate potential of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really encouraging these small
farmers to have their own breeding stock
[SPEAKER_01]: that's biologically intelligent to their
soils, to their areas, to their zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more that we breed for an early
finishing, we can really beat out those
[SPEAKER_01]: fires and these farmers can have great
success.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the heart rock lion claws,
so dank and filled with flavor and the
[SPEAKER_13]: buds are super solid and I mean,
in Daniel's case at heart rock,
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think he did 140 crosses this
year and he's planning on doing 300
[SPEAKER_13]: crosses next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for good breeding, you really do need
clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're part of the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's a reason to keep clones.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know if you have to in the
case of like, you know, auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, but there's a there's intention
to everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if your intention is to do some certain
thing with a clone, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that we could really
have that discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a really interesting
topic, Sam, because when you take clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really starting to mitigate the
immune response of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to take that plant inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to put it into a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer in a microbial rich
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think small farmers, I think that
it's really great for them to continually
[SPEAKER_01]: choose their varietals by using chemo
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these farmers now have field
tests that they're able to look at their
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really able to track what it
is that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're able to do it intelligently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an interesting, if we're going
to be just small farmers and we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: just talking about science and we're not
just looking at it in a scientific way,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're going to get out a good tricone
rich crop that can be used out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding seeds is a wonderful opportunity
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to bring up the other
side of that, you know, and not taking
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I, for example, I maintain my mother's
in the ground, 15 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I wish I could do that, Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I have, we have some big mothers
and we got a whole room of them,
[SPEAKER_16]: but even at a facility, that's a big
mother.
[SPEAKER_16]: We, we changed our mothers out more often
than that.
[SPEAKER_16]: To try to keep them more vigorous and try
to keep the, you know, as much vigor and,
[SPEAKER_16]: and is least pathogen, you know,
filled as we can, you know, cause there's
[SPEAKER_16]: a lot of things that go along.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have pest and pathogen problems
because I use so many bio controls as
[SPEAKER_06]: preventative to be honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Sam, do you, I mean, I, Kelly,
I think, you know, the, it's an
[SPEAKER_16]: interesting topic because I think about a
lot of these things and you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: there's, when you're talking about saving
seed and saving varieties, Sam,
[SPEAKER_16]: when you agree, it's good to save,
save the seeds and save, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: save those, those potential new phenotypes
and chemotypes that you could get from.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, starting offspring from bringing
things together that, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: you, you may have hand selected,
even though it might not be 2000 or 5,000
[SPEAKER_16]: of each to, to keep the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_16]: As we say, I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I, I've kept clones for 22 years,
24 years actually.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I also still started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but I've also started new seeds and I
also recognize the value, especially now
[SPEAKER_16]: when I'm, now that I'm growing at scale
for commercial reasons, we're starting
[SPEAKER_16]: like all types of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm seeing some really interesting
things that I would have never thought as
[SPEAKER_16]: a younger self to even, you know,
to even try or attempt to do, cause I just
[SPEAKER_16]: have these clones that I just know so
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I think the closest,
uh, agricultural crop similarity wise is
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you want a new strawberry variety,
you, you cross a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties that have wild or whatever that
have the traits you're after.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they grow out 20,000 seeds and they
select the 10 or 20 that are the most
[SPEAKER_06]: favorable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they reproduce runners from those
mother clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, they eventually have new,
millions of runners to use as a production
[SPEAKER_06]: crop and that's the way campus is.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think to Kelly's point, I think
that's, you know, I think it's a good
[SPEAKER_16]: thing to, I don't know, personally,
I think it's a good thing to be exploring
[SPEAKER_16]: and, uh, understanding, you know,
what different varieties could do,
[SPEAKER_16]: do together.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause you know, it's expensive in terms of
the creative aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's natural evolution.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you, you know, without that,
the, you know, the clone never changes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously you're going to be doing seed
breeding, but it's fun to keep like a sour
[SPEAKER_13]: diesel forever, for example, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like who doesn't want to grow a whole
entire greenhouse of sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the recessive traits always come up
when you breed with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really difficult to recreate.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and that's the other thing for me that
I'm interested in is trying to work with
[SPEAKER_16]: the dominant traits that on some of these
really elite things that I have.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, it's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_16]: To try to see what other offspring can,
you know, kind of kind of do.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, uh, Marcus and I were,
we're talking to a friend, uh,
[SPEAKER_16]: to a friend of his the other day.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a little while ago on a,
on a chat and he was talking about using
[SPEAKER_16]: the sky jar from Eugene to, to breed with
his other crop because it was so
[SPEAKER_16]: noninvasive.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it really brought the dominant traits
out in the, in the, the parent stock that
[SPEAKER_16]: he was using.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that, you know, it's, I think there's a
lot of value to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep clones for, for breeding and for
production, but I every year grow the
[SPEAKER_06]: majority of the plants from seed because
that's where the new exciting shit is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's a lot like an apple
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you can have this beautiful,
gorgeous apple tree and it's the best
[SPEAKER_01]: apples ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can take the seeds off of that
apple tree and you're never going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to recreate that same apple tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do, you know, breed with that
clone or whatever, it's never going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is some beauty in the sour diesel
being held forever or that Jack hair that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so stoked that people are holding onto
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They grabbed them, they grabbed them
because you can grab a mother onto 1
[SPEAKER_06]: billion different graphs and you get a
branch of that unique apple.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's easy ways to maintain apples
forever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Resin ranch, resin ranch.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up in the house?
[SPEAKER_15]: Stopping by Alice was like, Hey,
you want to say hi?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you guys all doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the shirt.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're, uh, we're surviving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting pretty impacted by the fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been by the August, the August
complex fire in your area.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fire is, uh, been smoking out the farm.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, down here in Sebastopol, we've pretty
much been flanked by fires all summer.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's been totally.
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like it's starting to take a toll
on my health at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wanted to come on and that's
what I wanted to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if this was, uh,
the right time to do that, but just about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how we can, you know,
mitigate some of the toxic intake of the
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke and the ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been really focused on our
plants because our plants is our income.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plants is our future, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our health and wellbeing is also our
future and how we're going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make our next decisions and how
we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to talk about a few
things that people could be allying with
[SPEAKER_01]: down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's, let's talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a good time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we like cool?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted, if you wanted to come in
and talk about some updates that were
[SPEAKER_01]: really important that people need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the region and area first or.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, updates.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of hard to stay up with us.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just tell anybody get on the Cal Fire
website because it's, I mean, it's
[SPEAKER_15]: changing some days.
[SPEAKER_15]: It changes hourly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, the August complex fire is definitely
taking a major toll on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: industry in Humboldt and this year,
I think more than any previous year.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, definitely more farms actually
burning.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just being impacted by ash and smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I don't want to get into the stories
I'm hearing about how Cal Fire is treating
[SPEAKER_15]: the situation up there on some properties.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, it's just messed up.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we, I think it's pretty eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of the people in the room,
I think would agree with me that as human
[SPEAKER_15]: beings, we need to open our eyes up to
what's going on and makes serious changes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And be aware.
[SPEAKER_15]: As human beings, we can't, we can't live
like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's kind of the thing I was
thinking about the other day.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember a discovery channel show on the
end of the world and them talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: climate change and massive fires in the
West that would burn uncontrolled and air
[SPEAKER_15]: quality.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I remember thinking, Oh man,
that sounds horrible, but that probably
[SPEAKER_15]: won't happen in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_15]: And here we are living it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So like the last two weeks, I pretty much
have had a low grade headache the whole
[SPEAKER_15]: time, really low on energy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and when we looked into that,
they call it a carbon headache,
[SPEAKER_15]: apparently from inhaling so much smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: And like you said, yeah, we all worry
about our plants because it's our income.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I definitely have put myself in some
situations this year that probably put my
[SPEAKER_15]: health in order to salvage the cannabis,
which I'm not sure how I feel about that
[SPEAKER_15]: personally at this point, which is,
you know, we always, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: we hold this plant so high and we do so
much for it, but, and when it's your
[SPEAKER_15]: income, it is hard to make that call that
I need to walk away.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you were faced with that this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we've been faced with it more than
once.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I have, uh, you know,
a farm I consult on that is up on spy
[SPEAKER_15]: rock, which is now starting to be
evacuated.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?
[SPEAKER_15]: Then an evacuation warning for a while.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_15]: Spyrox it's going to actually get to that
point, but we've said that a few times and
[SPEAKER_15]: it's crossed the field.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't think that was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that, that, that carbon headache
that you're feeling is just massive
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalation of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is there's a restriction
of the capillaries in the body because the
[SPEAKER_01]: body starts to react to such a massive
change in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so much a part of our environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the earth resonates at a like a 7.82
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't quote me on the same numbers,
but you know, that humans resonance and
[SPEAKER_01]: our bodies resonate on the same exact,
you know, uh, frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there's like a whole lot of smoke
and fire in the air, not only is there a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of smoke and fire in the air,
but the actual resonance of the vibration
[SPEAKER_01]: of the area in this zone that you're in
actually changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's incredibly detrimental to us on
lots of different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only are we getting smoke
inhalation, but the resonance is changing
[SPEAKER_01]: and we need to be dealing with mental
health issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people are like,
Whoa, another day of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is it that we're in COVID and
that people are having restrictions all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place, but we're dealing with the
lack of sunshine, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ash and smoke and also the resonance
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to take care of your internal
health, you know, allying with OSHA right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, OSHA root is so, so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it in Tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it in, um, any, and it's found
in the Hills of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it bear grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, and, and go, oh yeah,
OSHA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we can really
find in a lot of zones and regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also any kind of immune stimulants,
uh, Echinacea right now is being dug up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say, you know, more than ever,
this is a time to really look at our
[SPEAKER_01]: farms, look at our little gardens and what
haven't we planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have burdock root?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good for cleaning the blood right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, also activated charcoal, taking a lot
of activated charcoal because when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing in these toxins, you know,
it's actually being lodged into different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas of your body and activated charcoal
can help wash it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, and bentonite clay is another
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zeolite clay, even more activated,
more charged, easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also, you know, your indigenous
microorganisms, however you all are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, making indigenous microorganisms
for your plants, make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking a little bit of your EM,
a little bit of your lactic acid bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, your sauerkraut water,
your kimchi, all of those things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to boost our microbiome is
incredibly important right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanted to say last is the most
important is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be drinking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be drinking more water than
you even think that your body can be
[SPEAKER_01]: handling right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when your belly is full of water,
you have to be drinking more water because
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the plants and in the air,
all of the ash is taking all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity particles out of the air and it's
causing an incredible dehydration in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air and in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have dehydration, all that
does is exacerbate all of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: maladies that we might be holding on to,
which is absolutely the same as our mental
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for already on the edge of not feeling
so well, we get dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're in a hole of, of depression
or not feeling well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really important drinking water and,
and, and opening up our hearts right now
[SPEAKER_01]: to compassion for those people that are
really needing help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as human beings, we are here on
this planet to be a collective
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now more than ever, we need to
recognize that a part of our planet is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, is really hurting right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever we can, those people who
aren't on the west coast, send good vibes
[SPEAKER_01]: to the west coast, send good vibes to our
brothers and sisters that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prayer matters.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so people on the west coast feel
like they're getting burned.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, I think you may be
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Todd, what?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's, uh, that's kind of the other
thing is the stress level that I know I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: operating at, and I can imagine that
everybody else in my position is operating
[SPEAKER_15]: at this year on top of it just being 2020
and all the other crap going on is it's
[SPEAKER_15]: pretty insane that I've actually gotten
comfortable operating at this stress
[SPEAKER_15]: level.
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of scares me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, it's just this year more than
others has me rethinking things.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when I first hopped in, Alice said,
you guys were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: starting earlier, different times,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just talking about that the other
week that totally has me rethinking how I
[SPEAKER_15]: want to run the gardens and do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I don't, I don't think I'm going
to even attempt a second depth next year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Diversify and really make use of your
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your product.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hard for me to pull off a second depth in
my spot, just as it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then like, you know, we flipped the
hoops, the fire happened the next day.
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't see the sun for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: I plant through the roof, you know,
node spacing is like a foot.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, you know, it's in the full terms do
all right because they got to set up
[SPEAKER_15]: earlier in the year before fire season.
[SPEAKER_15]: They seem to handle it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't seem to get smoke damage as
easy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they've already kind of coal it
up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, back to more full terms,
more seed starts, less steps.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are, you know, we're outlying with
a plant that's an adaptogen and we,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as cannabis farmers,
a lot of us who have been in this for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time have been really adaptogenic to
laws, to regulations, to still trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get our crop out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really encourage us as a community,
even though we're feeling really beaten
[SPEAKER_01]: down, we are resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're an incredibly resilient group of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never met a more resilient group of
people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take that resilience and become
adaptogens and switch up what we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can still get out the good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we need to just have one depth
that's even bigger, that's earlier or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, even longer varietals that go
even way further, you know, let's also
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about finishing
earlier, but what about those you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really long flowering sativas,
you know, thinly varietals that go and go
[SPEAKER_01]: and go, that aren't really done until the
beginning of December.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people in California can be
doing, you know, those varietals well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're well out of,
you know, the fire season.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I wanted to say is that as
well as the cannabis is an adaptogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing to ally with is our
medicinal mushrooms are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are doing micro sweet
medicinal mushrooms, so incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: important right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also so many people are doing cubensis
and really doing a lot of micro dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ann Arbor, Michigan, woo, woo,
just legalized or just decriminalized
[SPEAKER_01]: cubensis or any kind of psychedelic plant
medicine, which is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who are experiencing
depression, you know, a lot of really
[SPEAKER_01]: super low dosing psychedelic mushroom has
been really helpful for people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, also agaricon and cordyceps are
both very supportive to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So to use agaricon and cordyceps in teas
and ingest that is going to be supportive
[SPEAKER_13]: to your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turkey tail as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the other thing that I was
saying just really quickly is that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with Wade yesterday with Trix and
Potent Ponix on his awesome live broadcast
[SPEAKER_01]: that he did all day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, is that cannabis is just such an
incredible and incredibly intelligent
[SPEAKER_01]: being.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working hand in hand with this
plant for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its intelligence is ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our intelligence is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really believe that those of us who
bred 2020 seeds, it's just incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: important for us to get out that that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year is so potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so transformative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in this this state of of new
discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis plant is also feeling
that vibration of us being in the gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those plants that are the seeds
that are being bred, then being popped
[SPEAKER_01]: next year will have all of the
intelligence will have maybe even all all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the answers to the future remedies that
we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so important to just keep popping
those seeds, especially the ones that we
[SPEAKER_01]: made this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll end it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just with you saying about the seeds
created this year, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the last two seasons,
it kind of got away from kind of what Joey
[SPEAKER_15]: taught me with this big seed start start
early.
[SPEAKER_15]: Overall, they're generally going to be
healthier, more bug resistant and got into
[SPEAKER_15]: a scene that really we really had to make
it kind of make money, as you guys know.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to pay our bills and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we went more to the depth thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this year I talked my partner into,
hey, let's let's clear a little area and
[SPEAKER_15]: do some big full terms again.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got to say, just again, with all the
crap that goes on, I'm fully sold on big
[SPEAKER_15]: seed starts again and starting from seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And like you say, they have all that
knowledge now of this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what what's that going to be
advantageous for us in the future if,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, the cannabis starts figuring out
on its own.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I need to finish earlier because it's
going to be smoky as hell.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's got to be genetic coding on
the evolution that says that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: plant has lived through fire and its
evolution.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there's probably important terpenes
that come out in it, protecting itself
[SPEAKER_13]: from ash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's actually, so the one thing
I do know is that after a forest fire,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, what sort of comes out of the ash from
the forest, the bread of the forest is
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a compound that's that fits into a
class of compounds called butinolides.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this particular butinolide is actually
one that enhances seed germination.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it totally makes sense from a natural
perspective point of view.
[SPEAKER_10]: So after a forest fire happens,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole rebirth in the forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, when it turns out that the compounds
that are in the soot are actually the
[SPEAKER_10]: compounds that actually encourage seed
germination, it kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Mother Nature using her own chemistry
set to sort of enhance, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the replacement of the of the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get the fireweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like fireweed is the pink plant that
grows after forest fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the first plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And morels comes up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it should be a huge year for morels
next spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you're bringing that up,
which is really odd is I found that the
[SPEAKER_01]: that the cannabis aphid, the bong aphid,
the only other plant that they're as
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in as the cannabis plant is the
fireweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really notice that just just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, if we're thinking
about the plants mitigating themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: into the next year, what about the idea
that they're feeling our energy every time
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're in the gardens and they start
mitigating new, you know, chemo types to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to help us out in the years
coming?
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have I just happened to go through
Yellowstone, I think, like about six to
[SPEAKER_10]: eight months after they had some very
terrible fires there in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I was on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to remember what year it
was.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say it was 92, but it might have
been 93.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I remember is that when when you
look at the areas of the of the forest
[SPEAKER_10]: that were scorched by the fire,
if you got down on your hands and knees
[SPEAKER_10]: and you looked, there was a whole new
forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like everything that was huge and big was
now just small, like all these low to the
[SPEAKER_10]: ground plants were all there and obviously
plants that were living off of the carbon
[SPEAKER_10]: from the soot and all the burnt trees and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the forest was just, you know,
replenishing itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: And kind of what we were saying before on
whether or not it's really climate change
[SPEAKER_10]: or is this just this cyclic nature that
the the fire and the burning of the
[SPEAKER_10]: vegetation kind of creates the next soil
for the next forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just is this natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how unfortunate for us people like
Wade, whose house is like right in the way
[SPEAKER_10]: of this natural process that's been
happening for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, oh, by the way, now it's
inconveniencing humans because we're
[SPEAKER_10]: putting our homes in these beautiful
places that this happens to.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really true.
[SPEAKER_13]: One important reflection that I've come
across this year we've talked about before
[SPEAKER_13]: is like living outside of major cities and
major like cities are toxic, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: and when they burn that ash isn't really
like it's not good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's it's toxic.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when cars burn and houses burn
and propane tanks go off, that ash is
[SPEAKER_13]: detrimental to us for forest fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ash is isn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it is as part of our natural
process.
[SPEAKER_13]: That ash is carbon.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to go in.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's part of our evolution.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's part of what we need with the
mass sickness and the pandemic and all of
[SPEAKER_13]: that that's going on is another reason
why, you know, cities are, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: something to be careful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And another reason where if if you can
make it work out in the country and live
[SPEAKER_13]: their life, even though there's sicknesses
out there, even though there's forest
[SPEAKER_13]: fires, making it through that is a
healthier process.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm feeling really thankful for my
country roots back to the land decisions
[SPEAKER_13]: right now, even though I know that we are
in the forest and anything can happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still allying with natural compounds,
and I'm feeling really healthy from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm feeling for those people who are
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, people that don't have the
choice because, you know, we've been set
[SPEAKER_01]: up for, you know, 100 plus years,
200 years that, you know, now people have
[SPEAKER_01]: their roots in the cities and that's where
now culture is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we just have to see both sides.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they serve their purpose.
[SPEAKER_13]: I go to cities, cities are, you know,
but I just recognize like there's a point
[SPEAKER_13]: of health that comes from living on on the
land, even with fires burning and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, and also smoke travels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we could we didn't see the sun
up here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: for over a week, like a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a big orange globe because of all
of the fires down in Oregon and California
[SPEAKER_01]: and Washington and Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were told we were down in Washington
and we didn't really have any fires around
[SPEAKER_01]: us at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we couldn't see the bottom of our
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just like how our collective
consciousness, we are all connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also all connected in this
microbiome that we call Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the smoke that's happening
down in California is the smoke that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always like to separate ourselves
that we are not in it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smokes and that are happening over
in China or over in Siberia that went on
[SPEAKER_01]: forever and ever, of course, are affecting
all of us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's it's important to recognize just
south of the border, whole towns burnt
[SPEAKER_13]: down from Spokane to central Washington,
all the way through Oregon, all the way
[SPEAKER_13]: through California.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, probably close to seven or eight
million acres have burned in the last
[SPEAKER_13]: month on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: What air in North America up here in
Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's I was I'm not a racist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see 15 feet in front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to breathe up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're talking about those headaches
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting to really associate the
headaches and how I've just been so down
[SPEAKER_05]: the last couple of weeks of suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to breathe out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an avid sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's it's right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look outside coming home last night
through Manning Park and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just smell it just like it's it's
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the smoke is bad up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So take a lot of the advice you guys are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those supplements and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really think about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's definitely a lot of smoke in
the air up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kava Kava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we we all a lot of us, you know,
we're all outlying with cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great analogies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Kava Kava is a wonderful
nerve vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really helps sort of coat the end of
our nerves that are sort of frayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that feeling of feeling frayed
and at the end of your rope, we use that
[SPEAKER_01]: term all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the end of my rope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's your nerves talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nerves are literally at the end of
their rope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So allying with Kava Kava and not just
smoking cannabis, but also ingesting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we ingest it, it's much more of a
nerve vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps coat the end of the nerves.
[SPEAKER_13]: So analogies and me.
[SPEAKER_13]: So so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Kava Kava and me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get away from my Gulf War syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was dealing with the overtoxin
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I studied on what they used in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used, you know, especially miso soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Kava Kava, I got turned on to as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those changed my life,
you know, especially if I'm having
[SPEAKER_02]: permanent nerve damage when I have really
bad nerve days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kava Kava works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that wonderful aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This microbe that is in, is in miso.
[SPEAKER_13]: Aspergillus orase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspergillus orase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always talk about aspergillus as
being the enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, here is this highly
intelligent microbe that really is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Transmitter that actually has Kava Kava.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that you're talking about this,
this is a lot of my amino acid papers and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am actually taking that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have been taking it recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to jump back into the vitamin
cover and open that thing up and jump
[SPEAKER_05]: right into what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to hop in here again quick
since we're talking about fires and I see
[SPEAKER_15]: comments over here in the comment thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is all the Oregon outdoor trash?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is all the Cali weed trash?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the first year I moved out here,
the first time I went into a dispensary
[SPEAKER_15]: was right after all the fires and
Calaveras.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got to say every single jar of weed
I smelled, smelled like smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what happened there that that
happened, but I've never seen that sense.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen cannabis completely smoked the
hell out and come off the line smelling
[SPEAKER_15]: and tasting just fine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a lot of people are going to go
into the peroxide and lemon juice and
[SPEAKER_15]: baking soda dips this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: Personally, I'm not sure where I am on how
clean the cannabis is coming out of these
[SPEAKER_15]: fires if it's not treated versus treated.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's something that we really need
to concern ourselves with or if it's kind
[SPEAKER_15]: of one of those, you know, you're already
combusting something, you're already
[SPEAKER_15]: smoking something that, you know,
cannabis has its positive medical effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's be honest, you are doing damage
to your body.
[SPEAKER_15]: Your lungs by doing that.
[SPEAKER_15]: What else are we ingesting by smoking that
cannabis that is out in those fields?
[SPEAKER_15]: I personally don't feel it's ruined.
[SPEAKER_15]: I in 2017 with the Santa Rosa fires,
we had stuff that got ash.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had stuff that didn't get ash.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had stuff that had smoke, no smoke,
all that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We did multiple different ways of
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: We did the dip on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't do the dip on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: We washed some stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't wash some stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: We all tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had a very clean results come back
that year.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a few, you know, you get the odd
ones like, oh, chloroform or whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they tell you, just send it back in
and retest it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it came back clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've kind of always been the mode of
thinking that it's not doing as much
[SPEAKER_15]: damage, I think, as the end consumer kind
of thinks.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they all just thinks barbecue OG
and all that crap and that we're smoking
[SPEAKER_15]: poison.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if any of you guys have any
more insight on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: The ash that falls, what's falling if it's
ash onto the plant itself is typically
[SPEAKER_10]: just, you know, again, very, very light
mineral content and very, very little,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, in terms of toxicity.
[SPEAKER_10]: The toxicity and what we were referring to
before is the way that these, a city fire
[SPEAKER_10]: would smell as opposed to say like a
country fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in a country, you might just be
burning brush in a culvert or something
[SPEAKER_10]: like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in a city.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably going to be like a lot of
trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bad part of smoke, the thing that can
contaminate cannabis would be what's in
[SPEAKER_10]: the soot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's in the soot, there's a class of
compounds called polycyclic aromatic
[SPEAKER_10]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are like some of the most toxic
hydrocarbons known to man, but ironically,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is part of the, the barbecue flavor
that, that people love.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you like barbecued brisket or
smoked brisket, or if you like,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, not to talk about the meat diet
again markets, but if you like charcoal
[SPEAKER_10]: grilled food, those black stripes on your
steak and everything like that,
[SPEAKER_10]: where it actually caramelizes a lot of
that degradation, you know, sugar
[SPEAKER_10]: degradation and whatnot, pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ends up with these polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, which are really toxic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why you could probably go to a
Burger King, go scrape those black lines
[SPEAKER_10]: off the hamburger, send it to a lab,
go show that there's polycyclic aromatic
[SPEAKER_10]: hydrocarbons in there and shut down Burger
King because they're selling toxic
[SPEAKER_10]: hamburgers because, but that's part of the
grilled taste that humans love so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but, but Mark, with cannabis,
that's not part of the taste and smell
[SPEAKER_06]: that we love.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could taste and smell it,
I wouldn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just talking about like the elements
of fire mixing with cannabis and where,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember, I love a good burger or a
good steak and I liked them grilled.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know exactly what you're talking
about and say, I love eat, but with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, I got a choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I could smell it or taste it,
meaning the fires, I don't want that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I got to agree.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it smells like smoke, I mean,
nobody's going to want it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking to stuff that comes out and
doesn't smell like smoke, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: So like when we were talking about this on
Hash Church a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_10]: when fires were happening in California,
I thought what I remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the nice thing about Hash Church,
we can go back and watch them now and go,
[SPEAKER_10]: listen to that is I think there were a
couple of episodes where, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's all these fires.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be all this smoky weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a couple of episodes later where,
yeah, there's a bunch of smoky weed out on
[SPEAKER_10]: the market to a couple of episodes later
to where, Hey, it makes really good fire
[SPEAKER_10]: oil, you know, to where, again,
you know, if you're making distillate,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're going to purify any smokiness out
of the distillate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying that all that material was
destined for distillate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly I think the way that most,
the economics of most grows would be like,
[SPEAKER_10]: you want to sell your premium flour,
your best flour at a different rate than
[SPEAKER_10]: you want to sell, say like your bulk
biomass, which is just going for,
[SPEAKER_10]: for distillate or just oil formation,
you know, for, for Rick Simpson type oils
[SPEAKER_10]: or things again, where maybe flavor really
doesn't matter, but those, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids are still going to be in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, in some crudes, there's almost
like a smoky flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, I mean, I've tasted some crews that
almost have like, I wouldn't say a smoky
[SPEAKER_10]: essence to it, but maybe like a somewhat
of like a burnt essence to it,
[SPEAKER_10]: where maybe in the way that they're
recovering or solve it from their
[SPEAKER_10]: extraction, actually put some kind of like
burnt flavor into the oil itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still effective.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I still think you could make capsules
out of it and cancer patients could still
[SPEAKER_10]: use that oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to answer your question,
I mean, I don't know that again,
[SPEAKER_10]: the burn, all the premonition that,
oh, any weed that's grown in a fire ridden
[SPEAKER_10]: zone is just written off as not being good
or as valuable as it would be otherwise.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the fire has to be like within a
mile of your property and dumping fucking
[SPEAKER_13]: ash on your weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like in that case, you know, I mean,
that's going to be tough to get that off.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when it has a chance to get somewhat
cleansed in the atmosphere, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_13]: there's some molecular change that's
happening in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you're next to a crowning fire,
I mean, my goodness, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: what can you expect?
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think when it has a chance to fill
up the atmosphere and the odd ash is
[SPEAKER_13]: falling, which is probably still the
majority of people, although this is a
[SPEAKER_13]: unique year, we'll see what happens,
but I think you're right to say that it's
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely a lot of it's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Soot is usually black.
[SPEAKER_10]: Soot would have like, think of soot is
kind of like the component that is left on
[SPEAKER_10]: the inside of your chimney.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you have to get your chimney
clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when soot builds up there,
essentially it could basically just be,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, flammable later on.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's oily.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's oily.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like, it's kind of like,
well, it's soot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Creosote, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So ash is different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like ash, again, if you were to do the-
It's absorbable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: In a different way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think ash is as much of an issue
as if your plants are kind of in an area
[SPEAKER_10]: where they're getting fumigated with the
sooty flames and effigy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the effluent of a fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?
Right?
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mark, would it be like spraying
geranium oil and then letting that kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: happen naturally and break down naturally?
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it would just, the smell goes
away and it breaks down over time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would imagine similar things are
happening with light ash.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had no reports from anyone that I'm
close with that they've had any smoky-
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, leaf microbes are still
eating things that land on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have an opportunity,
like those plants are still growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the fire went away, then I believe,
you know, then the plant, the stomata and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything, you know, every minute of
every day is consuming what's on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the plant does have the ability to
consume a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do know that during fire and when
there's a lot of ash that the
[SPEAKER_01]: cyanobacteria on the surface of the leaf,
you know, exponentially doubles,
[SPEAKER_01]: triples, you know, it starts to grow
because there is so much dust for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that there is, you know,
some type of a homeostasis balance that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens with outdoor flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one thing that I wanted to say
that's super easy for people to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were talking about city fire and
forest fire is that the smoke coming off
[SPEAKER_01]: of city fire is carbon monoxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smoke coming off of a forest fire is
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sorta- Well, they're both.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're both there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's telling you that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who said that to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that not true that there's more carbon
monoxide in city air?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, combustion makes both CO2 and CO.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've, yeah, there's no rational basis for
that chemistry-wise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So combustion- I agree with you,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: What about- I agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Atmospheric carbon coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no, in the air, there wouldn't
be like some type of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: city toxicity in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is, from plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if my laptop here were to fall into
a fire and start burning, most of this
[SPEAKER_10]: plastic is a thermoplastic called,
well, it's vinyl, which is polyvinyl
[SPEAKER_10]: chloride.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when polyvinyl chloride or when
styrene, all the conventional plastics,
[SPEAKER_10]: multiple plastics that we use,
when those things burn, yeah, they give
[SPEAKER_10]: off basically, they thermally degrade and
give off very noxious soots and
[SPEAKER_10]: particulates that you don't want to be
breathing in.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_10]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's down to the CO,
CO2 mixture.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just down on what you're burning.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of that stuff, again, especially the
polymers, what happens is as they burn,
[SPEAKER_10]: the neighboring polymer next to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if this part of the plastic is burning,
this part of the plastic is melting and
[SPEAKER_10]: vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why when you throw plastic into
like a campfire, you start to see little
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of like floaties all over the place
and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And will those toxins join together with
carbon pieces and chain off?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what they're going to do
though?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just going to end up in the upper
atmosphere as just, you know, volatiles
[SPEAKER_10]: that you don't want to be burning.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't, certainly I saw people
throwing trash into a fire and then
[SPEAKER_10]: cooking marshmallows on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh my God, people just,
you know, I mean, you know, part of it is
[SPEAKER_10]: having, again, this cradle to grave
recognition that all the packaging
[SPEAKER_10]: material and everything that we throw away
into the trash, a lot of it does get
[SPEAKER_10]: burned.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of that stuff does have bad
effects in the environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a chemist in here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's another thing I've been talking
about that you can probably clarify more.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was horrible at chemistry.
[SPEAKER_15]: So like horrible.
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing that people have been
talking about up here on and on and on and
[SPEAKER_15]: on is water plus ash equals lye.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's that going to do to plants?
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that going to do to soil?
[SPEAKER_15]: I've gotten into a couple of
conversations.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wendy from Sonibus.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you guys know Wendy Dragonfly,
and she's kind of the one that brought
[SPEAKER_15]: this up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she shut the comments down on her post
about it because I think she knew it was
[SPEAKER_15]: going to create hubbub.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, what sort of concentration
of ash needs to land on the soil for it to
[SPEAKER_15]: cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_15]: And at this point in the season,
my thing was I'm not even concerned
[SPEAKER_15]: because my plants are big enough at this
point.
[SPEAKER_15]: There ain't a damn bit of ash hitting the
soil underneath them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure there is, obviously.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you recognize, it's all concentration.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all a matter of how much that stuff
is there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so little there that it's
never going to be able to balance what
[SPEAKER_10]: acid rain has done.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So acid rain has basically moved the pH
needle on what comes down from the sky
[SPEAKER_10]: almost by a whole pH unit in the last 30
years.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, yeah, bring on the lye.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole lot of acid written in
neutral.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was exactly the argument is it was
going to change the pH in your soil and
[SPEAKER_15]: that you need to watch out for that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_10]: In a local sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just add this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you take a bunch of ash and you add
it into your grow, yeah, on a local sense,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're going to see a swing of pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So lye, again, some of the components in
there are like sodium and lithium.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they get wet, combined with
water, they make hydroxides, which is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to basically increase the pH and
give you a more basic pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like lye would.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, again, everything's all in,
you know, the stuff's floating down from
[SPEAKER_10]: the sky, for Christ sakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like people are dumping pounds of
this shit on your grow, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what I thought.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not Mount St. Helens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I mean, Mount St. Helens is,
yeah, I mean, something like that is going
[SPEAKER_10]: to, you know, that was, yeah, it was
great.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a Grateful Dead show going on in
Eugene, I think, when Mount St. Helens.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was Portland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Meadows, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and they were fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: They played fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was really fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, that was, well, I mean,
I guess in and around.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, a lot of what we know about
how volcanoes and replenish the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_10]: has been some of the publication that's
come from the science that's studied Mount
[SPEAKER_10]: St. Helens.
[SPEAKER_10]: And looked at, like, the neighboring areas
quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, you know, terrified back into,
you know, organic existence.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was going to say,
Mark, was that at first on a volcano
[SPEAKER_06]: slope, nothing will grow for the first
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But after that, it grows better than the
surrounding part of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a whole zoo of microbes that
start inhabiting that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once the microbes start, I mean,
Josh and Kelly will agree that it creates
[SPEAKER_10]: basically the chemistry of soil inside
what was just an inorganic, glassy,
[SPEAKER_10]: rocky substrate, completely void of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it takes that thing and just
turns it into, yeah, just a sponge in the
[SPEAKER_10]: zoo of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: So so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mother Nature is pretty good chemist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an excellent cannabis from volcanic
soil, like in Hawaii and other places.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to circle back to something that
was being offered about ash that settles
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants over the last couple of years
with the fires and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked some of the growers who had
crops out when ash was going on or when
[SPEAKER_00]: they were threatened by fire and the folks
who took their crop down while ash was
[SPEAKER_00]: still falling and they were concerned
their crop was going to burn or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_00]: reported more problems with their finished
product versus those who left their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ground, allowed them to continue
their life process and harvested after
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd had a chance to deal with the ash
was something that you were saying that I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I was trying to understand how
that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what else folks have.
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of problems did they have with
the material that they took down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was taste, taste and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower didn't taste nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burned poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was over near Santa Rosa when the
urban area of Santa Rosa burned a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the farmers in that area are who I
was talking to and yeah, they were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to save their crop, got it down and into a
drying facility away from the fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but were real disappointed with the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas some other farmers, again,
not urban, so there's a variable that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be relevant or it may be, but these
were more rural farmers who let their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff finish after the smoke had cleared
more or less, there was not the ash fall
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did with blowers and whatnot and they
felt like they got a really good harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there ash in the hash?
[SPEAKER_13]: It turns out leaf blowers are good for
blowing tear gas away from you.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're also really good at blowing ash
off your weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So wow, leaf blowers are turning out
important this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: 2020 is like the year of the leaf blower.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there ash in the hash?
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you firsthand, if there's not
too much ash on the starting material,
[SPEAKER_15]: it can pretty much be washed out and
tested clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there is a phyto
remediation that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I would think, just that when
you're curing, it is such a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation process that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your microbiology has changed
dramatically as like it would after a fire
[SPEAKER_01]: and you had a tremendous amount of ash,
then you're going to have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial colony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get a different type of
cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you said, Wade, I think people should
just hold off, let mother nature take care
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, especially those who are working
with deep soil and microbiology and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of regenerative practices around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think their flower is absolutely going
to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody who's listening out there,
just because we're talking about the smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ash damage, of course,
there's going to be amazing, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: small farm flower coming out of this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, just because you're hearing about
this doesn't mean don't go out and try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've already seen some flower that
was even just recently cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are having a lot of successes now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if the ash washes off into the hash
water, theoretically, again, to go back to
[SPEAKER_10]: this theory of lye, theoretically,
the pH of the water should increase
[SPEAKER_10]: because now you're dissolving all those
minerals, which are bases, and they
[SPEAKER_10]: basically make an increase in pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what would be interesting to see is in
your washings of ash-hash, do you actually
[SPEAKER_10]: see a higher pH of the water?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll grab the pH pen and let you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that would be good water to
sink into a compost pile or into the
[SPEAKER_13]: aisles of your garden to kind of sink that
ash-hash water.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell Wooksos if he works with anybody on
the legal spot to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's kind of what I was getting at
with the ash thing is where is that
[SPEAKER_15]: concentration point where you're really
going to see that?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, how much has, say, a 32-gallon
wash with 4,000 grams of material in
[SPEAKER_15]: there, what concentration of that needs to
be ash to actually change the pH of the
[SPEAKER_15]: water?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think what you would see is
you'd see a change.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're washing like, I don't know,
how much are you washing at a time,
[SPEAKER_10]: like five or 10 pounds?
[SPEAKER_15]: About 4,000 white grams a can,
so call it two pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, two pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you should see a little bit of
change in the pH, especially if it's got a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of ash in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You think it's that much?
[SPEAKER_04]: Two pounds from just four?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about two pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: 2225 gram conversion, which I've heard
somebody say that the BCC uses 2450,
[SPEAKER_15]: but then Flynn Wooksos laughed.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, the BCC doesn't have any.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any parameter on what's fresh frozen,
because you pay the weight, so they don't
[SPEAKER_15]: want to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just California 2225.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they've used forever.
[SPEAKER_15]: How accurate is that?
[SPEAKER_15]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just did a huge harvest at a friend's
farm, and one of his guys pulled some of
[SPEAKER_15]: the bags and dried it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And according to his numbers, it's 2,000
is far less than a pound.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're gaming with farmers,
too, you equate 2225 white grams to a
[SPEAKER_15]: pound, but that's untrammed, and that's
actually not equal.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's more like two thirds of a pound.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in their head, it's hard for them to
wrap around freezing weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the water weight and counting for
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be interesting to see,
again, is there a change in pH?
[SPEAKER_10]: And do the natural components of what else
is in the hash water somehow buffer that
[SPEAKER_10]: change in pH?
[SPEAKER_10]: So no matter how much ash is in there,
you won't really see a swing of pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one of the experiments you could run
is you can take your water after you've
[SPEAKER_10]: done your hashing and add ash to it and
see if you could change the pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: See if the natural components of what
you're extracting out of the plant is
[SPEAKER_10]: capable of basically masking the increase
in pH that you would see if there was ash
[SPEAKER_10]: in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, the way you do that is you
spike it with ash to see if you actually
[SPEAKER_10]: see the increase in pH.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to take a wild guess here,
but with the amount of ash I'm seeing on
[SPEAKER_15]: that size run, I would expect maybe a gram
or two of it to be ash out of the entire
[SPEAKER_15]: weight of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you just think about the
stoichiometry of how much you would need
[SPEAKER_10]: to add to swing the pH a little bit,
you're going to see a difference in pH.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can almost guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can report it back here on HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm all about figuring those things out
because I can't tell you how many times
[SPEAKER_15]: people ask me all these crazy questions of
what can be washed, what can't be washed,
[SPEAKER_15]: what should I bother with?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will sit here and admit that we've
washed some pretty crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that we could run it through testing or
just see for ourselves exactly what
[SPEAKER_15]: happens in the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: If people only realize their questions are
literally so they don't have to see what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens, it's such an insane thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, I don't want to make any
mistakes because mistakes lead to
[SPEAKER_04]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we can't have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to just ask everyone what,
oh, hey, just can tell me all your
[SPEAKER_04]: mistakes that you made.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't make those same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go out and make those very same mistakes
and make a bunch of new ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And come back and tell us all about the
innovation it led to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask me questions that keep you from
that journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a lot of those questions,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like, okay, how do I answer this?
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like that's one thing I've always,
I've always, no matter what anybody tells
[SPEAKER_15]: me, I have to find out for my own.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just stopped that years ago and throw
it through and see what we get.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not making mistakes in your
garden or figuring things out and dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: with different issues, you're never going
to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing I've always pushed my
plants to their limits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I leave plants in one gallon pots for
six months just to see what I can do with
[SPEAKER_05]: them, just so I can learn from it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can understand that.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you haven't botched a run, you haven't
done it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had everything, every problem known
to a gardener, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had scales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody's ever had scales.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I've shared enough about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you kind of deal with all those
problems, they're a great way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all there's ever been is just
research and understanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeing it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's still fighting powdery build.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I deal with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I deal with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you learn a whole lot more from an
experiment that doesn't work than from an
[SPEAKER_10]: experiment that does work.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do an experiment that works,
why did you do the experiment to begin
[SPEAKER_10]: with?
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't much of an experiment.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you knew if it was going to work,
research is what you do when you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way you put that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, we got seven more minutes for
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been great having everyone on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to let everyone know I'm
going to go and spend the rest of the day
[SPEAKER_04]: with my little son who's anxiously waiting
on the other side of the door there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, let's finish it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to say anything about
Horatio, feel free to now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might be a good time to mention a
little something something.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, anyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark Horatio is the reason why I became on
the panel at Hashtard.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you guys wouldn't know who I am and I
wouldn't know any of you people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I have to be grateful for his
friendship and for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: He reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never reached out to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: He reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I was I think he was like on his
phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: With me a couple of times while he was on
Haschurch and he'd like ask me a question
[SPEAKER_10]: and then he'd go back to Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_10]: So and then it just became natural.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Mark, why don't you come on?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think, Mark, did he introduce me
to you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to be grateful for how Haschurch
has enriched my life with all of your
[SPEAKER_10]: friendship.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I see the comments in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone seems to like when I pipe in with
knowledge and it's just my pleasure of my
[SPEAKER_10]: life to be here to share that knowledge
with you all and to be everyone's friend
[SPEAKER_10]: on this panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys mean a lot to me, kind of like my
Internet family.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really I have to be grateful for
Horatio for introducing me to you,
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus, and for your continued friendship
and Johnny's continued friendship and Sam
[SPEAKER_10]: and everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think what we find in life is
it's not like what you know and it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: necessarily who you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's like who you get to know and who
you bring into your circle and your the
[SPEAKER_10]: influence that you have amongst your
friends and the collective knowledge that
[SPEAKER_10]: you're able to share.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the old saying a rising tide
rises all boats.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think that's what Haschurch does
is it rises all boats.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so for my contribution here,
I'm directly thankful to Horatio for
[SPEAKER_10]: inviting me and bringing me in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I give thanks to Johnny B for introducing
me to Horatio and give thanks to Horatio
[SPEAKER_04]: for introducing me to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like I said, passing that spark
on down down the line and letting everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: get inspired.
[SPEAKER_04]: He definitely won't be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: His words are on Haschurch forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyone that wants to go and look those
up, I'm sure eventually someone will put a
[SPEAKER_04]: cool list together that has all of the
episodes that Horatio was ever on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, props, props to Horatio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else want to mention anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, go ahead, Jim, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came in, I think I came in on
episode 24 and Horatio was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I miss learning from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way he challenged thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way that he challenged ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his compassion, more than anything,
he was always willing to share and always
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to lend a hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always helping someone out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great spirit to have and one
that I hope to leave in my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry he's gone, but I'm thankful
to have known him and to have been a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of him and be a part of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just talking with Marnie and his
wife and daughter in between the Haschurch
[SPEAKER_05]: and she was watching this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say thank you to everybody here
and the kind words and just for all the
[SPEAKER_05]: support and the GoFundMe's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were really just really the whole
family was just so overwhelmed with all
[SPEAKER_05]: the comments from everybody from the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course Horatio was a good friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came to my house quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He helped me out a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like more than anybody, he made creams for
my neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made certain things for my pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: He really just was an extra way to help
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He helped people like Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: He created stuff from my freezer from the
wing meeting when he first started doing
[SPEAKER_05]: those extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's always just wanting to help that
next person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you always said, he was doing it
for his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything that he's done and just all
you guys out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really looking forward to seeing
more of his research.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know some people out there know Mark
and some other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen and worked with Horatio
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some stuff that all the barrels
are leaning there and just different
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what he was doing at the end,
he took a break and really focused on
[SPEAKER_05]: jewelry and wait to see the jewelry line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: His whole base was full of all jewelry,
making equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did some text that, of course,
Horatio would do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That no one else was done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look forward for Mario to releasing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be type of jewelry and stuff like
that that actually put together at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: of the last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why Horatio stopped talking
with everybody because he went deep into
[SPEAKER_05]: his passion, was into doing his art and
doing all these molds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you'll see some pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share today on Instagram when it's
over and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to head over there now and just
kind of do some helping out there and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the family is really grateful and
they're really I mean, the daughters just
[SPEAKER_05]: touched to see how much her father has
touched so many people and helped so many
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep those comments coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're reading them every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying thank you so much for the
support and everything that everybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: helped out for the family.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks Horatio for all you've done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know his spirit runs strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually got the freeze dryer and I
remember when he brought this over the
[SPEAKER_05]: border.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and how we got that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll always be here beside me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Johnny B for the touching words.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the family appreciates that
for sure, as do we.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else want to mention any words
before we shut her down and send a rest in
[SPEAKER_04]: peace to Horatio?
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know the guy personally,
but obviously I've been following him
[SPEAKER_15]: since day one on Ash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: But one thing I just want to share what
what I thought was cool about Horatio,
[SPEAKER_15]: not as somebody who didn't know him,
is you could tell that that guy,
[SPEAKER_15]: anything he got into, he fully geeked out
on went way for the fence, swung way for
[SPEAKER_15]: the fences all the way out there,
every detail.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that to me, that's cool, because
that's kind of the way I am when I get
[SPEAKER_15]: into something that's it's just full geek
mode.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can inspires me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and it teaches all of us that,
you know, you don't you don't you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: let your own limit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't limit yourself on your own
limitations.
[SPEAKER_10]: You set stretch goals.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're you're you're that you get down
on the head.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was he knew a lot more than he actually
really understood.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know what I mean, I mean,
he just he knew things instinctively in
[SPEAKER_10]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when he would call me and we would
talk, he would say things and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_10]: oh, yeah, there's a reason why that
happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I kind of explain it to
him.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it teaches us all the lesson
that, you know, we should achieve set our
[SPEAKER_10]: goals high.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if we don't hit that goal,
even if we fall just short of that goal,
[SPEAKER_10]: we'll go a lot farther than we probably
would have if we never set that goal to
[SPEAKER_10]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a good model to live your
life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to have the heart and faith.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to have the heart space while you do
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, a person like Horatio taught
us how to dive deep and to go beyond the
[SPEAKER_13]: realms and then how to have a quality with
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then to how to have the heart space.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I really appreciate about,
you know, him and this community and this
[SPEAKER_13]: moment right now is that, you know,
this is it's more than just a business for
[SPEAKER_13]: us.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's it's a connection and it's really
important to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are the things that keep us up
every day and waking up to go to go on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really love and appreciate you,
you all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big respect to Horatio, Johnny B.,
everyone here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you on this journey.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one day, one more day in our
evolution.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just appreciate you being out there
calling us.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we if you need anything ever,
we'll we'll call on you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to everyone out in chat and chat
land.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a part of this, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're on the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're all a part of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all a part of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Horatio.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mark Horatio really brought out the
creative and the science.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what I really gravitate
towards.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something that I, you know,
I really respect in terms of the work that
[SPEAKER_16]: he contributed to everyone and everyone
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember Marcus, you talking about
the processes and everything that he was
[SPEAKER_16]: going in on.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, to have a mind like that,
to your point, Mark, is is really special.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's that's a testament to being far
more interested in just processes.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's understanding the plant in a really
deep, deep way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Horatio in person just on the Internet
with on your show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I can say is he had a deep,
deep love for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of that, I had a lot of
respect for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, 40 years is not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it is is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll finish it off with a rest in peace
to you, Sir Horatio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were gone, but you will certainly not
be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for the time you spent with us
here at Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank all of you for all the time you
guys have spent here at Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_04]: both the panelists and all the people
watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have about four hundred and
twelve people in the chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we'll try and do this again real
soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to everyone on the West Coast
who's dealing with these fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try and get some help out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know the community is open to
arms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope that the rains come soon that
these fires are go down and more people's
[SPEAKER_04]: homes are saved rather than lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loveful.
[SPEAKER_13]: Say hi to Tanner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send hearts of love to everybody.
