[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we are at the Magic Fountain in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first places I ever came in
2004 was the Magic Fountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really cool spot to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some epic buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it's all turned off right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it turns on at night, but pretty
cool nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just walked around the Magic Fountain
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, this was one of the
first places I ever went to in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: At my first spannibus, which was before
spannibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually called La Fiera High Life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a gentleman, born and bred local to
Barcelona, said you must let me take you
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of my favorite spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a beautiful spot overlooking the
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see everything in the city in the
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't bring a tripod, however,
there's a small possibility I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes life works, sometimes it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to go for the it
doesn't methodology here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorta.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could break my camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try another option over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one looks a little better maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, is that sketchy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to go with what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, sketch is all I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could put it on this case, I think,
and it would be a little safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to pull this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to put this right on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be a little less
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull out some of the flavors that we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Masters of Rosin, which have been
substantial and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that I brought my dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a big pain in my butt if I
haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropping things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily there was nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My little lens cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and there's my dabber too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good, very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where we're upside down right
now, but oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that on there like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we'll be away to the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little crooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do our best that we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to take a quick dab here
because what a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't take a dab, I would be
remiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some of my tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here right now we're going to hit 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this was Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was one of the top three though
that plays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be hitting out of the legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carter too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll hit this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four, five on the top
button.
[SPEAKER_01]: She turns on.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gives you her little visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still got 60%, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only had 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I woke up this morning, I was kind of
lazy last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spaced putting it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a big one of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to finish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to finish these dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another one finished down the
tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push the top button again twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've turned it on and that ignites
the, uh, the, the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can really see the
screen, but it basically shows you at
[SPEAKER_01]: climbing in speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once it reaches temperature,
it basically, um, turns on a timer for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have not been putting water in mine
for the most part because it's going in
[SPEAKER_01]: and out of my bag very quickly,
but the water just becomes a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the Rossens of, uh,
masters of Rossens entries were absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to get my Q-tips out and do a
little bit of washing, cleaning,
[SPEAKER_01]: scooping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I actually pulled them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually the other pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of figured I did, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's easy to forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to clean this as soon as you're
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good rosin pipe too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a little bit of melt in and there
was some residuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, we're shaking now, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of residuals, but otherwise
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about how quick and easy you
can hit the Magna Carta.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the wind effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm going to leave that because
it's a trip there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut her down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a nice dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go find my buddy that I'm
traveling with and we will see you guys in
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is really drive around Barcelona on
motorcycles and puff is in as many cool
[SPEAKER_01]: spots as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see you at the next cool spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made it to the observation tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up on the hill in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't really tell, but it's pretty
beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't see through the trees though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just drove the beast here, the GS 310
BMW.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just drove it up this really nice
mountain highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could have shown it to you guys
on the GoPro, but I didn't bring my GoPro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice little restaurant up here,
La Venta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little castle church thing behind
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys' dogs are absolutely tripping
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick stop at Mirabl√≥ on the hill here in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs in the restaurant at Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we've got to wait 5 seconds for
this cartitude to heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that tastes like heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a snooker table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to send them over here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at his group.
[SPEAKER_02]: All balls for water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, recycling in Laos.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who made this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Brazil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these are from Brazil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tarsul Blais.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: J.P.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blais, Tarsul Blais.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get a little spin there?
[SPEAKER_02]: The new artist is brought in from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil Blais.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because it all looked
different to me and I didn't recognize any
[SPEAKER_01]: of it as any blowers that I would know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it looks like Scottie Mickles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a mandala style.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one piece, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a banjo almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banjo is what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with the... I didn't see the
girl in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's definitely inspired by banjo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good price.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's impressive.
Yeah, DMR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the flavor in that DNA jar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow, marble sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there alcohol up there or do I have to
fill it up here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there alcohol up there or do I have to
fill it up here?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's... Up there is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you take it in front of the piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you alone?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, to take things up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you open some of these?
[SPEAKER_03]: These smell fire, no?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some papaya right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those papaya ones are crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, see, I'm addicted to these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can open, close, open, close,
open, close.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't smoke, I only...
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, and it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still not, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm almost ready to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your rosin collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, open her up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He go third place in Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, very nice color.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third place in Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Third place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Si.

[SPEAKER_03]: That is the GM of him, but he go with the
pignaz, tang, tang genetics, some
[SPEAKER_03]: pineapple stirrups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you can... You want to see that

[SPEAKER_01]: This is some party balls, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Si, do you want to pay for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can pay for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pay 55 for 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.50.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give them to him now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give them to him.
