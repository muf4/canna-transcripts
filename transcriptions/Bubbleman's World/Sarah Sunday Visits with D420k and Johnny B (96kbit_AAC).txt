[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it's pre-puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Wednesday, is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's B.C.
Day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: Day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's B.C.
Day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Monday!
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've got Sarah Sunday visiting out
from the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not really the East Coast.
No.
[SPEAKER_08]: East from... Central?
[SPEAKER_08]: Central more, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ontario?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought Manitoba as central.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're our own... We talk about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: who hasn't... Geez, I guess I really
haven't made many shows.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not like he hasn't been on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just haven't been made.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually I've been doing some dry
sifting videos myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's going well for you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Teaching the wills, the ways of what I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ways of the sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of sift, I'm about to learn
a light, a pure hash spliff.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a beauty.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all just dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll to damn near perfection.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should really get in there at the
camera and show the camera what it looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring the camera a little closer so you
guys can see what we're talking about
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it grabbing it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it on the end so they can see the
little spiral.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a work of a masterwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a lot of art that goes into
making a pure hash joint, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely care and attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, my friend that makes them does a
wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been making them for like 12 years at
this point in time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's probably a really good
idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice little sizzle on the end of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that nice blue smoke coming off of it
instantly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very blue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice and dense looking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love how when you blew on that,
the smoke went through the other end.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like normally you blow on the end of a
joint and it just kind of goes to the
[SPEAKER_09]: other end.
[SPEAKER_09]: You blew on that and it just blew right to
the other end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you go, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will smoke this with care.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for this lovely welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chillin' out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, I have to say we've had a
pretty epic summer this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicer than usual.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, beautiful summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've definitely gotten Ontario's
weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've gotten your weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been shitty and cold and so cold at
night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a burn because the winter was so
harsh too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know, right?
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's barely got to 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, let me pass this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just got back from Jamaica and I
have to say it is, you know, as hot right
[SPEAKER_08]: now, right here as it was when I left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, as we left, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, because Jamaica,
what was it like?
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked like it rained a little bit
there for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a little bit of rain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hadn't rained in like over 13 weeks in
some of the parishes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were very, very happy to have that
rainfall there while we were there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course we were joking that we
brought the rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: We brought the rain, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rainmaker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Giddy actually told me that he had done
some turtle thing that he drew in the sand
[SPEAKER_08]: or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it was about some rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the ash on that, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should probably show the camera how
lovely the ash is.
[SPEAKER_08]: This color, I don't want to put it too
close because then we lose the sun,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's a nice white ash.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks very fine and like it would be
just like the lightest dust.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't really get a chance really.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can learn how we can all make our
own asteroids at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wouldn't that be great?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to know how.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to know all your tricks because
I'm sure you're very precise.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a post on Facebook that definitely
inspired a lot of people to do it and
[SPEAKER_08]: quite a few people have posted pictures
and whatnot, but I could probably do a
[SPEAKER_08]: video easy enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of waiting to talk to my friend
because I was really hoping I'm getting
[SPEAKER_08]: him to do it because he's the master.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I could do it, but he's the
master.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows the ratios of the quality of
resin that are required.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows the temperatures to meld them
together in the shapes and sizes that are
[SPEAKER_08]: needed, the thickness, how to roll it,
the whole nine yards, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lovely.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful when the ash you just hit
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so soft.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like dust.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you should do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I will one day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a matter of going back to the
Kootenays and visiting my friend Ron and
[SPEAKER_08]: when I'm visiting him, I'm going to go
visit my other friend who is nearby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two for one trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like, yeah, two birds, one stone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a two for one trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nowadays it's usually a four or five for
one trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really liking these, uh, these pure
hash joints.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nice thing to get back to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is perfect for me because I don't
like bugs really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not so much for, I mean, I could do,
I'd be enjoying the dabs of this morning
[SPEAKER_06]: because they haven't killed me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but this is up my alley.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inspiring me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: First time I ever saw those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought that's a great concept.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely, um, you gotta be very
careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's way tastier than, um, in any other
format.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because there's so much, it's a grant
of hash we're smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sounds reasonable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do that every day, multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I can.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, uh, I did a video of just smoking one
of these to my own head and it's almost my
[SPEAKER_08]: most popular video.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's only a month old.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm telling you, people are into this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: How big can you make these things?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you make a giant one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you need to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure giant hash joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make, let's see how big we can get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do them in steps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure out what's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to make a big one,
make it burn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at all these ideas coming back from
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love ideas.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should bring that up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about, it's all about hooking up
puffing bowls and puffing, puffing dupes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Surrounded by beautiful strings and
talking about our medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how the ideas flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to try something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got this little bug bite the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really itchy, so I'm definitely gonna
put some, um, a balm on it last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then today I was going to grab some
cream, give it a shot and see how it
[SPEAKER_08]: works.
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought some CBC cream back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm definitely gonna grab some CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBC.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBC cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_09]: From Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna put it on this little itchy
thing and I'll tell you about it on puff
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: In two days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that two days from now?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is two days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, craziness.
[SPEAKER_08]: How time flies when you're flying.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking we should go put the boat
in the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lured with hash and boat ideas,
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash and boat ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The boat might happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoking on the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe where's the, uh, this is
cracking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do the two, two finger, like put your
other finger on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it's more like, if you use one
finger, it'll just collapse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: It requires a technique.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, uh, the trick is really to try and
leave the ash on the cherry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to cool the cherry down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have to take this phone call.
[SPEAKER_08]: While we're on the video?
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought he was, I thought he was serious
there for a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm gonna take this phone
call.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cause the joint count passed the
other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just did it as soon as you said
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, obviously you don't have
time for the joint either.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: The best thing about the hash joint is
when it comes apart, we can still throw
[SPEAKER_09]: that in the bong and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's even better.
[SPEAKER_08]: No waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny, I've posted me smoking a few
of these and people are like, oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you didn't smoke paper bubble,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just funny when people are so
convinced in their, what they think is a
[SPEAKER_08]: reality there.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, think before you speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's quite nice to be able to smoke
up your hash joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now as the glass time, we tried it on the
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we dump it in the water?
[SPEAKER_09]: We should now try.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, last time I jumped in the water with
this whole thing in my pocket and then we
[SPEAKER_08]: smoked it at, uh, the seven sales in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy cactus club there in front of the
planes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we're going to go do the boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll catch up with you when we get to the
boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right guys, we have jumped in the
boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: John and Sarah behind me here,
kind of trying to get them between my
[SPEAKER_08]: head.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both sort of too close to,
no, John that way, Sarah that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're fitting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just jumped in the water here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were about to head out to Horseshoe Bay
out yonder.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see it's damn near a perfect day
out there on the house sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure feels like a perfect day.
It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the Luskiti Island shrimping
vessel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we're going to go for a little
boat ride here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll share a little bit of it with you
while we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And otherwise we'll see when we get to
Horseshoe Bay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this
[SPEAKER_08]: the local area here?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the office, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Lions Bay office.
[SPEAKER_11]: 417.
[SPEAKER_08]: 417, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess it's time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to do a little 420 ripper on
this Monday afternoon with Sarah Sunday
[SPEAKER_08]: and John Berfello, bubble man,
in the house sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we put on some music?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you gear up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go put some tunes on.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, one minute warning to
420.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting out here on the house sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't find my tripod, so I am the
tripod.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are happy 420?
[SPEAKER_08]: 420, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we all use the herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, bam, boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tasty is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez, all these beautiful things to choose
from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to take this giant ball.
[SPEAKER_08]: He went right for the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_08]: For more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I don't have seasickness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: No beeline?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got to have beeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course Johnny's got beeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: That lighter just won't be for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always use beeline when I can.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do ever see me sucking on a
lighter, it happens the odd time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because he had to maintain his focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to have standards.
[SPEAKER_12]: And everybody has their standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it works better than the lighter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely cleaner.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The song just said it all for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to get back in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your research and see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And long life, and long life, and long
life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some local kids just out having a good
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a good life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm almost ready to have a swim
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've got to go eat some food in
Horseshoe Bay, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we do that first and then come
swim?
[SPEAKER_01]: Swim and eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat and swim?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to swim on a full stomach?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B jumped the gun.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there goes Sarah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys aren't messing around.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's refreshing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have to say that Jamaica's water
was a lot warmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Refreshing, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but this water is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been in the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before my accident, it's been at least
eight or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You sure picked a good day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just jumped in with the cold water.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to jump in with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Backward flip.
[SPEAKER_11]: The backward flip.
[SPEAKER_11]: For Tony Ripton, backward flips do not hit
your head.
[SPEAKER_11]: For Tony Rips and backward flips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, backward flips.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine if my camera rolled into the ocean
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would have been like, oh, it's so nice,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't even this is barely refreshing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is me hesitating.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I want to get in the water?
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, if you want to feel refreshing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pin drop about six feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like hold your arms and pin
drop.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go down four or five feet,
you'll feel it on your feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 20 degrees different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You feel it scuba diving fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You feel that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it substantial or what the hell?
Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm going to go down 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Swimming in the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to do it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be seated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy B.C.
Day.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called B.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: Living.
[SPEAKER_11]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: Life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_06]: Life.
[SPEAKER_06]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_06]: Life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I was living here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to go that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not quite this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you look over there and Buddy's
just like surfing behind his boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very good lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: My children were born over there on the
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: In that neighborhood with the White House.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: That kid looks like he's having a blast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have all the equipment to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got to say that was pretty damn
nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little backflip into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you guys saw that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was off camera, but it landed quite
nicely on my face.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was quite, quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I think I'm going to get these
guys rounded up and head into Horseshoe
[SPEAKER_08]: Bay.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a little bit of a chop out there,
so we're going to need a little bit more
[SPEAKER_08]: time than I thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's warm in this spot right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder why.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I took a big piss there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that why it's foamy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Stepping off the boat onto the dock here
at Horseshoe Bay with Sarah and John.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we head up for some fish and chips?
[SPEAKER_08]: Fish and chips.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think of that BC ferry as we
pulled up?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing looked like the Bloody Love
boat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was waving and puffing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, lots of people were waving,
hey?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was waving.
[SPEAKER_06]: John was waving like the queen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was waving everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they were waving back.
[SPEAKER_06]: They enjoyed the tunes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even have the top speaker,
so they probably didn't really hear them
[SPEAKER_08]: very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they were for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold left.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a boat house.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's the boat house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty fancy restaurant.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to eat really nice food,
we can go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I say we do go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want the boat house?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's go to the boat house.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so much nicer than fish and chips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus you can get fish and chips there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally down.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, this is a bit fast foodish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been to the boat house in so
long and that deck just called my name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the full experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll head to the boat house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Recheck it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that we're both at the same level
of excitement.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see bubbles.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll look at them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see people swimming in disgusting water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe go over there, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how clean it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that looks okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Murky.
It's murky.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we just got to the boat
house here, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got this awesome menu.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see some of the things on the menu
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did we get?
[SPEAKER_08]: We got some coconut shrimp and some ahi
tuna tacos.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we'll get some comments on the
radioactivity of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the ocean is radioactive, I hate to
tell you, but the rest of the world is
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to stay out of the ocean
and just stay in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes in the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes into everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're drinking it right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This restaurant is right on the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the ferry that we just passed
and a little island with some arbutus
[SPEAKER_08]: trees out front.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, real nice spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of these classic BC spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've ever come to BC and stayed at
Horshey Bay for a short period of time
[SPEAKER_08]: through the ferry transfer, this is where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be eating soon, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, the food just got here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it look?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three piece halibut and fries.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three piece halibut and fries.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went for the salmon burger and fries.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to eat, so bon appetit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're just finishing up dinner here
and we figured, hey, how about a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of dessert?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking out the new pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, it's very easy to stuff
and fill.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was tasty, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that a tasty sound?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, it was really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to have this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, going for the ahu tuna taco.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really tasty, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just kind of sitting here
chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a nice little toy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, BC Ferry in the background
taking off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was a big rib.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we are sitting on the outside here,
so it's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wearing the 90s, smoking the 90s.
[SPEAKER_08]: My ribs just rolling behind you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually some dry set.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: That I got from The Great Garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: They cleaned for The Great Garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like The Great Garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it just the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a wonderful experience,
as usual.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were hanging out with Matt?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, Matt and Sarah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw them both at Jacob's wedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for me to get some dessert.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big rib.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah just released a big rib.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd blow it straight up, because that's a
lot of smoke right now sitting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at how much smoke that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy Johnny chimney.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny chimney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm professional.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny chimney?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, we're not on the chimney.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_08]: CCHQ.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here comes another ferry.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just never stop, do they?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a long weekend in BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, ferry lineups must be brutal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Heading back over to the boats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Vines Bay life.
[SPEAKER_06]: BC life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: when you get a random friend, what do you
say, John?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Piper needs a... Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting a call?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Birds calling me.
[SPEAKER_08]: How awesome is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hitting this... Bird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, bird.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am on the Pacific Ocean, floating in a
boat, hitting an apex pen.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the apex.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Straight on.
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of coil is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what's the resistance on the coil?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the resistance on the coil?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're on my video right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm filming a video right now and you're
on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bird is on the phone with me.
Here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got you on speaker.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on speaker, bird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You sent a care pack?
Oh, yeah, I sent the care pack to Jamaica.
It will be getting there on the 11th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jamaica will be having APEC plans,
APEC plans, APEC plans.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the whole crew lined up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fully,
fully.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, bird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hi to Giddy, say hi to Tony,
and we'll talk real soon, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: You bet, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that was a nice little call to
get from Bird while we're filming here on
[SPEAKER_08]: the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see it's just a perfect fricking
day out here right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you guys feeling back there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apex and out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, about 15 pence and out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reach for the apex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're back here on my deck.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a bit of a boat experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it was an experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaker fell in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a little, it's like a 35 pound
speaker that fell off my tower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just missed Sarah, bounced off the side of
the boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never forget saying, what was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you guys going, where's your
speaker?
Your speaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a helmet or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: A big black thing brushing at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see this thing, goof.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing was heavy too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a heavy speaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was in contact with my head,
it would've like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, it would be at the
hospital right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we absolutely would have been
reconstructed surgery.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be at the hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: With the camera, John and I are here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Warden Squamish, BC.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to finish off the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah, Sarah was having such a good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: BC, you got my dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here's your dabber.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I was going to do for you was
Meddy, My Little Pony, or the astronaut.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will take anything and all of the above.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's start over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Full grade in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a first bounce this morning,
which of course I did a video on the other
[SPEAKER_10]: day for my safety Sundays.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love giving away that hash because
as Sarah knows and as he's about ready to
[SPEAKER_10]: explain that taste though, the first
bounce.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I love my dry sift screens.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're useful.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're extremely useful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really liked that ceramic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Insert.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a little bit different from the
one that sat on the top.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait before that one's actually inside
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what happened was the other
one sat on the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you notice how this is a little taller
right here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was going to put a screen on top
of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked them to shave this down so it was
even with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: When they shaved this down, it made this
fatter and so this no longer went inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this won't fit in my other tie nail
top, but it fits in the one that has not
[SPEAKER_08]: been shaved down.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Sarah, we're all going to do a hit
of Medi here and then we're going to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: hit of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll allow Mark to come in on that for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a bit of a trick to it in the
sense that if you don't get it off,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you hold it over the tie nail for any
amount of time, it melts to the skillet
[SPEAKER_08]: tool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to say it melts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you've got to scoop it off the
titanium and the whole trip is that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: hitting it off the ceramic and it is a
different tasting hit subtly, but it's
[SPEAKER_08]: still different going down the line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I clean the skillet tool as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We always talk about clean, clean your
skillet tool before you pass on the next
[SPEAKER_05]: person.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have seen it in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony opened up all these beautiful hashes
and I looked inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like flow OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just all like, like a dirty skillet
tool that I put in there like four or five
[SPEAKER_08]: times to perfect hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurt my soul.
[SPEAKER_08]: We puffed it nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is just an OC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an OCD thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the thing that I kind of laughed
about is when you like, where's the Bruce
[SPEAKER_10]: Banner?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this same thing happened in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one little hit that Tony saved me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I, I pressed it out and I put it
on top of my D nail and it was there for
[SPEAKER_08]: days when I put it, pulled it off of the D
nail and put it on like the top of a,
[SPEAKER_08]: a little container.
[SPEAKER_08]: Giddy up came in and puffed like 80 to 90%
of it, which was like totally legit that
[SPEAKER_08]: his nose found the sweet piece and that he
was, but it was one I, I just kept
[SPEAKER_08]: forgetting that like when you're puffing
with a big group of people and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything's game, they're going to want
the same thing that you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, but the funny thing was,
and I share all my stuff evenly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just something that Tony said,
I saved this for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been saving this for a year for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one little hit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I turned around and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost all gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when we were, no, it was
actually Amsterdam and the Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone actually took it all and put it
into a joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I laugh so hard because this
had already happened previously almost a
[SPEAKER_10]: year ago with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they mixed it with tobacco too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was even the worst part of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But listen, but it's got a funny thing was
Tony was upset.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like, but then he was like,
Oh, I rolled it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, where's that house?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, I rolled it into a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: You rolled it into a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's puff it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then Tony took a hit of it and it was
full of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then he was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of those things that for me,
when you said it on your last trip in
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica, I personally, I was like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: I laughed out loud so hard watching that
video yesterday because I know the story.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the second time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be the astro boy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's got a kick.
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew this oxyprotectable resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew it between the temperatures of 65
at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kept my humidity around 30%.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of like, now I talked about
growing at a lower temperature to try and
get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: After David Allen told us that growing at
a lower temperature, it was 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: David Allen mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And well, even before that, I said,
I was very interested in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never did anything in regards to it
because I don't have the air conditioning
[SPEAKER_08]: units or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I run a very simple thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The system in summertime is not an option
for me, but I'd love the idea of a cold
[SPEAKER_08]: room grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, this is the cold room grow
experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an idea with the my little pony
dessert hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: That astro boy too will give you almost an
anxiety as high like that C 99 sort of,
[SPEAKER_10]: some people hit it and they're just like,
okay, so you want to enjoy that astro boy
[SPEAKER_08]: high and then hit them for a couple
minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sit back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the shade now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had, if you notice, we Jerry rigged
the, um, the towel on top of the umbrella.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's giving us, it's giving us shade
certain level of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not too hot anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This, at this point in time, I just lean
back and get down here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we've got our ice water.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've definitely had a nice hashy day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today is BC day and we did it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would first swim in the Pacific ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: First time in years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the best part about it is two weeks
ago, I was swimming in the ocean in
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was there with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's like twice in almost 30 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds good vibes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always had the urge to swim in the
ocean when it was near.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was one of the reasons why I wanted
to live in the ocean.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, people don't think about it too much,
but when you look at the ocean,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a freedom to get, you can go in that
ocean on a boat and literally go anywhere
[SPEAKER_08]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have the proper vessel,
that's basically, that's why the roads
[SPEAKER_08]: don't even do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go anywhere and that is a great
way of looking at terrifying to sail out
[SPEAKER_06]: into the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, considering what you said,
it was a good day that we only had the
[SPEAKER_06]: speaker come down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't too much money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ripped all the way to Horseshoe
Bay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was so fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm all like super paying attention,
making sure there's no, it's the ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you guys out there that have
boats on lakes, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's killer whales in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't see any.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but they jumped out of the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: We saw an eagle though, remember?
[SPEAKER_08]: We did see a bald eagle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw a seal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did see that seal too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt bad actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause when we were on Boyer, I probably
could have just gone around the island and
[SPEAKER_08]: showed you guys baby seals out on the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that why you're here?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here for a multitude of reasons,
but one of them is just the natural beauty
[SPEAKER_06]: of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have that vista.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you were at Jacob and Nicole's wedding?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And lots of cannabis activists were there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there was a select group of cannabis
activists, including Matt and Sarah and
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've known them a long time and it's
great to see that they tied it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Amazing.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: After all these years, I look forward to
one day being official to re I eloped with
[SPEAKER_08]: my wife.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We eloped in Jamaica in 95.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to do it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I wanted to do it right before my
father passed away and that sort of put
[SPEAKER_08]: the kibosh on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a 10 year anniversary,
but maybe we could do a 20 year
[SPEAKER_08]: anniversary or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been with my wife for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been married now, whatever it is,
19.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was pretty big too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever he gives me big rips like that,
I'll just give him one back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my next one is a more reasonable
size.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not loading up anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to be nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I took mine with a grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got me ripped.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this was the, my little pony and
spit it at you though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you do, it'll be for the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being renamed to MLP.
[SPEAKER_08]: MLP sounds like a political person.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm past the point.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty close to MLP.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Major league baseball.
[SPEAKER_08]: Major league.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, MLP.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't even thinking that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ripper.
[SPEAKER_08]: That pure dry sift too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know it still makes it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I feel like I'm being suffocated
coughed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is more just like very expector
empty.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find the way you cough, you know,
I, I'm not really a big fan of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't cough, you don't get off
saying, I don't think that's true,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'll tell you the more you cough
sometimes, wow, the more you do get off.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was because you're choking yourself
with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_09]: So of course you're going to get a little
bit of a buzz from it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just my theory, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up pooch?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this one cat and dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, so much fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: My dog got shaved.
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes like a little deer now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a little deer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. C.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. C is in the house here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scratching me up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was thinking, I got, I got,
I got, um, I got like 280 grams of fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen Astro Boy in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got another like 70 grams of,
uh, nice dry popcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got another like quarter pound of nice
solid big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got another about 70,
80 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a smaller other popcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to run a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take 70 grams, crush it,
crush, get all this, get this,
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it, run the 70 grams of fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clean it or run it like a single bounce.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do a clean it, crush it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Completely see how much resin we get from
70 grams of dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then to how much grams we get from 280
grams of fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause then it gives us a ratio.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ratio should be accurate.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you dry, you can also do it this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dry the material that you use fresh
afterwards and you'll get the dry weight
[SPEAKER_08]: of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll tell you, cause this people are
always so confused.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like dry yields way better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's like, well, dude, of course it
does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a higher ratio of plant matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just common sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dry yields way better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it would be.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't yield any different.
[SPEAKER_08]: It yields the same yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: The yield is there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dry is not going to change it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I'm not looking at the,
actually I'm not looking at the yield that
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm more, I'm more curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more curious on the high.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not the ratio either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more curious on the facts.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, let's just take this whole.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you'll have a lack of terpenes in
the dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean that you won't have to be curious
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fact of science.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dry material or have less terpenes than
fresh material.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, dry trichome membranes are easier
to dry with water hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in a sense, in my opinion,
give like a nicer, fresh frozen is awesome
[SPEAKER_08]: for a short period, but then it butters
out hard and it's like, it's just so hard
[SPEAKER_08]: to dry that stuff properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be done, but here in the Northwest
Pacific Northwest, we should mention
[SPEAKER_08]: really that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the kick there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The humidity is high here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like really high.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's actually maybe even getting room.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more control.
[SPEAKER_08]: So high.
[SPEAKER_08]: It butters out Matt's dry sip.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, come on, look, this is it right
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be just powdered out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it takes the argument out of the white
out sort of all water hashes wet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Jen Doe on Facebook,
she's mentioning her theory is,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that it's natural plant acids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's natural plant acids,
if it's terpenes, there's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_08]: different solvents in the resin itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be breaking down the wax
membrane, but it seems to have something
[SPEAKER_08]: to do with moisture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm well baked here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually, you know, I just did a rip
of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that the Barb?
[SPEAKER_08]: Barb or blue?
Blue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue's Barb too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to give you one more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I just, I just, I just had this
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: You must've been puffing Barb with Matt
and Sarah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there was some Barb.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there was some Barb and some CBD
Renee.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you said smaller.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to go see those guys soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go film an episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't told.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure she says another epic adventure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It always is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love going to visit those guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Enjoy talking about, you know,
Matt's just so passionate about growing
[SPEAKER_12]: and about getting the proper medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really nice talking with him about
growing techniques and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_12]: because we need to sit down there and talk
with even someone like anybody who's
[SPEAKER_12]: breeding and growing at any kind of level
is doing it because they're passionate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like talking with you, Sarah, about how
you love growing and talking about the
[SPEAKER_10]: different times and temperatures and
humidities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of, it's kind of nice to be
able to sit down and talk to somebody
[SPEAKER_10]: who's spent years doing exactly what we
love doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, how many years have you been growing
for?
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven or eight, maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I guess it's maybe about eight now.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And why you're actually getting like a
vacation right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you shut your garden down?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm lucky that I have a partner,
boyfriend that's able to take care of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, so I'm lucky enough,
thank you, to be able to come out here and
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoy BC and see all my friends and go to
wedding and hopefully I'll come back again
[SPEAKER_06]: soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always used to come back like until I
moved here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came back once and then I came back like
twice and then I came back like three
[SPEAKER_08]: times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just like, oh, I'm coming here
quite often.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came here when I was three.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never went back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, your parents brought you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little harder when you just go by
yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: I came here when I was three, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I hitchhiked into BC when I was about 17.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had gone before with my grandma when I
was nine and seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were with your wife.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the first time I came here,
I hitchhiked by myself with my snowboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You determined.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like an adventure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was quite something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did Jasper and I did Lake Louise,
cruised through Banff, got all the way to
[SPEAKER_08]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: My last ride dropped me off and I thought
they were pretty cool people, but I left
[SPEAKER_08]: my backpack in there with all my like
these clothes I bought in Central America
[SPEAKER_08]: and like a CD player with like a,
you know, like a bunch of good CDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I never, they never came back.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were the ones that dropped me off.
[SPEAKER_08]: They knew the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a bummer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got pulled over in that same van in the
interior in Banff and we're like,
[SPEAKER_08]: way up in this mountain town and his whole
dashboard is full of, what did he have?
[SPEAKER_08]: He had like sugar cubes wrapped in tin
foil or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And each one had two hits of LSD in them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he had a giant ashtray on the dog
house, just full of roaches.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we got pulled over, me driving by the
RCMP.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and it wasn't insured.
[SPEAKER_08]: The vehicle wasn't insured.
[SPEAKER_08]: So think of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is this possible in any way?
[SPEAKER_08]: That you could get away from that
situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you imagine how impossible that
would be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't see the LSD.
[SPEAKER_08]: He seemingly ignores the joints.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't ask to search the van.
[SPEAKER_08]: He tells us that if we make a promise to
just pull up the street a bit here,
[SPEAKER_08]: he'll take us to a park and just sleep in
the van overnight and then walk down the
[SPEAKER_08]: hill and right at the bottom of the hill,
there's an insurance place and buying
[SPEAKER_08]: insurance for the van.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we did that, he'd be good with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Small towns.
[SPEAKER_08]: RCMP though, federal officer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could go either way, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, all I know is not all cops are
dicks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this guy certainly was not a dick.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Drove us up.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, all right guys, I'm trusting
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomorrow morning, I'll walk down and get
the insurance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, being the dumbest that we
were, we drove the van down the next day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still, still idiots.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's disrespectful kind of of the
situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, you kind of wanted to say,
okay, I'll take your deal and I'll go
[SPEAKER_06]: through with it to the letter.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to allow him to be a nice guy and
then not ruin that for everyone else by
[SPEAKER_08]: putting egg on his face and saying,
why do I, why did I trust you?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, we could have spent the
night in jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I can't remember what else I had,
but oh dude, listen for sure overnight in
[SPEAKER_08]: jail and holding that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you were certainly super lucky and
he was a great hit there.
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: John's just feeding us hits.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super high already.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just little micro dabs of killer
first mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're tasty as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the good shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's just first bounce.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even the first bounce or more
than anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really clean your hash much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_12]: I bring it to you now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't cleaned any of your hash in a
while.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be making bubble hash with
the fresh rules.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's going to be another, another week
and that goes so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get my first bounce and then I wash it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I'm, I'm in hash heaven.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you using the two 50 and the one 80?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you use those quite a bit?
[SPEAKER_09]: I do because that's the first bounce every
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's good with that was is the
leftovers that just kind of like I got the
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love my 70.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty much always out of 90 runs by
73 and then lately I've been mixing the 90
[SPEAKER_10]: and the 73 only on the second run because
that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I just, the first one is like the
first balance of the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's the second run,
which is, I gotta get more, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: so it's like, I got stages and,
and now with my hash fridge that I just
[SPEAKER_09]: picked up, I got three times the ice half
moon and I have that separate drawer so I
[SPEAKER_09]: can actually, you know, I have that
freezer full of weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I have a freezer full of weed right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have three My Little Ponies that filled
two half pound bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have three or four astro boys that
filled a couple of half pound bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just took one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just took five actually, but I literally
just took one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it big?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, nothing big.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reasonable or huge.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just reasonable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go with reasonable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a, I've had a lovely day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the boat ride for me and jumping in
and you might see me going hard and stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: like that, but actually I can say I told
Mark how stiff my neck was.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's flaking up now that I'm getting some
medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubbling it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the mother ship.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I also have a whack load of fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to, I'm not in a huge rush to
get it done because I have resin right
[SPEAKER_08]: now, but I'll definitely be doing it in
the next week.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do one for puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll even go get a 20 gallon machine
and some 20 gallon bags and we'll do a 20
[SPEAKER_08]: gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just literally like do all of my shit
at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do like a, just do a lucky day profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these like awesome strains that I
grew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything that's grown, it's all organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no worries that I know that all of
it will be full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't consider myself an expert brewer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I will tell you, the guy that
showed me and taught me how to grow Ron
[SPEAKER_08]: Hickey, that guy was a very good teacher.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was OCD to the T.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so focused and like interested in the
perspective of the plant and spend so much
[SPEAKER_08]: time amongst the plants and in the plant
that he was a good, he was a good mentor
[SPEAKER_08]: to have for having grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: A good teacher is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, remember our videos in the Jamaican
field, the blueberry skunk?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the orange hill blueberry skunk
from the field that John and I were in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saved one seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, this wasn't from the field we
were in.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one was from the nicest bud we saw at
Inn of the yard while we were in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember we got showed that really
nice bud that you and Tony smoked?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was pretty much the nicest bud we
saw while we were there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm definitely going to get a cutting
of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is the one you said didn't
have much of a smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have much of a smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like tomato-y.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of the average standard smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other Jamaican that I have has a
really nice stalk smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pointy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, really pointy.
[SPEAKER_08]: As will the sweet skunk and the congolese,
which is right behind you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just moved away from that and after
you put that plant over there and
[SPEAKER_12]: rummaging it, it smells really nice right
over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about that one?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Barb or Afghani?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's Afghan from the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always good to be surrounded by
interesting genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be interested to see what comes of
this particular strain that lived its life
[SPEAKER_08]: in Jamaica and is now here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a dedication, effort, learning,
sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants tell us a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that is the key.
[SPEAKER_08]: My son was moving one of my plants while I
was away and he snapped one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: branches and he just tied it up with a
rope and it doesn't even need the rope
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing is solid again.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you know that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Intuitive, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: He just got it right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so next generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hand down those skills.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's growing all the peppers here as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a whole row of sweet peppers
that we're growing and we planted the
[SPEAKER_08]: sunflowers together by in seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have hibiscus, sorrel going.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an avocado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put a potato that needs watering
desperately up in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's desperate.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need some water.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs some water.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a potato though.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll have water to feed those leaves for
so much longer than most of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those leaves are all coming out of the
potato.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're good solid greens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet I imagine that would impact your
potato production.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess we're ranting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to stay here and be
stoned.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll catch up with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're quite high and I have no idea what
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: We may see Sarah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did some dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm bringing over some food.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great BC day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this vacation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We may see Sarah again, but if not,
we thank you for coming out and we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe see you next time in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see Johnny and me on Puff
Wednesday in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try and film it and I'll try to get
it edited the same day and uploaded.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make it short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make it short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dee and I were driving through
Vancouver on our motorcycles and we bumped
[SPEAKER_08]: into Sarah and John.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, we should be eating at Joey's
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's Darren?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, there's Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I caught the UE in the middle of
Hastings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I could eat dinner after a good
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in reverse and backed it up on
the street if they were stuck in traffic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we figured we'd come into Stanley Park,
have a little sesh.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is generally a pretty popular spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it's so fucking windy that dabs
aren't going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we got the apex.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I figured you want to light that
up, Sarah?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apex down with some of D420K's full melt
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Full melt dry?
[SPEAKER_08]: Full melt dry sift in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows about the full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Respect, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said dab his head to the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come bubble dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is bubble man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just bumped into some dudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to come down and hit some
balls with this horn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know about dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we're filming.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you won't be on TV.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not looking to be on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't risk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be powered.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't risk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ball up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're here on vacation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're behind the scenes supporting you
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, we like the support from behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We like our hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's critical.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, let's just hit a few more Apex
bowls and we'll plug her off to a part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the park where we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I used to come here for the nine o
'clock bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at nine o'clock every night,
I can panic about what makes me bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not with back in the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is a classic spot that you can
come here at almost any time and catch
[SPEAKER_08]: people smoking herb here.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people come and smoke herb at the
lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's North Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: And behind us, and West Vancouver,
the rest of Stanley Park goes into the
[SPEAKER_08]: Lionsgate Bridge, which is one of two ways
to get into the north side of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the other one over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful ride through the park.
[SPEAKER_08]: Second narrows.
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing is hitting like a champ.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: This thing hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's called the seawall.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes around the entire park,
actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: The seawall is the most popular thing at
Insta.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stanley Park.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes the entire round the whole park.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 11 kilometers long.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take our bikes down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ride it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ride it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've done it on a bicycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do it on a skateboard and whatever
those shoes and wheels are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rollerblades.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you want to wear those.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a rollerblader.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell?
[SPEAKER_12]: Good time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember last time we were on the other
side of the bridge in West Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember we watched that cruise ship go
right on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That big ship.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't clear by very much either.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a couple feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're surprised.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about 20 or 30, but it's still
like... It looked like two feet from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you say, Dee?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do you want to go do dab to dry
sift?
[SPEAKER_08]: Wherever we can get away with it nicely
and easily.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anywhere we want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to do it in the park?
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere that's low wind over by a tree
or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can find a big hollow tree or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we're going to go figure out a
spot to dab up, finish off on the apex.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at Prospect Point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to go check out the view here from
Stanley Park across the water to West
[SPEAKER_08]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the guys are going to grab some
ice cream or some food here and see what
[SPEAKER_08]: happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go check out the view.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get me one.
What do you want?
[SPEAKER_08]: An ice cream?
[SPEAKER_08]: Vanilla?
[SPEAKER_08]: Helicopter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's quite a Canadian flag right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the Stanley Park Lions Gate view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright,
[SPEAKER_08]: well I think we're going to wait for the
ice cream delivery from Darren,
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah and John.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to head down to one of the lower
areas and have a dab session.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems a lot less windy over on this
side of the island, so we'll catch up with
[SPEAKER_08]: you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: West Coast ice cream session with John and
Sarah and soon to be D420K.
[SPEAKER_07]: Want some ice cream?
[SPEAKER_07]: I see one with your name on it right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm thinking we head up towards the
view, go down a few levels and just pull
[SPEAKER_08]: one of those spots as our own spot and dab
it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got the fatty going already.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dennis Hopper fatty.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're at Stanley Park.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the Lions Gate Bridge right next
to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually see Mount Baker.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty beautiful view today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we've got North and West
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all West Vancouver in behind us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's quite an entry port.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the ships that come from around the
world to bring things to Vancouver
[SPEAKER_08]: basically come right in through here.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the cruise ships come in and go out
through here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't really get out the other end.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Indian arm.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seals up in deep cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: D's joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: D's joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: D's joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell us a little bit about D's joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: D's joint, we had a shop going for seven,
eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut her down in 2008 due to a landlord.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to go in the bush and make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in PG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to open up another shop
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting married the other month and then
it's supposed to be head opening up a shop
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting it going again at the Seat
Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a tattoo studio in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a piercing studio in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be clothing lines that
you've never seen before that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be new and put out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk to a lot of personal
glassblowers that do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy stuff from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk to some of the
distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to do my thing like I like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real good social aspect of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings people together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do seminars on how to teach
people how to make the dry set,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to make the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just making it and figuring they're
making it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I show them the right way,
they will just go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do know the right way.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to seeing what you produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's many hats that you could wear up
there in regards to that store.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tattooing, distribution, potentially seeds
and maybe even eventually in the beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: world of B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe one day you'll be able to sell a
legal canvas up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it does become recreational legally
and all that sort of stuff, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the pain management.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were filming up with the planes behind
us that time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember we'd be like, no, no,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and tell people, no, no,
you can go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because quite a few people there were
actually included.
[SPEAKER_08]: They weren't wanting to cross the camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, these people didn't even have any
idea they were on camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on Buggleman's World.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm down with a dab here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put me a dab on the dabber and I'll heat
up my pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all you have to do is pick this dabber
up, put some hash in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll heat this up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to go with whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like all John's flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any dab will do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any dab will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any non-fire in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was so great about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen this before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the year on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably November.
[SPEAKER_02]: November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you already know that this has got
probably almost... Sorry, sir.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got nine months curing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine month cure hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take it.
That
[SPEAKER_03]: was like a rock.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what's best is as he's hitting
that, you're hitting this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to hit this here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really loving this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can load it up for you, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mind my reach.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got about three glass pipes here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Patrick Redbeard's Swiss Perk
Pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a piece from the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you've got the little piece that
Flav421 gave you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a Peter's size cross love.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got some air traffic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which song was playing last night?
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which song was playing last night?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I want it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were hitting this little pipe hard last
night at my place.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was quite nice and terrible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just bigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just beyond bigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I give you some 120?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone will take 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all about the flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: We always come equipped with B-Line.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very key actually, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if you're going to pull away from the
torch and the nail, to not have the B-Line
[SPEAKER_08]: for me is like these little skillet oil
slips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prince of Wales that boat that just went
by.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm definitely going to hook you up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm definitely going to hook you up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both those hits were great.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dab was obviously a little lighter and
a little cooler with more taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the B-Line rip, my God, it hits you to
the head.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the 120.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got my 90U shirt on today,
but I love my 120.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got my 73 and when he showed up last
night, he was wearing a 120.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey man, we're all about one thing and
that is that epic hash that we love to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty sure you guys like to smoke it too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why you're watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you most of the people watching
right now are smoking something of some
[SPEAKER_08]: sort while we're puffing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it would be weird just to watch us
puff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to puff with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't have anything to puff,
then it's not weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just be like inspired and realize
that you too can puff the best that there
[SPEAKER_08]: is by simply making different choices.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm going to grow this and I'm going
to extract this with care and attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, if you don't decide to do
those things, I have a funny feeling that
[SPEAKER_08]: enough people are going to invest their
time in the near future to get it done so
[SPEAKER_08]: that people on all levels have access to
it, whether you grow and isolate and
[SPEAKER_08]: extract hash or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a nice one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rocker.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was the fresh frozen of the MKU that
I cooked down before we went for our first
[SPEAKER_01]: trip to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you went back again and now we're
finishing it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a fun trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met some good folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll meet them next time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was hoping it was for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm next after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just all hardcore, push Sarah down and
take the rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: She gets up, roundhouses me on the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a ripper.
[SPEAKER_08]: John's trying to kill Sarah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, I got in trouble for that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cut.
Cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's no water in the pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't go up and get the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck are we doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be right back with all taken care of
Sarah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking care of Sarah.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's doing good.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's starting to recover now already.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take one for the team.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be sitting next to her with my eyes
watering.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like crying.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting some water.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got the one we're all looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got the teary eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim Horton's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crucial for the Kimmies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might spontaneously start
coughing again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was good, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Extremely high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: The MK Ultras, real nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fresh, frozen goodness right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have about 800 people taking pictures
of us right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's pretty hilarious.
[SPEAKER_08]: At first they were taking pictures of the
view, but now they're like, those people
[SPEAKER_08]: down there are smoking bongos.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole bunch of children.
[SPEAKER_05]: The kids are busy looking at the flag.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we came all the way down here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good not to drive after you puff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been here 20 years and never in my
life come to this spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think John's been here 40 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've never come.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never been here.
[SPEAKER_08]: 40 years living in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then drove up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy beautiful BC days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're definitely a Whistler fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you cross this bridge and you literally
take a 15-minute ride around that mountain
[SPEAKER_08]: right there, from that point on,
it's one hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take the gondola up to the top of
the mountain and literally walk around the
[SPEAKER_08]: peak.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm telling you, nothing else you do
here will move you that much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even people that aren't into mountains go
up there and they've got a tear in their
[SPEAKER_08]: eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's Cross Mountain?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cross Mountain is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have an amazing experience up
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right where the big band tower is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one with the wind turbine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to the left of the windmill,
you can see a building in the trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And do you have a car?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should look at driving up into,
not maybe Horseshoe Bay, but White Cliff
[SPEAKER_08]: Park is at Horseshoe Bay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Lighthouse Park is in West
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually close to where those ships
are.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: The trails through that park and how they
all come out at the ocean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be standing there and watching a
crowd of dolphins swim by.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lighthouse Park is the one I always went
to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the epic, huge, giant trees in
the park.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very old.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a nice hike to come up a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calco Lano Suspension Bridge is good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say go to Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lynn Canyon is the smaller, less touristy
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's the better one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because everything, the location,
the suspension bridge, the view of the
[SPEAKER_08]: suspension bridge from Lynn Canyon is more
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's less built up and less people go
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot more narrow too, so it's really
cool to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool that you know most of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been here 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I missed all of this stuff
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see all of that and I'm leaving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you'll come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time I want to go see some of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you're on Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're filming this right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're all like the most
cannabis-based people you could possibly
[SPEAKER_08]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all work exclusively in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: She grows cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I teach people how to make hash for the
last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys have shops and products and
also promote growing in hash and we're all
[SPEAKER_08]: medical, federally medical patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's helped tons of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Cali speeds up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like Colorado left California in
the dust and California forever was the
[SPEAKER_08]: most progressive, the most on point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't get the vote.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seemed insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did California not get the vote?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_08]: enjoy your trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on a different level too though.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all have different state rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it needs to be flipped to
federal because you have right now
[SPEAKER_08]: families with epileptic children who are
like, I live in Utah, I can't get the
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine and it will stop my child from
having seizures every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they move, they drive to states
where they're allowed to have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of country is that making
fucking people move over to another state?
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole, I mean, the recreational use,
I mean, I can see people debating it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Debate it all day long.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The minute you let medicinal in the door
and you realize just how medicinal it is
[SPEAKER_08]: and everyone's like, it's the most
medicinal thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so medicinal.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually take it just for its
euphoric after effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now, now wreckable it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Post-traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is one of the most effective drugs that
they know of.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course it's not even recognized by
doctors.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't describe it to soldiers.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all just crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, man, like from up here,
I think like it's the land of the free.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's America.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, we're fighting for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, how do you do that to your
people?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's not, you know, it's,
we have federal licensing, so you can get
[SPEAKER_08]: a license here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's like, it's a special license that
you go and get from your doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally accepted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Vapor bars, dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you go into those stores,
they'll give you a card pretty darn fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not too much different from the
California model.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a model that is okay for
beginners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And eventually once we get into something
more established, you know, maybe let that
[SPEAKER_08]: small amount be grandfathered in or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you always need like, we'll always
need dispensaries and vapor lounge type
[SPEAKER_08]: bars, regardless of how the cannabis goes
to a more pharmaceutical bar.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds insane, but if you learn that
you have an endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_08]: that every cell in your body has receptors
for this particular type of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_08]: which are produced androgynously in your
body are called endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how they're produced, they use the
building blocks of omega threes and omega
[SPEAKER_08]: sixes, essential fatty acids, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your doctor says, she's making me laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we can get into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's a master regulator to the central
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got my mom up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually ran out of fucking gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here?
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a rental car.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the space spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just called them up and get them to
bring some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triple A is coming.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was good chatting with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check out bubble man's world on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to come back here that I take
it, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we always ready.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's the best part about what we
do is while we're sitting here and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking and someone drives interest,
we just educate and then who's now going
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about it with more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave it on that note.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Sarah, it was super awesome hanging
with you and puffing with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you back in Toronto,
if not back in BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B tomorrow, Puff Wednesday and
D420.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you're in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're doing Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did a show on his channel too today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that will be on D420K on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep that out too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.
