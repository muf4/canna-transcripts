[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still Sunday at about almost 420,
10 minutes till 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make sure that we have a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I'll make sure we have a hit
with what we're about to do, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: process a little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Hash Church today, we had Soyl Grown
from Instagram come in and talk a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about his bud tech of pressing buds in
the t-shirt press, which he does for less
[SPEAKER_01]: than a few seconds at a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was around 300 or 280.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, the hair straightener guys,
I think they were talking about 200 to 230
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tool that I actually have today is one
of these small hair straighteners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess I could have had that plugged in
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real nice easy switch on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn on and off and we'll get to that in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, this is the process of
milking the resin glands from the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter or from the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not done it with plant matter yet,
but I did do one little batch using some
[SPEAKER_01]: lower quality dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured because I know that works for
sure, I'm going to start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got my pressing screen from a 25
micron pressing screen from a bubble bag
[SPEAKER_01]: kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of parchment paper
left over from when D420K gave me a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the straightener and then
I've also actually got some slick sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we would do a little bit through
the parchment paper and a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: through the slick sheet and then we could
kind of see which one we liked more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, most people are using the
parchment paper without even the 25 micron
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you find when you use the hash
method, when you're using hash instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: bud that it is actually quite convenient
to use it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just cut off a little a little
square.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some sort of like much hotter
temperatures can be can be used on this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to get just the tiniest little
bit of rosin on my finger and now I can
[SPEAKER_01]: feel it literally on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be careful with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so what we're going to do is
we're going to take a little bit of this
[SPEAKER_01]: no melt sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of see the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I purified it, but it's not it's just not
melty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not happening on the melt
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I changed the color of the
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a little blue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm okay with it if you guys are
okay with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so what we're going to do is we're
going to get this hash rolled into a
[SPEAKER_01]: little sort of section of the pressing
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what Jeff was showing us today on
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: He twisted it up kind of got it all
twisted up like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then he nearly took it and
he placed it between the pressing screen
[SPEAKER_01]: between the parchment paper, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's just a matter of turning this
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff had a digital readout on his.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the lowest temperature he could
turn this on to was about 230 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of test test it with my finger
and you can kind of see right off the bat
[SPEAKER_01]: as you start pressing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of start seeing resin leak out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it already starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, a little bit more,
a little bit more pressure, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can really see it kind of greasing
up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so turn that little guy off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw that took a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can open that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your pressed hash inside the
pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of course still has some goods on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then most importantly, you've got the
dabs that you just got out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How impressive is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let me pick that up because you
guys need to see a little bit better than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I just pressed that right
out of right out of that hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw it right here on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure before you saw it on Bubble
Man's World, if you're out there at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you saw Soil Grown, you saw Jeff Church,
and you saw these couple of other
[SPEAKER_01]: characters that are out there doing these
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I by no means am claiming that I am the
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just find it very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty cool that we can get
this quality of resin out of a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: grade, lower quality of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can open that up and you can see on the
inside what we're left with is that lower
[SPEAKER_01]: grade of hash that we've melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that was step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why don't we try doing that again
with that same little bit of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll wrap it in the other paper this
time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see what we can get off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if maybe there's more of an
attractant to this particular type of
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Teflon type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oil is just from one little mild
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see the oil is wanting to come
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I can see them dripping actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Milked off on that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like the way it looks on this
paper even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks as though even though the same
amount of heat was applied, I didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: the same amount of bubbles on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind this is an older hash and
I think the reason we're A, seeing this
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness is because A, I'm new at this and
I'm probably using more heat than I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also that this material is a little
bit older.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been dried for an extremely long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to photograph both the
parchment as well as the, let's get the
[SPEAKER_01]: name right here, the oil slick sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call it the slick sheet
because that's what they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the slick sheet also has some nice
material here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will photograph that for you guys as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll put that off to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that is pretty darn cool right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of rosin for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you guys have anything you want to
add to the comments, please do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the video here,
and of course if you haven't subscribed
[SPEAKER_01]: already, please subscribe and of course
share these videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get them out to as many
people as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having an audience as big as the one I
have right now is a huge blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank all of you guys for
spending your time watching these shows
[SPEAKER_01]: and spending your time commenting and
trying to make the channel a better
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rosin tech from the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
See you next time.
