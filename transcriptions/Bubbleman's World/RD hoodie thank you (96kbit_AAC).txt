[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to open up a package I got
today in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take a few dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this came today from the Rare Dankness
Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty stoked, because I've been speaking
with Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty darn sure I know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm stoked!
[SPEAKER_00]: Skeletools, not just for taking dabs,
but also for opening packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we'll put that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really, really a nice looking
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: XL, I was worried it was going to be a
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice looking hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to get down and represent!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels like just yesterday I was looking at
one of my friends wearing one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: sick hoodies on the Facebook page there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: To wear the Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely was stoked on puffing your
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely was stoked on puffing that
moonshine haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess recently you did a new cross,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You did another cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading about it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, what was it, the C99 crossed
with the moonshine haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I'm always looking forward to
trying more of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank his wife, the whole Rare Dankness
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, check out Rare Dankness for some
serious genetics, some serious resin
[SPEAKER_00]: producing full melt certified strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, maybe we better take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't just end it with just me yapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little full melt dry sift here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denailing the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Rare Dankness.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
