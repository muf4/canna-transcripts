[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here at my warehouse slash office
space slash storefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the different bubble bags
lined up in the back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of Jason King posters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I wanted to actually just show
you one of my prized possessions in my
[SPEAKER_00]: glass collection, which is one of my
Marcel Bronze from 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the original sculptured
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the incredible octopus on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful school of physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a fish with an angel fish that's
hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually fill him and the octopus
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course it's got the Marcel 99
signed marble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's been a while since I hit this old
school can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I think it's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dump in a little bubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got myself a little screen on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of Astro Boy bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full melt for the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got myself a beeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barely lift the beeline, but I got it
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time to hit some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
