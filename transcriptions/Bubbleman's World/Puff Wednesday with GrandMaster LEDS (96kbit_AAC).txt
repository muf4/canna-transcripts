[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome Thomas, my new colleague and
business partner- colleague at Grandmaster
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys saw the recent video on
Grandmaster LEDs, Grandmaster Level
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as BC Bubble Man's, Bubble Man's
World channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a big video announcing that I'm now
working with Grandmaster LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been working with Thomas for
some months now, kind of in the back end
[SPEAKER_02]: of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is now us putting the tarantula board
lights that he has brought to with him
[SPEAKER_02]: into these two 5x5 tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our pumps, we've got our
reservoir off camera, and we've got our
[SPEAKER_02]: tent expert Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't been here before,
you've seen Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: and I build and put tents together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to blast these out,
I guess, here in the next half an hour to
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited to mount those lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited for the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: brought his light meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to talk about light recipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can test some stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this is what's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really seeing new technologies come
to market and see more.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we got ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it right on top of that box.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my understanding, this goes in at
last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny, stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you weren't doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing everything, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did you have some dabs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, what's nice about doing tents
and doing this for so long, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: quite easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with the base guys,
and really just quick and simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is about locking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always have them to the inside so that way
you don't get kicked or pushed on the
[SPEAKER_03]: inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always make sure they go on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I guess I've done this
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you've done it a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there one other tall one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this it right here?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm looking here, so I'm seeing some
bottoms here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this here's got a bottom and a bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look right to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them are ones and two of them are
twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the ones and the twos exactly the
same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at here on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: These should have to be the ones in
between, no?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those ones are going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacked too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what got me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, on the bottom here, John,
we need to have the two opposing or ones
[SPEAKER_02]: and the two opposing or twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why they have it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that one is a two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a one?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a one there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a two here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well that's a two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this one, which I'm almost
certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a one or a two?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost certain it's a one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just replace it with this two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it means nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just try to follow the simple rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow the rules?
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes up the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: See on the bottom?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no three and a three and a
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, here's a four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need fours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four first.
[SPEAKER_02]: This must be funny to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, we haven't built a tent
in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, there's a one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're going to need to do our ones
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so which ones are our ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a one will go here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this will all come together,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the magic right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, I think, if you just hold that
for a second, goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally gets confusing coming on this last
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't even get to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's tripped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're watching a little bit of the
madness that's going on in my dirty ass
[SPEAKER_02]: garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you flip that back to screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now these are top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got two and one big one right
across the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funnest part is actually putting the
tent over this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the one that goes right across.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the bottom right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's what we need to slide over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's a T.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want the T, just one half of the
T, to go right like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to go underneath it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Donk.
Pull it back on that side, Johnny.
You got to
[SPEAKER_02]: lift that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's realizing we need a tray for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the T?
[SPEAKER_03]: You go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, you need to hurry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to flip it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will tighten around.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, pull this back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about the poles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about the poles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about the poles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bottom zipper we're going to
have to deal with too, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm stuck in here!
[SPEAKER_02]: I just choked you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny Zipped me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we sit him up in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you find him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see where we can get him out of
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd he go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, open the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tried my side?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get him in there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a window in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're weird?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a black box.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: There I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the air?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
I was in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so shall we bust another tent,
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bust another tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bust another tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the scissors at?
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing, the reason why I mentioned
the other thing is it's nice to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: hard tray that you can screw in a hose
that then leads to something like a pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have one end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only need to put that on one end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to be on the right one so it
won't line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one can go right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of knowing whether you
did it right or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's easier that you don't have to
risk anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the learning lesson number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the best part of both is that we open
this tent up properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make this so you can open up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do the shit we just did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make sure we do it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what I was hoping.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we could just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We totally butchered it last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we totally butchered it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't have gotten like 10 tents in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be, this is the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a T, remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom's actually in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the, yeah, the bottom is in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the bottom is where it,
go that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the T,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we got to open this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting this boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're really doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have fun while building some Lego
tents with your buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are fun, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to slow down, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep it simple.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: would you look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we just walk this around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on over here,
[SPEAKER_03]: take a bow, guys.
Everybody.
Mark.
Thomas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, come on over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a second, I'm going to finish this up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a bow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get that light out.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's all about this light.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to the tents and the pumps and
the this's and the that's and the
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoir, but this light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's upside down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprised that we made it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to flip this tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to really flip the tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's totally upside down?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the matter if we flip it upside
down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a hole on, there's a vent on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, they put them on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we just flip it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just flip it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's flip it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's done pretty sunny.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They missed the flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now we get this ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: This right here is what brought Thomas and
I together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Durantula Borg.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Durantula Borg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you start talking a little
bit about this beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the world's most diverse,
sophisticated light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a four channel light that has the
ability to do any spectrum that any
[SPEAKER_04]: company has ever made before and spectrums
that no one has ever made.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can go bluer or redder than any light
has ever had the ability to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also is the very first LED light
that can do an HPS spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's so sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this 54, 56?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 5,600.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see what the diodes on the
cool channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got EVO Mint diodes with EVO 301H
diodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what allows us to achieve a
double blue wavelength with a 437
[SPEAKER_04]: nanometer and 450.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is our warm white channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 2,200 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have 660 nanometer and 730
nanometer diodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature range of this light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1,800 Kelvin to 9,000 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can make special units for our R&D
or on request that go up to 12,000 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why we don't have it 1,800 to
12,000 Kelvin is because you would be
[SPEAKER_04]: using one driver way more than the other
and trying to have as much balance as
[SPEAKER_04]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot that we can do with this
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many preset spectrums?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 60 to choose from, but there's
hundreds that we can actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's really cool about our
controller that just finished this week,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can literally do multiple spectrums
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can start the day off with our base
spectrum and then six hours in,
[SPEAKER_04]: switch it to blue for an hour,
then go to red for an hour, then back to
[SPEAKER_04]: our base spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can have 730 nanometer on
until like after the lights go out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 730 nanometer is in HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in most LED lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use it to put the plants to sleep
after the lights go out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally it takes two hours for your
plants to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: This does it in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This allows you to finish your crops three
to seven days faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've even seen someone recently named
Mitten Master who finished a crop two
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm testing these things out.
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 days, which is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big deal for a commercial outfit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge when it comes down to power
consumption, efficiency, everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: drawing time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see he's smiling as he was talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course I'm smiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over there on camera, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, you guys have a little conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny's got a lot more knowledge when it
comes to the lighting than I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing you're looking at is that
you're smiling and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking about what you love about
the lighting, what you talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the multiple spectrum that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And controlling those spectrums and being
able to take in like... Now think of the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think it's a hundred years and you'll be
able to grow cannabis, cucumbers,
[SPEAKER_03]: peppers, and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this light's able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can grow all different types of
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can lead R&D if you're trying to test
what spectrums are the absolute best to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's universities that are going to be
using this across the world to be testing
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk a little bit about the
efficiency of the light and how it plays
[SPEAKER_02]: into rebates in North America?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For efficiency, it doesn't have to be the
most efficient to qualify for a rebate,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's got to be over 2.1 micromoles per
joule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why this is so important is the
efficiency, the efficacy of this light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting the most amount of light
per watt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say for example, we could put in any
company spectrum except for this light's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to put out more light per watt.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were designing this light,
we've changed the design three different
[SPEAKER_04]: times actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing took over a year to actually
develop with us constantly changing it or
[SPEAKER_04]: running into different obstacles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually started with four different
driver boxes because it's a four channel
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just realized it was creating too many
connections for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were just so many different things
that we changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I'm excited, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get this thing turned on.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about this ballast?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our driver box.
[SPEAKER_04]: We designed it like this so if there's
ever an issue, we can just swap that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where you're talking about the
drivers that are in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got four different drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use Ipentronics, which is the world's
best drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't cut any corners.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have the infrastructure to be able
to run these because it's possible to go
[SPEAKER_04]: up to 1,500 watts even though it's
designed to run at 700 watts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do need a bigger infrastructure to run
these, but the diversity and the
[SPEAKER_04]: competitive edge that you have is just
endless.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one option of being able to go a
driver set that does 120 to 277 volt,
[SPEAKER_04]: that auto converts, and then we also have
277 to 480 volt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do any plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make it compatible with any
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't someone ask us for 347 recently?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did that mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, 90% of actually large facilities are
on high voltage and they're using the 347.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't personally like messing with it
myself if I could avoid it because we get
[SPEAKER_04]: high voltage.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get a shock, it's high power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's high power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can really hurt, but what an efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more direct power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more efficient, but you also are
freeing up more amperage.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the big thing about high voltage.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm going from 120, a regular plug,
to 240, I'm freeing up double the amperage
[SPEAKER_04]: in my panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we get into amperage, we talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we used to run old HPS bulbs and
stuff, we had so many amps we were using
[SPEAKER_03]: for startups.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to turn different lights on
because we blow fuse boxes all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be roughly on, sorry,
I'm just trying to think on one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be about 6.8 amps if it was
running at full power, but you never would
[SPEAKER_04]: run it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's running at 240.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to roughly run about three and
a half amps if you're running it at 240.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you daisy chain these up and control
them with one single controller?
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely can daisy chain them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an RJ45 port so that they
connect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually just developed a new cord
so that you can actually daisy chain the
[SPEAKER_04]: lights together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one option right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are RJ45.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's kind of cool is about with any of
our existing lights, they have an RJ14
[SPEAKER_04]: port.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were designing our controller,
we wanted anybody- Is it going to hook up
[SPEAKER_04]: to a Trollmaster?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is compatible with a Trollmaster if you
want, but it's also, we designed it so
[SPEAKER_04]: that our controller can be used with any
existing lights that we've ever sold and
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've basically made it so it can be
compatible with any other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, what is your deal trying to make
shit compatible?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how the world works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's supposed to be incompatible,
so it drives you- No, it's kind of like an
[SPEAKER_03]: app where you can only buy Apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you can have things that work
with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, listen, that's a nice vibe right off
the bat because it sort of shows like,
[SPEAKER_02]: look, let's just create compatibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to need to figure out what we
need to get to hang that light because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sure there's something we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn it off for a second,
but we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, just put it in some ratchets
here real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: This all comes with the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the other one set up for the
other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's just a matter of putting the
other one on the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes like a single person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see this thing light up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get some cannabis plants in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully next week we can get that
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, trust me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be waiting much longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some seeds for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Lifecycle Botanics is going to
have some cuts ready for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe get some dead baba in here for the
first run.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went over to the facility guys and
checked out that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome what they're doing at
Lifecycle Botanicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to come over here,
Johnny, and you can line this one up?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put this one in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to go right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's just on myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much easier doing it with two
people, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I definitely like his style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could easily do that by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you just bring it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, we're going to have to get the
driver in first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you going to put the driver?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up top?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can get it higher without the
driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just send you an extension.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to just turn it on though.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just get it mounted like this just
to get it fired out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, you could put the driver on the
roof of the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some decent coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of craziest looking tent
LED light I've ever seen, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we actually have a light that's
designed for a tent called the Tarantula
[SPEAKER_04]: Tent Ultimate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 56 by 56 inches that goes into the
very far corners that has a special diode
[SPEAKER_04]: configuration to have the most uniform,
or the best uniformity that the world's
[SPEAKER_04]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is more for Marcus to kind of
play with spectrum tuning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I'm looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking to manipulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what I can find in the world of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you want to manipulate it to have it
ooze more resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without question, this is going to be
the best option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm doing actually even at my own
place right now is I swept out like four
[SPEAKER_03]: different lights talking about exactly
what you're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: By seeing those light spectrums and how
we're doing this exactly what the future
[SPEAKER_03]: is being.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you create your own spectrum and
take a look at how it's going to be used
[SPEAKER_03]: for resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get an extension cord and plug
this in just to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to take a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, might as well just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B's alarm just went off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to, but we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm in, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get going, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B, face the camera over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to get Johnny on the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's push ups time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: 20?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it's called a cat on a drip,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, push ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's using good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's awesome?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do 10, 20, 30, 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to keep up with Mark here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just building his shit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't do a real push ups and your nose
touches the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen that nose touch the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still did 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get your nose to touch the
ground when you've got a hat on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got a problem with my shoulder that I
just died.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know I had an issue with my
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need three in each one?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one in the middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get that one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_04]: You need one?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just got you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just cleaning this side.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you just have to move apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a move, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost fell right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing I could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the tent caught you.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now wait, where is the fog now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the what?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the plug down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the plug's right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the plug?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't want to plug that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to have to get an
extension cord.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to locate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting this done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we hang it with the other cords
first?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Borg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes through and shows there's pages
and pages and pages of light frequency
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this is the double blue he was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about the far red, 730 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole shit ton of presets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whole shit ton of presets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I've never been more stoked to
light up a light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we got this light and driver
mounted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly all done on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just need four people to lift it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we needed was four people to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or three disabled people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the fourth person?
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're two people, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we're going to need another plug
for the.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what do you got there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can control them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can first start by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Controlling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the 9000K channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy, insanely blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bluer than any light has ever been able to
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a commercial fixture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is the warm white channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the warm white?
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks very similar to what HPS is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for HPS also has a 730 nanometer in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now this is our 660 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really hard on the eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without glasses, it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's really blinding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God, it is terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B's got his light meter out and
he's doing some measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: All red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's 419.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one minute warning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an all red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you guys go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take a look what's going on here
and what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll add the far red to that actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll show the far red now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to redo it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see you added the 730.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you dump that in there so you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have fun here, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's add the warm white to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, this is the.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like warm white because that was
so red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says command has been finished yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you can see they're coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't it really show up on my camera?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that more doesn't come up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what's on right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it one more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hold it at different angles,
will it change?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you have there right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't want to show up on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's see what happens if you put it
all on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at all the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish that I could see it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weird now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have to zoom in so far to see the
light meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that double blue, far red,
big green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we could have a lot of fun
with this, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really manipulating all different light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what we're really seeing here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you can see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just all red.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, this is just the far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doing that on the fly, now give me
some all blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: 731 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now I'm going to go check out
over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: See it?
[SPEAKER_03]: See the spike of blue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that's going to be good for
pretending we have no spacing and what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot so we can talk about all
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we would have had light like
this back when we were trying to use all
[SPEAKER_03]: these and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were growing in a two-foot,
three-foot area, so you had to get
[SPEAKER_03]: certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use light to manipulate plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's so beautiful about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm just so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just how much things have evolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just imagine for the first 20
years of my growing, if you have an issue,
[SPEAKER_04]: you walk, you open the door and you're hit
with a heat wave because you didn't know
[SPEAKER_04]: you had a failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all blue with tiny bit of red.
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding you can have so much fun
and look at plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you start understanding what the
different spectrums have to offer,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the all red and the blue,
then it's an endless amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: We literally have years to just test of R
&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you testing for how well it grows
the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you testing how well it grows resin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about your fruit and vegetables?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you testing to keep your plants
shorter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you trying to make your plants
shorter?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much a red.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually stretch it with far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can elongate them, create leaf
expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting because when I was in
Mexico, I took my light meter all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, 17, all different cool spectrums
and understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Borg Tarantula.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate what's going on here
and just the technology and what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get that second one hung,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe how good it looks,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully have this thing up and running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within a week or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm going to be absolutely on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be pushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, final tent lit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's so bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the shades on your head,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know where they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: You had yours on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine are yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's two extra pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's two pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's wearing one and you're wearing one.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's a third pair.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's two pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only two.
[SPEAKER_02]: One came with each light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I brought a pair too, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a pair on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You took yours off.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, you know, just Jerry rigged
for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get this light set up
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually all the extension cords,
all of this stuff will be kind of out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is just the beginning of getting
a couple of five by five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have enough extension cords.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why this one is dark while this
one's light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we lit them both up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: The drivers are working on both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can mask in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to get some cannabis plants in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the very near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm just going to play around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to play around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: These tents are circled up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have these clips that you can clip on
for hooking up to tents.
[SPEAKER_04]: First time I ever saw them recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just have everything grow right
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to have it running with a grow
link sensor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like everything is completely automatic
and we're going to be having them as a
[SPEAKER_04]: guest to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can't represent what it can really
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they've got incorporated AI into
their system and thought of every last
[SPEAKER_04]: possible thing that it could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen guys, we're going to write,
say say sayonara here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace to Johnny B who brought his light
meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thomas from grand master LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to like, there you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out buddy and help them
put this all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm well, I'm bubble man and stay
tuned to bubble man's world because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be showing the weekly progress
with these lights, the different
[SPEAKER_02]: frequencies that we're going to use right
down to the resin coming out of the bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: bags and the dry sift screens and hope to
see you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep pushing.
