[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, welcome to Bowman's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting here with D420K in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the first time you see him
because we filmed all fucking day
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made like a two hour video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course now it's going to take me
hours to edit and fucking cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was saying let's get wake and baked
and I thought let's share it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll share it with the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all sitting down low so you might
want to pull that off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you a nice little influx of
glandular trichome heads for the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, waking bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Puff Wednesday today we're going to
hook up with Johnny Burfellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to potentially get out on the
boat because we did the Harleys yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we're not going to Harley ride
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going out for a little
boot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might not take you with us the whole
way with all the GoPro footage but we did
[SPEAKER_00]: that yesterday and we hope that you
enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That video should go up in the next few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that a fucking nice run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All around nice experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good feet at the midway point for lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a perspective of someone that rides a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty epic fucking highway to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyday you could leave this place and go
into Van or up to Whistler on this
[SPEAKER_01]: highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how a guy could ever have a
bad day riding on a road like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shannon Falls was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standing underneath those waterfalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: My back to it and the water coming down
from all that way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a burst of energy I got from Mother
Nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some humbling shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good hike up to the base of the falls too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, that's the shit that you do
with troubled youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the shit I did when I was
actually 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them up cruising up to the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went boulder hopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know boulder hopping, it has that
danger that a young 14, 15 year old boy is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't care about that part of the
danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I mean, it's the kind of
danger that it doesn't hit back as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a mistake, you slip, you smack
your head on a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite the same as playing around
with guns or doing the things that the
[SPEAKER_00]: troubled youth are getting into these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely saw that as a really good
potential for kids that are... One thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the troubled youth that I had
experience with is the youth these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do things out of fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stabbing, shooting, whatever, because they
don't want to just own up to their problem
[SPEAKER_01]: or face the problem they had, they created
or even have one put in front of them that
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple wrestling match, fist fight,
whatever, usually always solved it when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what always solved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were buddies afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my best friends that I had when I
was a little kid were my best friends
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up having little scraps when we
were young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't fight much, but I watched that
happen many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy scrap and then their buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drinking beer together, still bleeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy was just bouncing his head off
the ice block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point really is any of the youth out
there today, the guns, the knives,
[SPEAKER_01]: a black guy heals up, a fat lip stitches
up, everything's good, your knuckles heal
[SPEAKER_01]: up, and everybody goes home to their
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carry on, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you like the wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be filming all day with
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff Wednesday, so stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
