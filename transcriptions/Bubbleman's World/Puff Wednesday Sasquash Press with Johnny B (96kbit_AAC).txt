[SPEAKER_11]: Hey everybody welcome to bubble man's
world Johnny fucking be in the house and
[SPEAKER_11]: Bubble fucking man.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, bubble fucking man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that how we started this apologize for
the swearing we didn't those that may be
[SPEAKER_11]: watching with children We do apologize for
all 18 show by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not always plus 18 plus 19 plus 18
like cannabis Taskforce I'm just saying
[SPEAKER_11]: just anyway, so Johnny Johnny B came by
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna do a quick Sasquatch press We
found our last Sasquatch video was well
[SPEAKER_11]: received.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think 25 Thousand people have watched it
so far 26.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just from a month ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we figured why don't we do that again?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, you know like we look like we we
have the bun which we have Johnny brought
[SPEAKER_11]: the death baba.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to even pull a bud out and
show the camera up close I can do that
[SPEAKER_11]: actually beautiful little little death
baba very dense dense nugget and Pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty pretty nice nose on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I gotta say it's got a really nice
bouquet Massive well, we can show them on
[SPEAKER_11]: the video if you guys want to see the
difference one side You've got the gavitas
[SPEAKER_11]: on the other side.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the thousand watt regular Phillip
bulbs HPS HPS is and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: substantial the difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's definitely a lot more growth I'd
say like 20 to 30 percent more growth on
[SPEAKER_08]: the healthier.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can definitely see a difference Yeah,
and it comes from a lot of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_08]: we talked about And the videos that we've
done with the lighting and stuff like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now people are actually like hey come
check this out We see what you're doing
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no doubt about it He was all about
the Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he pressed or he trim some of that
death baba over the trim bin I wished I
[SPEAKER_11]: left it in a pile for you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't photograph the I'm maybe I did I
don't think I did though for some reason I
[SPEAKER_11]: got to cleaning it I separated it out into
a few piles here We have four piles on
[SPEAKER_11]: this piece of paper one, which is pure
contaminant I'll show you on the screen
[SPEAKER_11]: right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see there's Fibers and hairs in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's pieces of plant matter and things
that are not even really I don't even know
[SPEAKER_11]: what they are And there are some little
heads in there as well as capitate stocks
[SPEAKER_11]: and systolic hairs and then in the other
two piles basically you have one pile with
[SPEAKER_11]: a higher concentration of heads and
another pile with maybe a higher
[SPEAKER_11]: concentration of Pistol it hairs and
capitate stocks and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Johnny's idea was to Rosin Sasquatch
press the the whole lot Of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: My idea was like hey, let's separate it
out into a few different piles and we'll
[SPEAKER_11]: press that So I guess we have two good
piles here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't be the difference in the color
and stuff like that So this is a really
[SPEAKER_08]: good take a look at it It's like using the
110 and the 200 the 304 screens that we
[SPEAKER_11]: have in the dry You guys can kind of see
the two big piles here So this is what I
[SPEAKER_11]: think is the better of the two even though
this is lighter We'll see what the squish
[SPEAKER_11]: gives us.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be interesting to say the
least.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's gonna be tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, just saying that's what you guys
want do you See this is how we know we've
[SPEAKER_11]: got some good resin When the dress that
picks up in one single pile like that,
[SPEAKER_11]: that's that's something that's a thumbs up
So definitely and take a look at how this
[SPEAKER_08]: is actually like I said, it's and then
squishing the bud, too So we got different
[SPEAKER_08]: piles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like which ones have different
Ethnicities and what has got you know more
[SPEAKER_08]: more of a stone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've ever really thought of all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll just use this little bag here to
sort of Get the last little bit on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people don't like us touching our
resins Not wearing plastic rubber gloves
[SPEAKER_08]: or anything right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's just a real chill.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Christmas resin personal Christmas
resin stash so there's that one if you
[SPEAKER_11]: want to kind of maybe break it down and
You know get the pieces to fall down and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll fill these Now that is definitely a
lot different from when I first showed up
[SPEAKER_08]: with it I actually took a picture of it in
my hand when I left there and sent you a
[SPEAKER_08]: picture of the gum on my way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh good I'm not sure so that when I just
saw the funny picture of you showing up at
[SPEAKER_08]: my door Wow, this this went into a really
nice little this is like it's hardy,
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hardy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like it's a solid, you know,
there's
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you could just take out this chunk
right now as in one Wow Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that like so, you know what just a
little Just went like red and how that was
[SPEAKER_08]: squish up really hard too.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's much much lighter Yeah,
much much lighter just like I would have
[SPEAKER_11]: assumed like a talcum powder light,
you know not I'm guessing it was 20 20 to
[SPEAKER_11]: 30 percent So why don't we why don't we
pull out the little scale?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have a bunch of them here they're
about point eight to a gram Range we're
[SPEAKER_11]: not gonna have the most accurate numbers
here because we don't have a point zero
[SPEAKER_11]: zero scale But yeah, this is about point
eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can tear it actually That's a solid
chunk I'm excited to see this resin go so
[SPEAKER_11]: this is two point six grams this
particular one right here This one's I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: concerned about this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all want to see right here and that
one's nine point two grams and that's with
[SPEAKER_11]: the tear So this is literally nine grams
of dry so It's as hard as a rock like this
[SPEAKER_11]: one in comparison.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's like yeah I wish that's what I
was trying to show you guys like like here
[SPEAKER_08]: is gonna be the difference So this is like
like squishing the 304, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying with micron size because it's
what about I do the three or four
[SPEAKER_08]: underneath your 200 mesh screen Because
you can still squish that so when you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: have your screen
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just mostly contaminated if you just
get your microscope out You won't have to
[SPEAKER_11]: guess what you're looking at and that's
why I always photograph the resin and
[SPEAKER_11]: basically show you guys exactly what's
going on Let's show them that first and
[SPEAKER_11]: then they can come wait for the news.
[SPEAKER_11]: We already yeah, we have well we were
talking about it I was showing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's edited.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh this this one first you mean
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny's sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's gonna operate the handle for us I'm
gonna be open and closed guy and I'll use
[SPEAKER_11]: my ear so To give you guys an idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: So because this is hash pressing it a
little warmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not down in the 180 We're in the 225
range today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where we're gonna be pressing it
at so we do the button
[SPEAKER_11]: We're squishing everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so let's let's get you
squishing that buddy This is what we call
[SPEAKER_11]: the pre squish we're gonna give we're
gonna give this dry sift just a five to
[SPEAKER_11]: ten second pre squish get that resin kind
of heated up start
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear it now.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's coming out.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's flowing so really up to you It's
your resin how long you want to leave it
[SPEAKER_11]: on for a 10 20 30 second 30 is a lot at
this temperature, but You want to give it
[SPEAKER_06]: a little crack and we'll open it up and
see what's going on 16 17 18 19 20 All
[SPEAKER_11]: right, this looks pretty good Johnny B
like for what it is you want to grab that
[SPEAKER_11]: right out the middle Pockets smells
amazing put your nose in there So that was
[SPEAKER_11]: the that was mostly contaminant what we
just squished out there guys stuff that I
[SPEAKER_11]: have thrown away So many times I can't
even tell you like I got a pile of it and
[SPEAKER_11]: the smell is incredible It looks like it's
pretty decent quality So I guess sure get
[SPEAKER_08]: it all on one side Now for me I know I
used to leave it And I used to peel off
[SPEAKER_08]: right away to be hard to take off the
parchment, but watch are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooling it want to do it right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was like we can probably pretty
much get that off right away I know you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys see this but as you pull off really
quickly It ends up mostly all on the one
[SPEAKER_08]: side and you can actually fold the
parchment again and together again But I
[SPEAKER_08]: think is that it's not it's not breakable
is it it's not like a shattery type Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's see real quick It's not It's not
that is a thumbs up that is Awesome,
[SPEAKER_10]: that is a beautiful beautiful beautiful Oh
my god, do you see what it does to my hand
[SPEAKER_11]: it's attracted to my hand it's literally
attracted
[SPEAKER_11]: This is so cool I just want to turn it
sideways and show it to them, but it's
[SPEAKER_11]: like the static energy doesn't want to let
me Touch it That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like so that was a great temperature
I like how that pulled together and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: not like the shattery that I was scared of
so I always figure with a too hot a
[SPEAKER_08]: temperature Too long of a press.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought that was making my stuff
turn into like a shattery type I like the
[SPEAKER_08]: idea of getting it off the parchment
without much work like pulling that off
[SPEAKER_11]: was so sweet Yeah, this is just you know
your first What I recall really like the
[SPEAKER_11]: worst grade of the dry sand and
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now this will be the dab This is
what we need I think once again a
[SPEAKER_11]: beautiful gift from the people at 710
parchment Snick and Jen So these are like
[SPEAKER_11]: pre-folded ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to be pre-folding them,
but we are going to be using them as nice
[SPEAKER_11]: big pieces Fresh parchment to lay down
that rosin on top of Okay, now here's the
[SPEAKER_08]: good one we gotta weigh one of these oh,
we'll tear this right now oh Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: good call We're gonna tell you that what
just happened here cuz I'm really Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys want to know right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, they do Alright, so that's one point
two Here we go here's the test so what was
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning stage of these numbers you
would remember I?
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know if I do, but let me just think
for one second.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was nine point two which was the good
two point Seven I think I might have said
[SPEAKER_11]: two point six, but I'm pretty sure it was
two point seven the weight of Material
[SPEAKER_11]: that you put in there you go and so this
which we can weigh as well, so this is is
[SPEAKER_11]: about a gram So you got one gram of rosin
from two point seven grams of contaminant,
[SPEAKER_11]: so this is two point Two point three now
and it weighed two point seven Three
[SPEAKER_11]: points yes, you got a gram of rosin from
basically like less than three grams of
[SPEAKER_11]: contaminant So so that's pretty good John
that's but this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really looking forward to all right,
so we've cut a nice big Piece of parchment
[SPEAKER_11]: here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got the nine point two grams of dry
sift packed up and the unit is open
[SPEAKER_11]: a little higher all right, so I Think you
want to give it a go there Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it a little pre squish
[SPEAKER_11]: We're excited here That's a good pre
squish pre squish spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's leave that there for maybe five
seconds Are you excited give him the zoom
[SPEAKER_11]: give him the zoom maybe when it starts
squishing, okay?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's not jump the gun just ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's stoked All right, let's do it Johnny
B.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to go?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's squish this blow it out nice and
slow
[SPEAKER_11]: Well it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to blow it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the Most important thing when you
do it when you're at this point to not
[SPEAKER_11]: blow it out when you have that beautiful
color One more little click maybe Yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh clear don't your excitement is valid
All right you want to crack it open Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's give it a try
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh straight butter Oh Johnny, oh my god
smell that let's cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just straight.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just straight cake batter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god temperature that looks um I want
to see how happy you are How happy are you
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out of there Oh my god, let's collect
this cake up and see what you got.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh This is like very very light.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy holy holy shit, eh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy all right well do you want to come
lay that down here on the counter and No,
[SPEAKER_11]: collect it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: No no Just keep it That's that's smell
smell that not that's impossible not to
[SPEAKER_04]: smell Cake batter brother cake batter
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a photo Let's uh Let's find out
what you got buddy, so let's find out
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you want to see the differences in
colors between what was considered
[SPEAKER_11]: commercial versus what was considered So
when you get rosin like this now,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what you're buying It's true
right right, and this is a great way of
[SPEAKER_08]: taking a look at it a lot of people Oh,
it's really killer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not but that's great That's what
that's what they're keeping away You want
[SPEAKER_08]: to guess on some amounts I'm gonna I'm
just by looking at that I'm gonna say six
[SPEAKER_11]: point four I'll tell you Johnny.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it could even be more Let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh a little bit less five point three
grams of beautifulness All right,
[SPEAKER_11]: so five point two grams Johnny with a very
close guess at six grams Just give you the
[SPEAKER_11]: absolute I Think all that's really left to
do John is for us to have a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that has to happen So I just put
it in between two sheets here And I'm just
[SPEAKER_11]: letting the the heat plates heat it up
ever so gently like five seconds at a time
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting it a little bit warmer and then
just off-camera here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my D nail manual press You're gonna
be able to hear it when I close it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not plugged in at all But it press it
doesn't nice job though.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think Johnny of like squeezing
out the patty?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like an awesome job Here we go I Just
like this I just go chilly Straight
[SPEAKER_11]: buttery goodness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow Look at that Ros and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is so thick It's got the 710
parchment perfectly Embedded into the
[SPEAKER_11]: middle of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that piece of rosin Okay,
so so we even discuss cameras is if it
[SPEAKER_11]: wasn't cleaned that color Interruption we
don't want our plates to cool down.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm not quiet, but you're 100%
right what John was saying was this color
[SPEAKER_11]: Would have ended up in there and that's
why you get that you would have lost that
[SPEAKER_11]: light light color now there was a You
know, I did run these You know,
[SPEAKER_11]: I we separated out the gland head.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's going to always I want you to
understand if you've got the ability to
[SPEAKER_11]: make rosin Putting all your eggs into one
basket is not the best idea when it comes
[SPEAKER_11]: to glands and I think we've proven that
quite Quite well here today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do you say Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I get you a rip of goodness?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no I'm just gonna eat this I
Definitely would love to try In honor of
[SPEAKER_08]: my buddy, it's a nice straight rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what Bruce Montana can I take
your dad?
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get you a nice little dab really
really really nice You know what to be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to have this and be able to show you
guys I mean what what the capabilities is
[SPEAKER_08]: what you can't do with just simple I mean
yet there's a cleaning process too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's just straight butter straight
amazingness.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome, dude It is awesome Very
excited to be honest You know what don't
[SPEAKER_08]: even want turps in this yet just wanted
this I'm gonna give you a pure pure pure
[SPEAKER_11]: just here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah No problem there.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so see how we ripped that off
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right torches getting lit How's that
for a let you know your put your your So
[SPEAKER_11]: that's the interval timer so it times the
torching and then it lights it ignites the
[SPEAKER_11]: second timer once you go through the first
one ignites and Boom I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I got your carb capped here
Johnny B Excellent got about 29 seconds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your rosin is quite lovely Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really nice thick and lovely
medallion on here I'm pretty sure you're
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna see this all over everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I Think you'll be taking pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure got the glass dabber.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll lay that down in there for you Got
about eight more seconds Timer is probably
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna make some obnoxious sound and then
I'll give Johnny his dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go, buddy Just
[SPEAKER_11]: like that
[SPEAKER_11]: Something to be said for that real nice
sift rosin it's quite different from
[SPEAKER_11]: bubble hash rosin very different from
flour rosin just different All right,
[SPEAKER_11]: let's get to clean that Bring that banger
for Johnny B Because what are friends for
[SPEAKER_11]: if not to clean the bangers, let's get rid
of this kind of Done deal dry sift paper
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice low temp dab beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: They clean up so nice those ones Beautiful
how was the how was the head?
[SPEAKER_11]: How was the taste those?
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us all about it Johnny
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you take a big rip and then you're
like, why does it taste like I know I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at like the On sent now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm starting to get the little heady hides
above the eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's right here, you know what I'm
talking about So it's not like it's it's
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's that nice cerebral.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the flavor is just now kicking in
of the end Dude, you got me all excited
[SPEAKER_08]: for my rip Yeah, no, it's definitely not
activity completed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh activity completed See Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if that was definitely right on
great on part your activity may be
[SPEAKER_11]: completed but mine Has just begun now the
flavors on the lips.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm gonna do kind of what you just
did there Jeez Louise decent size decent
[SPEAKER_11]: size Johnny all generous with his rosin as
always one of the most generous guys when
[SPEAKER_11]: he's puffing his stash always Puffing a
stash with everyone which is good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm I feel like I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always like to do share Yeah So very
excited to hit this hit this little bowl
[SPEAKER_11]: with With the new rosin You're very happy
you look content you look pleased you look
[SPEAKER_11]: satiated Nice quick puff Wednesday for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not gonna do much more.
[SPEAKER_11]: We might press a few buds We're gonna see
what happens if we can get that I can't
[SPEAKER_11]: believe the beautiful butter that we got
at that temperature and how beautiful the
[SPEAKER_11]: smell and the taste is we Will have to
rock it out next time at like 200 and see
[SPEAKER_11]: how she turns out
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we're definitely squishing the bud
you hear that it's happening so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_11]: take my hit here about nine seconds and
Join Johnny B and his positive affirmation
[SPEAKER_11]: of being completely baked and cooked over
over yonder without me We're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: like, you know, enjoy our song
[SPEAKER_08]: The taste on that is unbelievable,
I mean, I know we're always saying this
[SPEAKER_11]: we're always like this is so good this
taste but it does I mean that tastes like
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be interesting to see if the flower
Rosin can compete with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I have to Well, let's do it
let's squish it out Johnny I'm down I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: down for squishing with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're down What do you think of this tech
of cleaning the bangers I really I really
[SPEAKER_08]: like that because someone recently was to
put in the water that I'm gonna believe it
[SPEAKER_08]: now that you have that I'm seeing the hot,
you know Basically looking going into a
[SPEAKER_08]: hot banger and it's coming up perfectly
clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's more Mostly water with a little
coconut extract a little sugar cane
[SPEAKER_11]: extract extract a little Karanja oil It's
really like if you left it open in the
[SPEAKER_11]: container I'm sure that it would evaporate
like probably overnight once again It's a
[SPEAKER_08]: concoction of the different formulas that
they came up with that works Well,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's kind of very similar to this rosin
thing that we're using, you know People
[SPEAKER_11]: aren't really giving us much credit to the
steam the the water that's that's in the
[SPEAKER_11]: urban in the hash because Isn't that
really what's turning to a steam?
[SPEAKER_11]: And acting as a steam distillation and
carrying the resin with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a lot of what's going on
When we press rosin, that's why I saw the
[SPEAKER_08]: difference when I was pressing rosin that
was really dry I mean pressing but it was
[SPEAKER_08]: really dry and then using the bovada that
62% made it different Yeah, we got all
[SPEAKER_08]: that moisture.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of a sudden I'm getting just better
resin more returns as well So why don't we
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B and I will prepare you want to
pull that bag of butter right now So this
[SPEAKER_11]: is the death baba.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got the bovada pack in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's show them the whole bag This is the
bag right here All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are just preparing the Sasquatch
press we're lowering the temperature down
[SPEAKER_11]: to 200 or 190 whatever John wants to
prefer and We're gonna press out this but
[SPEAKER_11]: he's got about 10 or 11 grams or something
Did you did you want to yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: but did you want to like?
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of break it down a little bit and put
it into the bags and do a big bag squish
[SPEAKER_11]: Or did you want to do these as like just
bud squishes and clean the speckles out?
[SPEAKER_11]: How did you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're down to 190 now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're getting to a lower temp.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm 192 for perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why Loa All right,
so dude, dude, dude, dude, dude Presses
[SPEAKER_11]: are gonna cool down over the course of the
next little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I guess we'll prepare this
nugget.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Time to prepare the nugget Everything's
right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is perfectly set up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I'm gonna lay this out for
you guys So that's one gram was an eighth
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at six point three for three grams
We're at seven point one There's a
[SPEAKER_11]: quarter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to do a quarter?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a quarter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna squish a quarter.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, wait We did ten grams of that was the
last nine point two grams of the last did
[SPEAKER_11]: we even weigh that?
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't we had to weigh We did we must
have five points something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah It was five.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was five point two.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was five point two, which is good.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was That was over a 50% return.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at eight point seven point seven
Nine point six.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what did we start with this product
was nine point two nine.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go So you want to do a nine
point six squish to a nine point two
[SPEAKER_11]: squish.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so one tip That Phil gave me was
that you know, you can put the buds in
[SPEAKER_11]: almost as buds But he said to kind of and
I mean maybe he said it for hash as well
[SPEAKER_11]: was to make sure that the corners Had
material in them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: So that the corners aren't empty if you
put in just a bunch of big buds the
[SPEAKER_11]: Corners can end up getting Pockets and of
the screen basically is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take the stock Just have a few buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to do It to many of them
for sure not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we definitely don't need this big
piece of stock.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's covered in resin We'll just press it
right out It's actually pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells really nice So yeah,
just to make sure that these corners right
[SPEAKER_11]: get filled with a couple of tinier
remnants of cannabis then Then we can go
[SPEAKER_11]: in with the rest Get a nice squish going
on And get a nice squish Going on super
[SPEAKER_11]: chill always happy to squish some buds
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know snap in that crack.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah It's been in my drawer for a week
or two at least And I didn't open it a
[SPEAKER_08]: single time Oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, this is this is pretty sweet it's
like marshmallow Give it a give it like a
[SPEAKER_11]: squeeze.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's almost like the hack.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is like it's dense Yeah,
I'll give it a pre-press on the email.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always do although you know what we
don't have to maybe we'll just We've got
[SPEAKER_11]: this cooling down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should probably open this a little bit
and let that heat dissipate No,
[SPEAKER_11]: I would squish this just as it is exactly
like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great As long as these corners are
full that's kind of like the main You know
[SPEAKER_11]: to not let these corners fill up with an
empty spots because otherwise the oil will
[SPEAKER_11]: sit there and pocket God that smells so
nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is gonna be a pretty nice
squish.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to it so Yeah,
we're just gonna wait for this to get
[SPEAKER_11]: brought down to temperature and then we'll
squish.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right guys, so we managed to get the
cannabis all prepared Very nice and dense
[SPEAKER_11]: as we said earlier, so we got a nice piece
of parchment set up Plates are down to
[SPEAKER_11]: about a hundred and ninety three.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're pretty much at that 190 that
we're gonna go for We're not sure if we're
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna do a 40 second a minute 30 seconds a
minute 50 just talking about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll suss it out We just talked about the
temperature and the press and the
[SPEAKER_08]: buttering out Yeah, and what we're looking
at the type of products that if you were
[SPEAKER_08]: higher temperature shorter press
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I'm seeing just different ways of
being able to actually use a machine on
[SPEAKER_08]: itself, which I will be getting that
shortly, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh here close the plates right up I Bet
you that will actually give us the lower
[SPEAKER_11]: temperature that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I kept that little space just
wanted to cool it down in the top plate on
[SPEAKER_11]: the V1 Sasquatch rosin press of course is
not heated only the bottom plate is heated
[SPEAKER_11]: the top plate heats by pushing it up
against the bottom plate The V2 which I
[SPEAKER_11]: have coming here probably in the new year
It is heated on both sides and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: excited to have that unit coming to town
We'll be I'm sure we'll be squishing some
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff on puff Wednesdays Yeah,
we're getting a nice drop we're down to
[SPEAKER_11]: 191 right now and I bet you it's even
gonna be a little lower I don't mind it
[SPEAKER_08]: being a little lower if you don't I'm new
at the Sasquatch press and you know what
[SPEAKER_08]: right now I'm learning and once I get the
new Sasquatch I'll probably will be
[SPEAKER_08]: picking one up since I do squish I'm
getting away from the hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a mad squisher, dude I'm so
surprised you don't have one to be honest
[SPEAKER_08]: You squish more than most people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what works for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what's helping me for what I'm going
through and stuff like that Look at the
[SPEAKER_11]: little magnets All right, so Johnny and I
have been off-camera laughing about not
[SPEAKER_11]: being able to find the magnets that we
used earlier We were completely baffled as
[SPEAKER_11]: to what happened to the magnets We can't
find them anywhere not in our pockets not
[SPEAKER_11]: stuck in on all the metal components that
are nearby and around us the chairs Anyway
[SPEAKER_11]: the the rosin is wonderful obviously it's
got us elevated to the point where We've
[SPEAKER_11]: lost the magnets, but that's okay because
we have the herb Fuck the magnets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's crack this baby open Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty excited about this guy 189 So
189 what do we got we got our pressure
[SPEAKER_11]: still we're yeah Oh 60 we'll raise the psi
I've always been told by soil grown to
[SPEAKER_11]: keep my what is it a 15 gallon Dewalt air
compressor at around 80 psi it's lower to
[SPEAKER_11]: 60 so I'm going to Merely go and raise
that and we'll get right back to this That
[SPEAKER_11]: was quick and easy we got that done.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna go in here with the big squish
What was that nine nine point something
[SPEAKER_09]: grams keep your fingers off of that first
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that I don't
squish it Well, you know it's always a
[SPEAKER_11]: good idea to make sure your fingers don't
get squished in this process because let's
[SPEAKER_11]: be honest We're squishing hash for
squishing bud, but we are certainly not
[SPEAKER_11]: squishing fingers.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Johnny B
[SPEAKER_11]: No magnets, we can't keep this up the way
we had earlier, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: We hear no no plates aren't together yet
Let's
[SPEAKER_11]: see what happens this is the exciting part
of making rosin sometimes Sometimes you
[SPEAKER_11]: feel like you really know what's going on
other times.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what's going on It's always
a learning experience for me by no means
[SPEAKER_11]: do I pretend to be a expert at squishing?
[SPEAKER_11]: buds Much more comfortable with the
squishing of the hash I've done You know
[SPEAKER_11]: some pounds of hash at this point,
but I've only really done a very short 183
[SPEAKER_11]: 183 is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I mean we can leave it a little
bit longer Some people go as low as 130
[SPEAKER_11]: and 140 Yeah Definitely different from the
hash Interesting though isn't it?
[SPEAKER_11]: You see the quality there Johnny Wow,
right And obviously we're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_11]: returns like the flout like the bud or the
hash I should say but I bet you there's
[SPEAKER_11]: still a couple of grams of rosin here
which Well, if it was 1.6, I think it's
[SPEAKER_11]: we'd be at 20% so did you want me to
collect it real quick?
Yes
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that's our squish guys and I can
even see in the corners You can see how
[SPEAKER_08]: it's collected when they talk about make
sure you get it in the corner Because this
[SPEAKER_08]: is definitely you can feel how it's like
caked around the edges here So I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_09]: do the quick get it onto both sides She
says I'm gonna stay on one but now I can
[SPEAKER_09]: tell I can pull it off in nice large
pieces
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely the same type of color Oh,
it's completely light light beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very interested in almost a blind
taste test of hitting these and See if we
[SPEAKER_11]: can tell which one is the flour rosin?
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one is the dry so drug because taste
wise it's like damn you're sorry smell
[SPEAKER_11]: wise They're very very close I mean,
this is what I expected this one to smell
[SPEAKER_11]: like I expected this one to smell like
obviously So,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah nice little little pile of flour
rosin right there We're gonna weigh out in
[SPEAKER_11]: a second on the scale and see what we got
So we've just thrown that herb in for a
[SPEAKER_11]: second batch.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got 1.2 grams of Once again,
just beautiful cake batter buttery rosin
[SPEAKER_11]: goodness, so that turned out rather nice
if you want to see it next to the dry sift
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops just Gently tapped my finger in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see the difference of the colors
right there This is a much more lower temp
[SPEAKER_11]: that we hit it at this was the 180 and
this was a 225 So probably that little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: of dark color in there is from that extra
temperature.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll let you Know how they smoke All
right, you want to crack this open our
[SPEAKER_11]: second batch?
[SPEAKER_07]: So otherwise else I think that was
successful that's the second switch so
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that I think there's probably about
a half gram here and you'll get that 1.7
[SPEAKER_11]: and it'll be about 20% that you yield It's
nice to have the glass dabber from the
[SPEAKER_11]: roar Definitely don't feel overly
comfortable sticking the titanium dabber
[SPEAKER_11]: into the mega pot It's I mean I can do it
with a gentle twist But you sure don't
[SPEAKER_11]: want people sticking it in there and
scraping it around on the courts and on
[SPEAKER_11]: the actual carving that's in the court,
so Would you like to go first Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how it says mothership right across
there here actually, you know what you
[SPEAKER_11]: Take what you want.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just admiring the glass when it says
mothership right across there That's nice,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I will fire this up for you This is
like a real fucking super glue So nice
[SPEAKER_08]: That is It's definitely not snap and pull
Now I'll even try and push that on a
[SPEAKER_08]: higher temperature to see what the result
would be I'm just curious you've done it
[SPEAKER_11]: before I haven't Yeah, I play around with
the different temperatures looks like our
[SPEAKER_11]: torch is running out of fuel As I courts
as I torch Johnny's on
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't touch the army.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so Excellent Wednesday,
I like Wednesday we've squished a little
[SPEAKER_11]: dry sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: I Cleaned a little dry sift pre to
squishing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I photographed a little dry sift.
[SPEAKER_11]: We smoked a little dry sift smoke some
rosin This is good.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got about 30 cents on the table Timer
left and I will try this extremely very
[SPEAKER_11]: low temp.
[SPEAKER_11]: I Wouldn't say overly long press.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean they would know I didn't time it
About 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seemed like it was probably around a
minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've never pressed that long So I'm
really you know for me It was kind of some
[SPEAKER_08]: good experience and then seeing what we
got out of this So really good learning
[SPEAKER_08]: experience from a guy that just use a hair
straightener all the time And you know
[SPEAKER_08]: what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just there's a difference in price ranges
on what people can actually obtain now
[SPEAKER_08]: that we got the machine that works
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice indeed Really low temp just
puddled Just absorbs into the q-tip when
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like that, it's really nice
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh Man that was really nice and tasty,
you know, it tasted just like the bud
[SPEAKER_11]: obviously which is what you want It did
taste a little bit a little bit lighter
[SPEAKER_11]: than the hash rosin Which makes sense to
me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to have another hit of the hash
rosin to be 100% sure but okay there was a
[SPEAKER_11]: Little bit of a lightness to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got the good thing to know too,
right so I'm just getting this thing clean
[SPEAKER_11]: on the religious style and if you clean
your courts religiously Throw a comment up
[SPEAKER_11]: in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me know how it goes for you Let me
know how you like to clean yours.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you I have yet to see anything
as Effective as this for both the outside
[SPEAKER_11]: and the inside of the banger It's just
really quite a good look A little solution
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty much gotta get myself a bottle and
most important for me Obviously is that I
[SPEAKER_11]: don't want to smell it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to taste it I don't want to
have a flavor of it in any way shape or
[SPEAKER_11]: form and I don't so That's good This one's
for you You know, it's like sitting here
[SPEAKER_11]: patient like Very patient.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I did just finish my rip and I
wanted to make sure the bowl Was clean for
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B Lovely
[SPEAKER_11]: Right We'll go to a solid 55 seconds for
you I can't drive 55 I used to like Sammy
[SPEAKER_11]: Hagar back in those days Yeah,
it was not a fan with him with Van Halen I
[SPEAKER_11]: wasn't into any of that But I grew up in
the 80s, you know, Van Halen was David Lee
[SPEAKER_11]: Roth But yeah all those strange hairstyles
Hairbands back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's another that's another story for
another time for now Johnny B is gonna hit
[SPEAKER_11]: this flower rosin and give his Impression
on what he thinks about it as we get here
[SPEAKER_11]: quickly towards the end of another great
puff Wednesday Indeed oh well you're about
[SPEAKER_11]: ten seconds out Johnny I'll throw this on
for you if you like little OFC friend
[SPEAKER_04]: friendly help There it is there it is
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome possum
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks fun You hit it just a little
early didn't you did I well It's the first
[SPEAKER_11]: time I've actually had a bowl cook in the
base like That was just a tiny bit early
[SPEAKER_11]: probably cuz I keep heated it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it still nice and tasty though?
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome No problem brother, we're gonna
get it all off We're gonna get it all off
[SPEAKER_11]: turn It's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love having this cleaning solution that
can clean the quartz.
[SPEAKER_11]: So well, I have to say it's It's very nice
I'm sure someone will what's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's the stuff right there for
those of you that are wondering give it a
[SPEAKER_08]: shout out on puff Wednesday, I am very
much very nicely stoned and Definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling irate Johnny B Hell yeah,
man, so as you put it in like that there I
[SPEAKER_08]: just watched it lift all that away Yeah,
it lifted that last little chunk of chart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just lift and I'll tell you like
that was the first time I've seen this
[SPEAKER_11]: bowl Like get up that was a really close
to like burned but because of the cleaner
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew I'm just worried myself I would
have ruined this bowl a long time ago had
[SPEAKER_11]: I had it because I just didn't really I'd
watch my buddy row and some other people,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know Take care of their quartz and
clean it and I was just like fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not Think I have that ability Because
this is quite a bit to do to clean,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I mean shit I'm getting invested
here
[SPEAKER_11]: All these little things that we can use
and Definitely stoked on this cleaning
[SPEAKER_11]: solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just it only really works in the heat
That's that's how it's beneficial where
[SPEAKER_11]: you get this real sort of hot quartz and
you drip it into there That was incredible
[SPEAKER_11]: John like you saw what that looked like
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, no, it was it was that it was it
was just like where do we get it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well we get it from dirt crystal
glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's selling it at I mean He's the guy
that does the quartz bangers and he's out
[SPEAKER_11]: in Ontario make I believe is his name I
know him for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_11]: He used to work for a riser Okay,
I believe so he sent me my solo years ago
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, shout out to him definitely
gonna bring some cases over here to
[SPEAKER_11]: Vancouver Shout out to van City MFS who
has bottles of it available in Vancouver
[SPEAKER_11]: locally you can hit him up on Instagram
and Yeah, want to finish it off with a
[SPEAKER_11]: rosin rip?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was quite really an experience being
able to see the difference and how we did
[SPEAKER_08]: the bud with the hash and everything and
the flavors and And and really just see
[SPEAKER_08]: even the separation when you did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's yeah, it's really good to see this
It's really good to really uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: I find very Christmas.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also enjoyed it I very much enjoyed
watching the rosin press out the first
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff that came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was beautiful Darker but still very
very lovely and then you know getting this
[SPEAKER_11]: huge press of super buttery caked out dry
sift rosin batter and Then going to the
[SPEAKER_11]: bud and getting this even lighter like
it's almost like clay or completely insane
[SPEAKER_11]: So this one we can kind of put away for
now over here and this is the one we're
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna hit a dab of each now Is that
correct and you just hit your dad so I
[SPEAKER_11]: guess I'll hit the next one Yeah,
I'm just remember cleaning it and being
[SPEAKER_11]: like shit that was the most At first when
I saw it, yeah, because I torched it a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have told you a minute 15
seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have felt it with my hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just relying on we're learning I was
relying on the timer and I should have
[SPEAKER_08]: Relyed on the energy the energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's do this Looking forward to
this little tasty rip dry sift rosin rip
[SPEAKER_11]: that Give me a little idea of the
differences.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had this one once I felt like the
flower rosin was beautiful but a lighter
[SPEAKER_11]: version almost like when you own a 450 exe
KTM and you get the tea the 250 XC FW low
[SPEAKER_11]: ratio and you're out On the trails and
you're blasting that brah and people are
[SPEAKER_11]: like, how do you like that 250?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm always like well, it feels a lot
like half of my 450 so That's what I will
[SPEAKER_11]: say about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is fine I forget I'm like telling
dirt bike stories.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's eight people that enjoyed that
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna ask a question because I'm gonna
have to wait till I ask this question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then you know, it's like just a fair
question I think This is some amazing
[SPEAKER_08]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh listen Listen there is
absolutely no denying that the dry sift is
[SPEAKER_11]: way more intense on every level.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a thicker Meteor more horsepower more
everything it is Absolutely a more intense
[SPEAKER_11]: version of the flower rosin That is 150%
sure in my in my mind But you let me know
[SPEAKER_11]: what you feel right now as you're about to
take yours and I saw you had this like
[SPEAKER_08]: just nice little hit Yeah It's definitely
Makes life very much tree How sweet is
[SPEAKER_11]: this though?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, like just clean the pipe
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a natural oil like a like,
you know, like a coconut extract or
[SPEAKER_11]: something So yeah most pleasant It usually
does one leads into another leads into
[SPEAKER_11]: another Leads into another Let me get it
prepared for you.
Sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: John.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much So you get your dad I
have my dad.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so all you really need is for
me To torch it up for you Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes
[SPEAKER_11]: Get you all ready got about 45 seconds,
but you can do your your energy Lots of
[SPEAKER_08]: energy going on right now Well,
you know, I see a lot of people use the
[SPEAKER_08]: back of their hand so they can really feel
the heat Yeah, I've seen the risk I would
[SPEAKER_08]: feel the back of the hand is definitely
the hottest I could feel that very
[SPEAKER_08]: sensitive a very very sensitive on the
back of the hand and it's just like wow,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just so Well,
[SPEAKER_11]: the timer says 55 seconds, so I bet you
are good
[SPEAKER_08]: Booyah No,
[SPEAKER_11]: this this one cleaned out perfect the way
it should the last one was too hot
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes when you clean this up it froth
Sit right up and it gets the dirt on the
[SPEAKER_11]: lip of the course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm gonna have this little bit of
rosin sitting right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really tasty I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hit that already?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah the MK ultra.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, really tasty really similar to this
flavor Yeah, this is I mean this is a more
[SPEAKER_11]: this is different this is pulling snap and
this is butter Yeah, this is more
[SPEAKER_08]: especially because this one's made from
Before we started this whole process Of
[SPEAKER_08]: squishing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we did a dab of this with a blue
river.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did we hit You hit I think stardog this
started because I'm a sunset sherbert.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, which is also squishy when you say
that Now this is amazing, but that would
[SPEAKER_08]: supercharge that to that effect that we've
got to that effect that I got in that
[SPEAKER_11]: beginning over there was just Yeah,
well that was different hash with turps
