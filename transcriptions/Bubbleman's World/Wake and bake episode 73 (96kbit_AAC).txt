[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I am NOT giving up, can you tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I deleted the old ones, and welcome
everyone back to Bubbleman's world,
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the Wakenpake, back to episode 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, KillerBG!
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's how it goes sometimes,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how sometimes it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are out on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the most beautiful, beautiful of
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here, the mothership is
out on the boat, and it is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the pump has returned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give some bubble bags away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give some bubble bags away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, these are bubble bag lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give some standards away,
probably on the 90th episode, and I might
[SPEAKER_00]: give some originals away on the 120th
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel I'm trying to cheap you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: First pair of bubble bags that we're gonna
give away is a five gallon eight bag kit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the lights, so it doesn't have
all the colors like the old bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what it does have is it has the band
around the bottom of the screen is the
[SPEAKER_00]: color of that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the 160, being the red bag,
and you can kind of go through all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and there's green and orange and all
the different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is going to be simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1999, I came up with the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, it was a two bag kit with a
pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to know from all of you,
or one of you, and remember, I am the
[SPEAKER_00]: pump, so please don't send me a screenshot
if you got it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about who I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see who says it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever I read off who says the right
answer is gonna win these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question for all of you today,
and I guess there's 122 of us in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to confirm that the connection
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's freezing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, what is the newest bag
that I added to the bubble bags after the
[SPEAKER_00]: 220 and the 73?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know the third bag that was
added to the kit, and whoever gets it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to win these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do not know the bubble bag
history at all, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal Cannabis Farm, Farmers of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal Cannabis Farmers of Canada,
you are correct, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal Farmers of Canada gets it with the
25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first bag that I added to the two bag
kit was the 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 25 micron is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, my friend, I have a brand new set of
bubble bag lights coming your way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, can you please send me an email
at bcbubbleman at icloud.com, and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: send this off to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll put a little something
something else in there, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers, maybe a little crisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, right on Illegal Farmers of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support the Illegal Farmers of Canada,
and I hope that you continue doing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you need to do to push the
envelope of practicing civil disobedience
[SPEAKER_00]: until we have everything exactly the way
that we want to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the meantime, I guess we can put
this down and get this party started,
[SPEAKER_00]: because let's be honest, I need a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can smoke now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm breaking up, but hey,
we gave away the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave away the bags, and that's all that
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, congratulations, Illegal Farmer of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are mental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I wish the connection was a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bcbubbleman at icloud.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly correct, Illegal Cannabis
Farmers of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Illegal Cannabis Farmers of Canada,
I hope you're in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be weird if you weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is one of the best elisodes
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, is that tasty?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will and I have, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer was not 73 Simon Scott,
but you know, way to tell everyone that
[SPEAKER_00]: you got it first, even though that wasn't
the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna give this one more
little heat, because it was such a low
[SPEAKER_00]: temper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a nice little blast of the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real short little blast, and that should
give us, oopsie, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should give us another little rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't be in the other chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deleted those videos off my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that guy got the wrong answer first,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you got the wrong answer first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give this one more shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being able to do that on the low
temp dabs, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be giving away more bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will get more opportunities to
win bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I got the wrong answer first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that delicious?
[SPEAKER_00]: And still low temp to the degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I've had a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to talk to my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was, what was the first bag
added to the two bag kit?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came out with bubble bags,
they were very much almost identical to
[SPEAKER_00]: isolator bags in the sense that,
well, right off the bat, we came out with
[SPEAKER_00]: a pressing screen, because we thought,
let's add a little piece of a screen for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to dry the hash off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was through that screen that I
realized there's a lot of hash going
[SPEAKER_00]: through this 70 micron screen,
the 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went and added the 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, the 25 ended up adding a
45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we added the 190 and the 160,
with the 120 being after those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one that we added was
the 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last bag, the one that put
bubble bags to exactly where they
[SPEAKER_00]: belonged, which was just with this bag
favorite of everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone loved that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I didn't even have to use my DC glass
cleaner today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed that Q-tip clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a chas in sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the water is so sick, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about this water that's trippy
is that there are killer whales in this
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are sea lions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dolphins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all sorts of incredible gigantic
and epic ocean life that lives in this
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was one of Jacques Cousteau's
top three or something in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a beautiful spot if you're
a scuba diver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Pacific, the West Coast
Pacific octopus, which I think it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger octopuses in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that large makes something big,
but yeah, we've seen blue whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen humpback whales jump right out
of the water, crash down right where my
[SPEAKER_00]: boat is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I've seen a pod of killer
whales partying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just over by that island over there,
Gambier, I've hung out with a pod of 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we swim here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids grew up swimming in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, killer whales aren't
actively hunting out people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear about it very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What rivers feed into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fraser River feeds into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these creeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the lions up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got your email, Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the two lions right on the top
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get my ... There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called the lions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that is, is why this whole
village is called Lions Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the outside of the lions,
you actually end up at the Lions Gate
[SPEAKER_00]: Bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's also where Lions Gate
Entertainment comes from, the big
[SPEAKER_00]: production company that makes movies and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the house sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the Georgia Strait,
which is just right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feeds into the house sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to have a pink run this year
of salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years ago, when the pinks came
through here, there were 22 million of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the largest spawns since,
I think, 1918.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can Google it, though,
of course, if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: By all means, call me out hard in the
comments section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that I'm a horrible person and I
deserve to be crucified alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling really iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice to be out on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super blessing, hey, Cassinus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't grow up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in the prairies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up as a little kid with the back
lane was where I played and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some other completely different
level of epicness that ... You see those
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go higher and higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind me over here is the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top peak, which is right here,
is called Elphinstone National Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case you guys want to Google some
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was born in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is there an L in salmon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's for the GLA and the GLNA ratios
of ganolinolaic and gana whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: the essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why they threw the L in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, the shit's rich in GLA and
GLNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to throw an L in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron never did show me around the old zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was before my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the few things that I
missed in Ron's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Ron, the dream is still alive
to produce a beautiful greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to attract the wrong
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to produce some giant
fucking crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow maybe $20,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 or 30 or 40 pounds and we'll turn it
all into concentrates and we'll go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing showing from start to
finish, the greenhouse build, the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the harvest, the cure, the processing,
right down to potentially maybe even who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we'll give it away because we're
definitely not going to be sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, we have to block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost did a mistake there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost made that bot admin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone says salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, salmon, salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jacob, you know, that's a tough one
because it's on my property, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's near my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just invite anyone, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, Chillin', I always am looking for
cameramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for people to help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for people who know video
editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for people who want to help
Ron, but I have to be extremely,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't mean that I'm not saying it
could happen, but I'm going to have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting these people and hanging out with
some people for a while before I invite
[SPEAKER_00]: them into that level of my inner circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, MRMelt, you know, it's not that
people are creepy, but it's just that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people are creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me included.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I've come across creepy on a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember someone commented on it and I
was always trying to make like a smiley
[SPEAKER_00]: face and one day I didn't feel good and I
went onto the wake and I did this totally
[SPEAKER_00]: like forced smile and some dude said like,
who the fuck, his girlfriend was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: who the fuck is that creepy ass
motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even went back and looked at the picture
and laughed so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, right on iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming in, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see my house, but I'm not
going to be pointing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly Detroit bubble boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to have to meet someone probably
local, spend some time, get to know them,
[SPEAKER_00]: be in their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, you know,
Johnny B will come and help and D for 20 K
[SPEAKER_00]: will come and help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have friends, you know, Flav over on
the sunshine coast and high integrity
[SPEAKER_00]: glass art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's also good friends with Ron and I
would say he considers him a mentor as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are for sure going to want to
come and hang out and do some,
[SPEAKER_00]: do some helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google earth can be very intrusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you type in italics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an interesting, probably
there's a little font thing that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: change up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm really glad that I gave away
some bubble bags after all this giving
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long enough time for me to give
some bubble bags away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lake actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those are my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not name dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes on Lake does drugs alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it was just kind of like humor,
I didn't get it and it's gone and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sweet how close your place is to
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want Ron as our mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Ron as your mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand this grow is not going to
be so much me doing the grow as much as it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron is the person I want you guys to get
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron is the person I want you all to get
information from because trust me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the information he has is valuable and
he's not getting any younger and he's been
[SPEAKER_00]: a hermit and he's been quiet and he's been
in his own home and I desperately want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get him out on the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every morning on the wake and bakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wake and bakes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, gets it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes out on Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does drugs alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was feeding my endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't know that I'm alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea if there's another person
standing right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea that there's another boat
right nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to make assumptions when you are
watching videos because the person can
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate your assumptions by simply not
pointing the camera at things he does not
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to get people harshing out on me
when I would have a puff in my vehicle and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would split like later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often I would have a driver or I edit
like the hour and a half out where we ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, who won the bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal farmers of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was his name doing drugs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: PK Brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignorance level 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be respectful on the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always make sure we carry a radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always make sure we carry a phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going out of range, I definitely
have the air horn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the paddles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the flare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the life jackets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's all law here that you have to
have these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that you make sure
that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, in the meantime, for those of
you that think I may be driving the boat
[SPEAKER_00]: under the influence of cannabis,
don't feel too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my cameraman right off the the
view of the camera right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that he has had no puffs and
he will be driving the boat and doing just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on, Gabriel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fuck the haters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck the haters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, illegal cannabis farmers of Canada
for making the right guess and coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: with the solid answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, my friend, are going to be getting
the set of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here you go by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top of the morning to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top of the morning to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, laggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got a couple of knee boards,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do some fucking drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what this channel is about,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want people to think that
I'm promoting any form of ignorance
[SPEAKER_00]: because really what I promote above all
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sometimes it's hard for
people to wrap their heads around it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm trying desperately to
normalize the use of cannabis while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: helping educate and sharing this
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is this is valuable
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if you support cannabis
or if cannabis is your thing, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom line is you have an endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body functions better when it is
filled with these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you deprive them of these
compounds and become endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient, you cause yourself much
disease, sickness and yeah, so listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: your son or daughter at the dinner table,
your nephew, your niece, your spouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever it is that's trying to teach you
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the fact that you
yourself are still locked into the
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda that was, you know,
to the tune of billions of dollars that
[SPEAKER_00]: was brainwashing you for the last hundred
years through media, through movies,
[SPEAKER_00]: through all sorts of different
propagandas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the truth, you know, that's that
may be how you perceive it, but the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line is even if you don't like to get
high, even if you are against the
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotypes of the cannabis user,
and that's all they are are stereotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still benefit greatly from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's kind of the whole purpose
of this channel to let people know that
[SPEAKER_00]: the information is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you listen to me, just for a little
bit talk on some of these ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might hear a couple of terms,
you might hear some information that will
[SPEAKER_00]: at least give you the power to go off and
Google and do your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of shit is fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of shit is not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find yourself really good
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know I'm lagging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on fad of Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pens are coming out really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, look at all the plankton in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys see that plankton or probably
not, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, I would hate to drop the phone in
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness, it would sink like a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: No stupid questions took my 20 years to
reeducate my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's kind of how it goes sometimes
with some of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the name of your boat?
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of my boat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the way can bake.
