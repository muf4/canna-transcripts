[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome to Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course we're missing some of our
regular guests.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B and Flav and D420K are all in
Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I miss you guys and I'm thinking about
you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm here in Jamaica, in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_13]: So today's Puff Wednesday is going to be a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have some loud motorcycles
ripping down through the streets of
[SPEAKER_13]: Kingston.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Emancipation Park that we're
going to go to.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go down in and maybe talk
to some people later on and see what their
[SPEAKER_13]: thoughts are on ganja and ganja use here
in Jamaica and what the government's about
[SPEAKER_13]: to be doing in regards to amending the
laws and allowing the people to use it as
[SPEAKER_13]: a medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty exciting times here in Kingston,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: So why don't we start this Puff Wednesday
off with a Puff Wednesday rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have to come inside for a bowl as I
do not have an extension cord for the
[SPEAKER_13]: ship.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I haven't got a torch yet for the club
banger.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks again Dark Crystal Glass in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: DCglass.ca for your killer quartz bangers.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're thick, they're awesome and they
give a really tasty hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what else can I say about them?
[SPEAKER_13]: Puff Wednesday, what are we going to start
it out with?
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some Flow OG, little 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some Flow OG, little 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a little El Jefe, that's 73 as
well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, some Granddaddy Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the one we're going to hit this
morning.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have some Lemon Death Pie and some
more Flow OG and a few other things,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I think I'm feeling the Granddaddy
Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can hear it's just unbelievably stuck
in here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very happy to have the ship.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's just make sure we have,
I guess this will be our carburetor today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright well, Puff Wednesday in Kingston,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bless up!
[SPEAKER_13]: Well that's a pleasant way to wake and
bake here in Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no real idea what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there might be a Kabaka Pyramid
later, a Kabaka Pyramid show along with
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcia Griffin and some others at the
Ranny Williams Center.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm pretty excited about the
opportunity to get over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully Tony's going to join me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And who knows, perhaps Tony will come out
and join me for a little bit of a wake and
[SPEAKER_13]: bake puff here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm going to have one more little
hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lemon Death Pie sounds good.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little Lemon Death Pie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Might as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I love wake and baking in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the rare times that I'm
actually in the room alone.
[SPEAKER_13]: We usually have a dozen people or more.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought I'd start this Puff Wednesday
out by literally, even if we don't go
[SPEAKER_13]: anywhere in the least, what I'll do is
I'll just share everyone's first puff that
[SPEAKER_13]: they come into the room for.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, hopefully we get over to
Emancipation Park with the camera and we
[SPEAKER_13]: can talk to some of the people that are
just walking through the park,
[SPEAKER_13]: get their opinions on what they think of
the ganja laws here in Jamaica and whether
[SPEAKER_13]: or not it's time to change and whether or
not they're embracing this opportunity for
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go Death Pie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be a good Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess this is Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble Man said that I have to take a full
melt dab first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to try out this new silicon
carbide nail, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Been trying it out for the last couple
days and I actually kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's better than, definitely better than
titanium.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had really a lot of time to mess
with temperatures and things like that
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to quartz, but one thing is it's
got a very even distribution in the way
[SPEAKER_08]: the heat vaporized the full melt and it's
really easy to clean and it has an
[SPEAKER_08]: unbelievable taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think these are probably going to end up
replacing all the titanium that you see
[SPEAKER_08]: out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, we've had a couple Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might see a couple new people here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had Prophecy, we've had Richie Spice
and a couple different managers from bands
[SPEAKER_08]: and artists stopping by.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got some different parties to go to
at night and I think there's actually a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot more on the event.
[SPEAKER_08]: What have we got on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Friday?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, tonight we have Kabaka Pyramid and
Marcia Griffins and some other artists and
[SPEAKER_13]: then the next day, I think on Bob's
birthday, we have Kronix, Nomads and
[SPEAKER_13]: Kabaka Pyramid and then the next day,
the day that you leave, there's a big
[SPEAKER_13]: concert that's also like Taurus Riley and
Coco T and Marcia again.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, on Saturday, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're going to have to leave for L
.A.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to partake, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wakey bakey.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Flo O.G.
[SPEAKER_08]: as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is why they call it Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Two thumbs up for two tears down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Puff Wednesday of Bumbleman's World
live in Kings, Jamaica, ready to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: As it warms up, so I'm going to hold
control.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to melt it a little bit first.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see when to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you when.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see, it's going to turn red.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just getting it warmed up a little bit so
it relaxes away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it just kind of heats it up into a
more liquidy state and then.
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_13]: Taking a trip on the mothership.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Tony's just telling Evy a
little bit about the Prana line.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what that does is make categories.
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of saying one strain will help
you, it catalogs the strains into
[SPEAKER_08]: categories.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this one would be sativas that are TXA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's TXA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this one is high CBDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So strains like Charlotte's will have
ACBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is high CBDA, the TXA.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's a one to one CBD to TXC.
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember, they're pure plant profiles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like taking cold pressed oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's raw concentrated forms of plant
cannabinoids and terpenes and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this one's P4, CBD to CDN.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there one he should hit before a dab or
just after dab?
[SPEAKER_08]: This one right here is the P1.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been activated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you like the way it feels when you
smoke a spliff or a joint, this will
[SPEAKER_08]: recreate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I'm guessing he does because I'm not
sure I've ever seen Evy without a spliff
[SPEAKER_13]: in his hand, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: You almost dropped that right on the ding
of the phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, now it's time for... It's going
to take a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to let that set a second?
[SPEAKER_08]: So give it about...
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you roll up a spliff, you're smoking
maybe a gram, three quarters of a gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to be like 50 to 60
milligrams of THC.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lighter 451.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I gave you, and usually you lose
70% of the effectiveness by just smoking
[SPEAKER_08]: the joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're combusting, not vaporizing
it or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this delivers at 99% subliminal,
four milligrams in two drops into your
[SPEAKER_08]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_08]: This you have to look at in sections of 60
milligrams as you smoke the joint,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You smoke a quarter through the joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the equivalent in milligrams
to the drops.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to smoke 70% more to get the same
feeling.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the four milligrams is like you smoking
the whole joint, half that joint,
[SPEAKER_08]: depending on the quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gives you the cleanest delivery
system as a nutrient in a sublingual.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's glandular, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes right to your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's give him that dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time to dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's just dripping.
[SPEAKER_13]: It dripped right onto the table,
in fact.
That's wild.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tastes almost more like a steam pipe than
a spliff.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that for a puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even no puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Music playing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Music playing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give thanks for the... I was just gonna
say it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give thanks for the music, Marlon.
Respect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Debbie's gonna hit a dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: To the smooth vibes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Banner banner.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the CTO.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the technical officer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know the board.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, all my products, patience.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Robert F.
[SPEAKER_13]: You play instruments as well?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar and stuff?
[SPEAKER_13]: I play a little guitar and I play drums,
you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds great.
You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_13]: So when's the first time you heard this?
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna set a road.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to see the road.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because man... Better must come time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Better must come.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because in terms of I don't know if
this counts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebecca, in that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in terms of F.
[SPEAKER_10]: The R-T-F.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, O-C-B.
[SPEAKER_10]: O-S-X.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn it on the youths, eh?
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn it on the youths.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important in terms of form,
bass, vocals, everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every day, put it in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm like... Without that,
I'm not even an artist anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sitting here with a friend from a few
years ago now, Aya Ingi.
[SPEAKER_13]: Back in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really good to see you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I met Aya Ingi maybe three years ago here
in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was singing, but I actually met him
through his juicing company that he had
[SPEAKER_13]: going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So he was a blessing in the sense that he
made... Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it Gemnesia that we would sing?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was by Tony's.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tony's, that's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it still around?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the bar is still there, but they've
shifted the concert, because Contra's
[SPEAKER_07]: Reggae Bible is like a concert series.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they shifted it to a number of
locations and I don't know which bar
[SPEAKER_07]: they're stopping at.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well anyway, a couple years
have gone by and I guess you're doing a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot more music now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we never stopped doing the music.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we were mentioning earlier,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not even like a struggle,
but we have the youth, them and things,
[SPEAKER_07]: so we're always a fair person,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a means of acquiring capital,
because the youth never forgot school,
[SPEAKER_07]: they want to make sure so they can get the
proper education at the same time.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the good work.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why with the music and the juice as
well, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: Livity right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I tell you, it was a huge relief
to me because I don't really like to drink
[SPEAKER_13]: pop or kind of sugary drinks.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a bonus, I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have pineapple, ginger?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, this is pineapple.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is pineapple and ginger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this is pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use the soya bean as the milk base.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's super delicious is all I can say.
[SPEAKER_13]: The pumpkin is the most delicious drink I
ever had.
[SPEAKER_13]: You tripped me out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it got me going hardcore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even when like different artists would
come through, I remember like Coco T came
[SPEAKER_13]: over at one point.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we sat him down.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, hey, would you like a drink?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think he was sitting there like,
what are these guys going to offer me to
[SPEAKER_13]: drink?
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was like, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, I got June plum,
beet, pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he kind of looked at me and was like,
pumpkin?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, yeah, I got pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like, yeah, give me a pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was like, pour a glass of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right away, he knew as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: He actually recognized that that was
really good juice.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Aya has the good recipes.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's able to mix it up in the good ratios
that I'm super appreciative of.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank you for coming by and
delivering these awesome juices.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, man, every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we say with the music and the juice,
we have the concept where we say.
[SPEAKER_07]: So me a go all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ose my food from all boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and the boy hungry fall out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause the room in me belly just a ball
out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So me a go all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ose my food from all boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and the boy hungry fall out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause the room in me belly just a ball
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It rough and it tough out a road.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, see it, you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Them say, oh, you survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you do it, you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I choose me in the street like a street
youth.
[SPEAKER_07]: With me bucket full of carrot and
beetroot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me brain tick in every second like a 24
hour clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: So me go juice 24 more soursop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me not laugh or me not grin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me prefer juice some icos and tambourine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Them say better musta soon come.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me not wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me a blend up some June plum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause the dollar's Russian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me can't get no cash on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So me a go blend up some mango and
passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me not rock cause a high risk that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me prefer blend up some upper one Irish
mash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here now me not back down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make a big order for some map.
[SPEAKER_07]: So me a go all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ose my food from all boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give thanks, I.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on the program tomorrow for us?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what's on the program for Right This
Minute is a Puff Wednesday Puff Down with
[SPEAKER_13]: Kittis I.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just came in the building, respect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bless and love.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bless and love.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we got a little bit of mothership fun
for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tomorrow is Thursday.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what's on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Friday we'd love to go see the
Nomads and Kabaka Pyramid and Chronics at
[SPEAKER_13]: 56 Home.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tomorrow night, there's um, tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: The final?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dope.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dope?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dope, um, it is final.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Around the Redemption Center.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the day, at some point,
I'll remind you to go run over to the
[SPEAKER_11]: farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just 15 miles from here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which farm?
[SPEAKER_11]: A little farmer's farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's, I'm sure that we could make
time to go run over to your little farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so come look at me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the process of working.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_11]: See something is like what we want a
prototype to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you don't touch your finger with
that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: This isn't Kittis' first rodeo on the
Dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Level it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go, nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be a real nice hit.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a new substance you're getting off
of.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a ceramic called silicon carbide.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's very hard and very tasty.
[SPEAKER_13]: No release of any sort of off-gassing at
this temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just really clean.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kittis always can hang tough and puff as
tough as the next guy, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: This Puff Wednesday just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of thought it might have been over,
but we're still going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still going on Puff Wednesday,
and we've had Aya Engie the Juice Man
[SPEAKER_13]: came.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I offer you some juice?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have pumpkin juice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have June plum, and I have pineapple
ginger.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Aya Engie just brought that by about
an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a little June plum in there?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, nice shot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll go do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you tell the Puff Wednesdays,
you know, what's going on in June?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on in Jamaica with gondola?
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the moment,
[SPEAKER_11]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_11]: At the moment, it seems as if we're
getting everything legalized and passed.
[SPEAKER_11]: The areas now which are to be worked out
is licensing and how the participant
[SPEAKER_11]: players are legalized.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reasoning last week, it was
suggested that the farmers get one acre
[SPEAKER_11]: each.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they work in cooperatives and
foreigners as investors who want to come
[SPEAKER_11]: participate to join venture programs with
them.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what they were offering up at the
conference.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you were there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it a two, three-day conference?
[SPEAKER_14]: Two days.
[SPEAKER_14]: Two days, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know other ministers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's health?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Justice?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, justice is golden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm learning all these ministers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Community.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then maybe another one, development.
[SPEAKER_11]: With Paul Burke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul Burke, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: See, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to join us for a little Puff
Wednesday Puff, Tony?
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are puffing right now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're just, Kittis is telling a
little bit about the conference that just
[SPEAKER_13]: happened and what these guys were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_13]: What they were offering in regards to
starting co-ops, getting farmers an acre
[SPEAKER_13]: at a time, creating co-ops, and then joint
ventures so that foreigners that come in
[SPEAKER_13]: can't just start their own independent
projects but require Jamaican partners.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that all sounds pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put a jump start.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put a jump start.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good to see that things are moving
forward each time we come back.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's more to be said.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's more to be told.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me know what you think of the juice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Indy's got it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: He makes pretty nice juice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it good for you, Tony?
[SPEAKER_13]: Puff Wednesday rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this Puff Wednesday, if I manage to go
out tonight with these guys, the Dubois,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll grab the camera and do a little
footage of walking through the front.
[SPEAKER_14]: Finished by 12.30.
[SPEAKER_13]: Finished by 12.30?
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we do go, it's just nice and chill.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Seems like when it goes until 10.30 the
next morning, it's harder for me to go
[SPEAKER_13]: because this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go to a show.
[SPEAKER_13]: People will be like, oh, yeah,
it's a show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll be like, oh, who's playing?
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll be like, oh, Sizzla's supposed
to play tonight.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, Sizzla?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sizzla's playing tonight?
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it's like 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock,
3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock,
[SPEAKER_13]: 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 o'clock the next day, noon.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when Sizzla goes on the stage.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got there the night before at 7.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's antique.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to have the cardboard to go to
just catch a few.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm telling you, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cat nap.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, respect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for sharing some information with
us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we can be linked with is for the
community programs.
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, you have 50 parties.
[SPEAKER_11]: About 50.
[SPEAKER_11]: 50 farmers with one acre apiece?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have none that I have access
to for this quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: These farmers are going to be 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to need to go to the farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes by just 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to still invite us to the farm
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to come see what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm going to let it jump start,
and we're going to want to take it down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Farm in the morning, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of meringue in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: We saw some growing yesterday at the
veggie mills on wheels.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a full mature line.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was fruiting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Had the big long fruit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of looked like okra, but bigger.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like string beans and small ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_11]: For string beans.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the moment, just for seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because seeds are going to crush the oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: The oil is invalid now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, the waste from the oil is for using
in terms of fertilizers and water.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's talking about the moringa tree,
for those of you that don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can Google it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's M-E-R-I-N-G-A.
[SPEAKER_13]: Moringa, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: M-O-R-I-N-G-A.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's like an essential food source as
well.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can Google it and look it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely, well we'll do a little
video when we go to Kittas' tomorrow and
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll share it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you see a lot of that going on
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are kind of waking up to
the fact that they can see cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_08]: super crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: What other crops and medicinal herbs can
they piggyback in this process?
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, to the quiver, over the single
arrow.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to quiver with sure cannabis is
the main.
[SPEAKER_13]: Quite a few of the arrows are cannabis
related.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then like you mentioned about broccoli
and tumeric and other compounds like
[SPEAKER_13]: garlic or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about the veggie meals on
wheels.
[SPEAKER_08]: About soursop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Soursop, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All kinds of stuff that's here.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the green program.
[SPEAKER_11]: You find that the main trees is soursop,
June plum.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are all other types of fruit
trees that come what we call here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Invalid, interplanted, lemons,
lime.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, in food,
we're talking about arrowroot.
[SPEAKER_11]: The what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Arrowroot and the cassava.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh arrowroot and the cassava.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just want to make sure the mic's picking
it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have some of that going on at the
farm as well?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was going to let you know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're two or three hours earlier
than you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sometimes when you call me in the
morning it's 6.45 a.m.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a collar on this?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's different.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a one hour difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much different.
[SPEAKER_08]: He kept calling me at like 6.45 or 7.45.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was trying to get my day going.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I text you a whole bunch and then
I never get a text back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a bunch of one, two, three,
fours.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I realize I'm not getting any of my
texts either.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's calling me on texting.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's calling me on texting.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's calling me on texting.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll catch up more with Kittis tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to keep lazing bulls and
maybe head over to Dubwise.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll catch you guys in a bit.
