[SPEAKER_01]: So 23 million they said you did 23 million
I said yeah Can I have a real piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: paper finally so I'm not a criminal?
[SPEAKER_01]: So things can get done and I think you
need to stand and push forward and take
[SPEAKER_06]: something Yeah, I just want to Maybe put a
little shed a little light on was on that
[SPEAKER_06]: just was up speaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a little misunderstanding
So let's let's go back and understand a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit about what he was explained to
you Mr. Bird what he was trying to explain
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was coming a little too hard at
you if you will but what he was trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: explain to you is that in the United
States and 2008 there was a court case it
[SPEAKER_06]: was called the Kelly decision and That
decision was in California what that
[SPEAKER_06]: helped us out as far as patients in
California was to identify i.e.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the doctor and the doctor would be
like a William Courtney, which he does
[SPEAKER_06]: juice and The example would be that as
hosanna was presenting to you that the
[SPEAKER_06]: three pounds is really only minimal of
what a person would actually need So and
[SPEAKER_06]: that is the fact and that is the truth and
if you did a little research You would see
[SPEAKER_06]: that that is really what is needed now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not everything Everyone that will be
juice But if you set the limits at five
[SPEAKER_06]: and that the example will be this if I
went to the doctor And I had a pain and
[SPEAKER_06]: then he gave me Oxycontin we started at
100 Milligrams for that and of course
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone in this room would understand
that Oxycontin are heroin So of course you
[SPEAKER_06]: will get a addicted and then your
addiction will go up What a coincidence
[SPEAKER_06]: and when it goes up you will take more
heroin and by the time you're done you're
[SPEAKER_06]: a junkie So what I really would like to
help it really apply to you if you're the
[SPEAKER_06]: one that's making these decisions or
someone That's going to go in and at least
[SPEAKER_06]: work for the people is that the five plant
is for the dumb people We really need to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that the planet self depending
on who or what is going on It's your
[SPEAKER_06]: situation it is again the doctor and the
patient that decide on what they need to
[SPEAKER_06]: take not the country not the Laws and not
the police so it's you the people that
[SPEAKER_06]: need to stand up and take charge of your
your land and your rights Because at the
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the day, it's your right to be on
the Medicaid and I don't care what country
[SPEAKER_06]: you're in It's your right if you're sick
and I'll end it with you had a young lady
[SPEAKER_06]: yesterday that I know our company timeless
was going to go out and see and just give
[SPEAKER_06]: our Our two cents if you will and to
understand her pain and her what she was
[SPEAKER_06]: going through for all you that don't know
she was in one of your may have one of
[SPEAKER_06]: your newspapers and Unfortunately wall we
were planning to go out.
[SPEAKER_06]: She passed away yesterday So again,
it's the laws that are prohibiting the
[SPEAKER_06]: health and the movement Well, we sit
around and we have all these people
[SPEAKER_06]: talking You guys have to understand the
Tony you made the point we are and it will
[SPEAKER_06]: be legal I have friends that are in the
White House and it will be a schedule to
[SPEAKER_06]: buy 2016 I guarantee you that and if you
don't step up now and get in the game
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not you are going to the money that
you think you're going to make or that you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to make the United States We'll just
take that right away because you People
[SPEAKER_06]: and I employ you that's gentlemen over
here that says to walk out and stand with
[SPEAKER_06]: you It's time to walk out and stand you
need to get up and get busy and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what I want to see from the people That
are here that's the excitement of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaican people and if you don't
understand you need to understand Then you
[SPEAKER_06]: have a chance to change the way the world
looks at ganja you do but it's a matter of
[SPEAKER_06]: when and will How the government can
actually change this and again we can keep
[SPEAKER_06]: talking we can keep going back and forth
But that's not going to solve the problems
[SPEAKER_06]: that you guys have right now And it's
really catching right now if you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: move this peg Fast and really fast you're
going to see the United States legalized,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're going to capture the movie It
will just be done.
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be over so thank you again for
letting me speak Thank you This is sweet I
[SPEAKER_09]: know we afford that these are served to
flesh out ideas to go along but your idea
[SPEAKER_09]: of small super small For the three years
where the thing is legalized I'd love to
[SPEAKER_09]: ask you if there is a demand for the
product in in three years in before three
[SPEAKER_09]: years What is wrong with the big and small
producing is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this principle any different from all
the sugar operate sugar?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where I was the only discrimination
between a small man came going to take the
[SPEAKER_09]: night money most and the big properties
[SPEAKER_07]: I have tried to What I'm trying to see
when you stop I'm hoping that This is that
[SPEAKER_08]: most of us Must be most of all raw
material must be converted into products
[SPEAKER_08]: in Jamaica If there is a need for product
you allow all families To go up at the
[SPEAKER_08]: smaller level first before you go into the
big power in other words It's like it has
[SPEAKER_08]: five acres and you have thousands of
fathers with Five acres thousand farmers
[SPEAKER_08]: with three acres you go up and allow as
many of the small farmers to get involved
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you need for you said, okay We have
started a body living to do one acre in
[SPEAKER_08]: the first year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us go up to two acres Then you go up
to three acres, but you do that only for a
[SPEAKER_08]: certain amount Whether it's three or five
years when you study the industry when you
[SPEAKER_08]: study the demand Then you talk to the
stakeholders And if they agree look here
[SPEAKER_08]: we need to increase the amount and it was
going to take the small power And the
[SPEAKER_08]: small farmer is part of that decision to
increase the amount I have no problem in
[SPEAKER_08]: the same way I have seen in the first
three years in the first five years I
[SPEAKER_08]: allow individuals a certain number of
classes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you say to figure 20 30 but we say
yes, man This is what you want to do from
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning So I think we have to be
very practical as to how we grow the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry and protect the small But in
growing the industry it is about
[SPEAKER_08]: protecting the small
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to wrap up to the last three
The fellow in the african outfit that
[SPEAKER_11]: young young man in the african outfit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes
The next term is I saw everybody They are
the expo by Sanjay Gupta and it really
struck me to work with a lot of Jamaicans
to see that the research in medical
marijuana could be applicable to things
like epilepsy and all of those things and
I think we need to refocus, send research
council, all those guys who did the
chemist's stuff.
We have a lot of geniuses in Jamaica and
there is a lot of research that has gone
in to where the medical marijuana can
actually aid to heal the nation and I
think that is what I really want to focus
on.
The products that are already out there,
how can we bring them in, study them,
[SPEAKER_02]: those that can help to heal our children
with epilepsy, all kinds of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual plan that I had in place and
hopefully the government will do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: if medical ganja laws were on the books we
were able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are products besides the ones that
we focused on with our capsules and
[SPEAKER_01]: sublinguals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take blended strains and we take,
we start with genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to understand I'm a breeder,
manufacturer, processor and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do everything from seed to sale as
well as implement those products into
[SPEAKER_01]: other territories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually, the reason why I'm
actually here is because of the limit
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that you just discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have limits in Colorado and we have
demands that have with that and so we've
[SPEAKER_01]: developed products that don't utilize
active THC and they offer the full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum of the entire medical benefits of
the plant and sequenced products and those
[SPEAKER_01]: products can get placed by simply
educating, teaching the others and the
[SPEAKER_01]: locals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have two partners actually here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to stand up, just real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are actually my local partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been here 30 and 40 years in
agricultural science and education and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the first step is implementing that
technology and implementing that farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: implementing and standardizing the
genetics and utilizing the local
[SPEAKER_01]: communities to create sustainable
community involvement in the products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are made here, branded here and then
globally exported.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ways to do that and that's,
it starts once regulations in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: then education and then you heal the
nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to add to the query the gentleman
raised, when I mentioned that for us SRC's
[SPEAKER_03]: mandate is to develop nutraceuticals and
cosmoceuticals, the others are the things
[SPEAKER_03]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dr. Courtney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved in dietary cannabis for
maybe 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole new field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The raw material consumed runs in the area
of 50 to 100 times the amount that you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume when it's heated and turned into
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the THC dose is five to 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the antioxidant dose is 500
to 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good guidelines are in the United
States government's patent on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a phrase and effective oral
human dosage schedule, a contemplated
[SPEAKER_00]: range and then an example range and they
end up with, and in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 milligrams to kilogram body weight and
they identify the conditions for which
[SPEAKER_00]: that dose is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I beg that people that are making
decisions about the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that an individual needs, at least base it
on that 1996 information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's much more current information,
but it gives you a very explicit dose
[SPEAKER_00]: that's required for diabetes, heart
injury, cancer, glaucoma and it's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the amount that you would
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were going to smoke 20 joints a
day, you're not going to consume very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now talking about eating 100 worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please allow people access to the amount
of non-psychoactive cannabis that's needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to prevent cancer and preserve their
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in sharp contrast to the amount that
you could smoke, so as we go forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a difficult thing to distinguish how
do we prevent the dietary person from
[SPEAKER_00]: doing other things with their cannabis,
but that's not reason enough, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: to eliminate the possibility of preventing
disease and maintaining health and
[SPEAKER_00]: restoring health because we're fearful of
the psychoactive logos using schedules
[SPEAKER_00]: that really inform all the laws in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this five, six plant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably couldn't smoke that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly need a lot more than
that if you're going to eat it and use it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a non-psychoactive fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I go now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I must say that you both are the last two
persons who will ask questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to wrap up in another five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, in that case, I would now send a
question and frustration to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: On behalf of my colleagues who are not
here, my name is Lascelles Poirier.
I'm a realtor, and my company is New World
Realtor.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a New World seeing the pastor
sitting up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you remind me of Jacob, old Simeon,
when he saw Jesus materialized as my
[SPEAKER_12]: friend.
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, Lord, let thy servant depart in
peace for my eyes of sin and salvation.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is also a New World because here we
are, having been brought up as a Christian
[SPEAKER_12]: and said pastor, advocating this herb
which I was told was grown in Samson's
[SPEAKER_12]: tomb.
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest of you can help me out with that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Therefore, pastor, I thank you for coming
here because if you travel from Moran
[SPEAKER_12]: Point to Negril as a realtor, you see
Jamaica is an empty land.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with this coming to Jamaica,
I'm hearing about billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're speaking not Jamaican dollars,
but it's US dollars, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So can you imagine all of us would be
benefited?
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I would be because I have land all
over Jamaica, for sale, together with my
[SPEAKER_12]: own colleagues.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank you, pastor.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank you, Mr. Burke.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have been fighting, and I'm sorry,
Court isn't here for me to thank him also.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Tony, we are going to lead you back
into Jamaica because there is a house
[SPEAKER_12]: right in the hills around Jamaica,
living in these big houses, and they will
[SPEAKER_12]: have a little pot in their house at the
back of the garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you are planning to do that because
I am sure I've seen someone in Stone Hill
[SPEAKER_12]: some time ago plodding in their house and
they were arrested.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will need you here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the medical doctor, although you
warned us in the beginning, as we must be
[SPEAKER_12]: careful how we use it ourselves,
I wouldn't use it like some people do,
[SPEAKER_12]: but definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: My benefit, my benefit comes from selling
land, land, land, land, all over Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank you all, and this is a new day
for me, and I look forward to the great
[SPEAKER_12]: benefit and help in promoting this
beautiful town.
[SPEAKER_11]: The more people want land, the more
business you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hallelujah.
[SPEAKER_11]: May God be with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told that I can only start
short, so I'm going to try and
[SPEAKER_04]: contextualize this the best way I can
think.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Sunday, I buried a very dear friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was in an accident in 1995,
and he lost a piece of his liver,
[SPEAKER_04]: his kidney, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now because of this chikungunya thing,
this chikungunya took him out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother died from an asthma attack.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother died from diabetes.
[SPEAKER_04]: My father died from cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get this thing in context.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of the people in graves that
day would be alive now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, this is how important this
thing is, and we're still playing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked this question two years ago in KC,
when is the Jamaican public going to get
sick?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're serious about cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wasn't even allowed to speak to the
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could only speak to her, wasn't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Susan Simms, and she ran me out of the
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know this is a school?
[SPEAKER_04]: So where else should I speak?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this thing is serious, and we have to
get this thing in context.
[SPEAKER_04]: The world is a war zone, and we are here
to clear it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are our brother's keepers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just imagine this place like Cuba with
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuba with money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuba has a very good system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about love.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't matter about the amount of
land you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about how much you care about the
people around you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have it and you can afford it,
let it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do we need on the planet now with
the death around us?
[SPEAKER_04]: The destination of the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some serious stuff, and we're
playing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could speak for hours, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: But we only have one minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me say that you asked the question,
in which forum shall I speak?
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the forum.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the exact reason why the board and
management of the scientific research
[SPEAKER_11]: council gathered experts from all over to
come and sit and share the ideas,
[SPEAKER_11]: and so that all the ideas could contend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if people understand what is at
stake, how valuable it is, and how you can
[SPEAKER_11]: minimize the negative effects,
then we can move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I add one thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because there's been a couple things
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see, a couple comments were made
about this ganja wealth thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about health, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I said that the industry,
when you look at the nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, and you look at the plant-based
medicine, natural herb industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can affect and help millions and
millions of people on the planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: billions of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that translates to billions or
trillions because of the healing
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you explore the full potential of
medical cannabis in its raw form,
[SPEAKER_01]: in its semi-active, and its fully active
form, there's different methodologies and
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery methods for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will explode into products,
into different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that opportunity and that ability
to help 70 or 80% of the public on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet is what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Jamaica has a very good situation
and position to get that going,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone that I've heard talk
tonight, and this is just from the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, besides the political portion and
it moving faster, slow, everyone in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room wants this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single person understands the
medical value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a professor, you have a pastor,
you have every angle covering the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody wants what everybody wants
in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to approach this in a
systematic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to do it in a way,
whether you like all the things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know everything about, Paul,
I've just heard everybody talking things,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know all the things, but you have
to take it in a systematic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to release things and not be
scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first thing I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how you perceive the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just spoke about regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regulation and then education.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can make the regulations,
because the people can help to define.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now how you educate the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have channels here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is so many documentaries about
ganja.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just flood the people and educate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just run ganja documentaries are we.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we must continue the progress to make
ganja the product, the plant of choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just three questions for thought,
no response needed from the panelists.
[SPEAKER_10]: One, how many products will Jamaica be
producing from ganja?
[SPEAKER_10]: Should it be legalized for medicinal
purposes?
[SPEAKER_10]: Which ailments are we going to be focusing
on treating with these products?
[SPEAKER_10]: And how much ganja will Jamaica need to
produce to satisfy that demand?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I thank you for those three
important questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will think about and talk about some
more at the church, or should we say at
[SPEAKER_11]: the lounge, past.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the church, at the lounge,
wherever we need to discuss how we can
[SPEAKER_11]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been a very good audience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, we at SRC are so happy to know that
we got this kind of response.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we promise you that we'll continue the
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll continue to do the research so that
we have the dream fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the dream continues.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have come to the end of this session,
this day of the conference.
[SPEAKER_11]: And remind you that tomorrow we'll look at
investment opportunities and new
[SPEAKER_11]: businesses from medicinal, ganja,
and natural products.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have people from the Bureau of
Standards, we'll have somebody from the
[SPEAKER_11]: Kimora Bailey Foundation.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have people who can sit down and
tell us how we can really make it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: How we can really make it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: We thank you all for your contribution.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, we'll have a good night and
get home safe.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
