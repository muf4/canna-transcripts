[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys!
[SPEAKER_03]: John B.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Bubble Man back in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, just outside of the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of the house?
[SPEAKER_03]: John just rolled up for Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have seen on his Facebook post
that he was going to set up a medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana garden tent today and lo and
behold... It's your house!
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, so what'd you got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you bring us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you bring us?
We got a little bit of everything here.
That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we're going to take these off
the top because we wanted these to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots on because you got such a cold... Oh
yeah, these are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are 4x4 Grotac tubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically they're going to fit the plants
just perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I picked up from your
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got these new bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we got the Digilux high output
digital bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are metal halide lamps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the spectrum analysis on the
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: 75,000 lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really curious about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen these before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the NanoLux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these look so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The revolutionary ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened up the top and I was like,
okay, I got to stop right there because
[SPEAKER_00]: the next step is you showing me these look
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set this down right here for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I can do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we have to have is of course
venting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air movement I say is the key with
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You lack air and one of the things I've
noticed in a lot of gardens that I've shot
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years that one thing they have in
common with a lack of air is they usually
[SPEAKER_03]: either have a high amount of mildews or
they have a high amount of bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bugs don't seem to like the big air mulch
movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you keep your plants happy,
the temperature is down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 4 Honeywell power circulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't go like to like Canadian or
anything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to my buddy, he owned a company
called H&M and he hooked us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got four of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this Dux Flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen this before, so I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check this out for six inch and I was
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with two brackets and this duct
tape feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like really surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many feet is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say 20 or 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to need one for something
because we have six inch and eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got these mobile sockets,
but what we've done with this is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different because these don't come
with shade so we're going to use those
[SPEAKER_00]: probably somewhere else because we talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we've got the Adjust-a-Wing
shades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone loves the Adjust-a-Wing shades.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are, I believe, what the great
gardener grows with.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Adjust-a-Wings and of course,
up to Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Planet linked us up really nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check those guys out if you guys have some
hydroponic needs and I'll also be linking
[SPEAKER_03]: up a website in the title of this video
for all this other stuff I got through
[SPEAKER_03]: these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a distribution company,
but I'll be linking you through to stores
[SPEAKER_03]: that also sell these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: More ducting over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: More ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is going to be the eight inch
for that wicked fan right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've got an eight inch Hyperfan?
[SPEAKER_03]: He just brought me a six inch about maybe
two months ago and man, I've never fallen
[SPEAKER_03]: in love with a fan, but I got to say out
of all the little toys I've gotten in this
[SPEAKER_03]: new growing experience, I got to give it
up to Hyperfan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like buying one of my own products in
a sense that when I got it, I felt right
[SPEAKER_03]: away that it was quality and that it was
good and of course, it ended up being even
[SPEAKER_03]: more and better than what I thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a eight inch fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: 75 watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, 75 watts with 1,206 cm an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, 75 watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: My other one's 35.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your other?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, your Vortex?
[SPEAKER_03]: Six inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: My six inch Hyperfan was 35 watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny little thing can clear my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: My air in my tent instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I saw that 10 CFM at 75 watts,
I was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the Honeywells.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the Hyperfan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we got the Ultra Hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great for the adjustable wings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are so killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are definitely key.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the little carabiners in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like nylon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up to 150 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can worst off some zippy strips to
adjust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zap straps are essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things we don't even know that we
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: The zap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want me to lean in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's all about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got you this flame defender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Automatic self-contained fire
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now John is a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just doesn't talk the talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does walk the walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to build yourself a little
garden, understand that you're not a
[SPEAKER_03]: professional sometimes in all the
different aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not a professional,
maybe the best thing to do is cover your
[SPEAKER_03]: ass in any and every way that you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: This being a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself, your growing
environment, your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this will be basically in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a sprinkler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stay over top of your timer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just foams out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes above 95, that will let off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically your plants are dead
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are its power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, hey, better than burning the
house down, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the big thing right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four lights, 15 amps, 120 and 240 volts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not do it the right way if you're
going to do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: All these products are an imperative part
on growing properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little things you think you don't
need, like the simple timer, becomes the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest nightmare you could ever possibly
imagine trying to wake up twice a day to
[SPEAKER_03]: turn your lights on and turn them on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one extension cord for each timer
and like, dude, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are causing fires and stuff because
they're being unsafe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a cruise time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hook your fan up to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it actually gets a little too hot,
thermostat turns on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your room is never above 80 degrees
because this will always vent out for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another great idea to make up for
potential human error and to make up for
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we can't foresee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those random days where it's supposed
to be 15 or 20 degrees, which I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: would be about 65 or 70 Fahrenheit for the
Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden it's, you know,
30 or 40 degrees that day Celsius,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would be about 110 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thermostat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course I got you the humidity
of thermostat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's key too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you know with this one here,
you can set so you know your minimum and
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the lights go off, you're going to
know humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't actually imagine not having this
simple piece of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: John brought one by with the first tent
that we set up in my office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every day I look at my humidity and my
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote everything down for years to find
out how everything fluctuates.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the hyper fan, because before you
brought the hyper fan, really is a
[SPEAKER_03]: testament to the temperature that it keeps
my tent at on 35%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never have to turn it up full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on 35%, which is as low as you can go
with a hyper fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a variable read, a little dial
and you can only turn it down to 35%
[SPEAKER_03]: power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty quiet at that point,
but it's still working.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps my tent at 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never goes warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the other day when it peaked at about
20 degrees, my tent was like 76 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are definitely also, I would
really say this is an important part of
[SPEAKER_03]: your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll get the table out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll set up the camera at a different
angle and we'll show you guys all this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff sort of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, we also have the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even shown you the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, those are key as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They refer to some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is we're going to pull this table
out, kind of set everything on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can work off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set everything up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rough cost here is, you know, we're going
to give you the cost of everything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's roughly about $15, $16, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably nice to work off a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, it is a four by eight secret
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the DR240.
[SPEAKER_00]: W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same one I had at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: The secret garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a DR240W.
[SPEAKER_03]: The DR240W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with one of those and then
moved over to a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has it all going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a good guy, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely give another one away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are key for people growing
their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we talk about as being
able to grow your own medicine at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to show you how we all
grow our own medicine at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for the cost of maybe under
$2,000, you can have a set up where you
[SPEAKER_03]: start producing resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the great things about these
videos that John and I are showing you
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, and you can check out John H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfello's channel at John H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfello on YouTube as well for his own
separate grow videos, is that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: show you how much resin you can grow in
one of these tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to tell you, well,
I mean, I am going to tell you how much
[SPEAKER_03]: bud I get as well, but it's not going to
be weighed, dried, trimmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like, look, I got this much wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this much dry resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be about resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be able to tell you how much
square foot you need to produce how much
[SPEAKER_03]: resin per month to set yourself up for
your resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody's asking with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do I need to grow to grow myself
one gram a day of resin?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question we're going to answer
in the upcoming months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what this is all about right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude, let's get the table up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got the tent ready to basically pull
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open the box up anyway.
All right.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all in a nice bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes in a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bag it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to have the table right beside you
here.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tells us how to put this bad boy
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be required.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have many different bags of posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would suggest that these bags of posts
are not to be all mixed up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the liner that goes on the inside
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the inside liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be your little windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bag will come useful for when we
move it to someone else's place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have that on film as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's those hooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to have to put this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every one of these are numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have A, E, B, B.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be our rails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take this right across the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've done so many of these,
I've actually probably set up like 30 of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be our top so we can just move
these right out of the way for now so we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to be in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here on the snowmobile, there's going
to be our four main corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to set our bottom base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll open those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the directions don't have a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to get all the A's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly simplistic directions, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all our A's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do this so I can get my bottom
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know how big your tent's
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: See like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one goes there.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the two middles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shows that these four corners.
[SPEAKER_03]: See these corners?
[SPEAKER_03]: Try those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, not these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to make sure we have that right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good to have a friend to go
over this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a couple sets of I's are better than
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even set the set to 30 and I'm still
going to read the instructions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you the instructions,
too, real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice little sheet here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's also got a step by step.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're basically in this step right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to set up the base.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we get that done, we'll move on
to the next point of business.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just basically set this frame up ever
so simply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was real easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got that put together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull those B's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass me three B's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are tapered at one end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually put the top together
to make the height.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you heard what John said, the tapered
end goes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're going to be adding the
extra metal piece to get the height.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want me to plug that in?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand what up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it stands up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to put the top on
pieces at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think all at once would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's so not heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're grabbing just the plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like all the parts that could
fall out have already fallen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have already fallen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just come over and plug them all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure if I don't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're at the point where we just
have to basically zip it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zip it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pull this top over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can zip it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a top that has to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was trying to do it in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tent accomplished.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should open up the front door and take
a look inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that, people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I mount my fans in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there isn't that much room,
I like to get them up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I just start taking this
out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I drill holes in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to go right through the
bottom like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you kind of want to keep it close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, of course, it's just a pole on
each side, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the light is in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our switch that's going to blow
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, and now the fan's
perfectly mounted in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust it and it blows the wind on
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put these in all four
corners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the way I mount my fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got all four of our fans mounted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two on the left side and two on the right
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: A quick zap strap tip from John B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to take this little piece
of grate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we're going to mount the
little timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the way that they have it,
they make it difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I came up with this ingenious little
way of I cut this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to tape this on there and
zap strap it to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to mount the timer
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way we can start plugging things
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to take the piece of
board to mount the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to come in here like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much because our power and
everything is running off of this corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you want the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to mount this little thing
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got this handy little tape because
it's tin foil tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks nice, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just little handy tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make life easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to put some zap
straps on them to make sure it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: good and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to zap it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to mount the fire
extinguisher up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the lights will be right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The master lighting control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should verify the ballasts you plan to
run with the MLC are properly internally
[SPEAKER_03]: connected to a 120 to 40 volt operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got ourselves a MLC4X master lighting
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me, B, John B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get that done.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So John B's mounted that really quite
nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in place and ready for the next.
Adjust the wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adjust the wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medium size for a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those big ones are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're definitely not going to fit
inside of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that nice little package.
[SPEAKER_00]: How these come apart here is really quite
how I love how they do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a little protection on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other side is this little blue
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to peel this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put this thing
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, putting together these
little grow tents are very, very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, like anybody can really do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the hooks on each side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we put these together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you slide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next step, as it shows here,
you put the little folds on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you've got right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice little product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're just so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then simply use the wires to loosen or
tighten them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Angle the lights at different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how easy this comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local socket's completely attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mounts on the underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is wire that into the
ballast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plug that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the ballast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right into the ballast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all the CSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all great to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll plug into the ballast just like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: EL approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's plug and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of ballasts will... Oh,
that will... All new ballasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the older ballasts... You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most ballasts are all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're going to mount that in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just screw that little guy right in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the other one on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need a hand holding that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it grabbing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty easy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to unwind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, each end's got two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here has got the different holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one here has got the single.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to proceed with putting
this one right in this side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to set this one off to
the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part about these is they just
bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can stick this in here like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrap this around here like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pick your length that you want it
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually pick your different sizes
there exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, which decides the length of the
cord, which decides how angled the
[SPEAKER_03]: reflector becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's open, but if we got the 10th
there, we can kind of give her another
[SPEAKER_00]: full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And go into this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple, simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nice little almost, not very
metallic, are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plastic-y like... Yeah,
they work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've definitely seen them at the great
gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest part about it is there's
just no screws, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to grab these hooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to check it out, but you turned
your back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so here is the NanoLux.
[SPEAKER_03]: The inlet cord right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to get you a 110 plug.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice looking little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a little dial there too,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dimming, different percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like that's going to plug perfectly
right into this, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fits perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a matter of figuring this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to get to, it's just your basic
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our hangers ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put these onto here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And undo this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the little button here so we can
kind of do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we do is you lift this around,
then we hang it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just put one on each side?
[SPEAKER_03]: And one on each side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like my light in my tent right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the lights in your tent right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to mount those
ballasts right on that little board
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath of that other one we have over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go rock this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quite easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a light or a reflector ready
for a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're just showing you how we're going
to adjust it properly and how Mark wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to have them in here, if he wants to have
them sideways and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much how easy it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this because normally I have one
ballast in here and I had a 401 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: truck is what I had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this here is just so convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like me to give you a hand there
at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold that there and then you've got both
your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move it down about that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be able to put the zap strap
through the back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going right around how we did
the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strap in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like zap straps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to work quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, zap straps are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zap straps are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go kind of through the back
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just have that other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through here like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it ain't going to go side to
side or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's something you'd want to
have nicely secured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things you got to look at safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, we're going to cut this
one off here, how we just did the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it look all nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hyper fan time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hyper fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my favorite part, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love the fucking hyper fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there's a little remote
control there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like really, it's so light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, 75 watts light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you think that weighs?
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 pounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to do this, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to hold it up there for you?
All right.
Whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to move?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it up, and I got that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to move your hand for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're just going to get our last two
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt on the outside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to put that fourth screw in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm going to get it done right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this fan, I'll tell you one thing,
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not want to leave this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when the screws that he put in all at
angles, I have to say I was a bit nervous
[SPEAKER_03]: because this thing has to be tight on the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hyper fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hyper fan loaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: This tent is getting full, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: This tent is getting full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to put the ducting right
through here for the 10 inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got it all ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, peek in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we've gotten to installing
the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our security here happens to be a fire
extinguisher because really that's all the
[SPEAKER_00]: security we really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already mounted it up in the top
corner pointing down right above our
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anything goes wrong, this is where a
fire is going to start, is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the mobile socket or the bulb,
but this is if anything's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe something will show it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if that happens, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automatic fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: House is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stellar little tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this is a stellar tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched you open yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Stan.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, they've got this almost like a little
piece that would fit into your shoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut to the bulb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at these bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get these bulbs out without
touching them with our fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a little velvet little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just holding on to it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to get in here and screw
this sucker in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been into touching my light
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that I feel more
comfortable not touching the light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get those oils on the bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we really have to do is plug in our
ballasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we're missing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we missing, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the other plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other plug for the ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the plug right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you have the plug for the ballast?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think you did, but you said you
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I was going to re-question
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some heavy... Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is now the next day, and the tent
has been finally set up with the lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our exhaust with the hyperfan
through an 8-inch tube that's going out
[SPEAKER_03]: the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just going to start putting
plants in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really stoked on the ease of use of
this tent, how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, yeah, I can't say enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, John's helped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have to change our controller.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put the Sentinel MDT1 in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one actually wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought the NanoLux ballasts weren't
working, but they're actually working
[SPEAKER_03]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take you just through the tent here
for a quick little tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get our white balance organized.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, HP... HPS lights times two 600s with
the Adjust-a-Wing fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our NanoLux ballasts,
which you can hear these guys have little
[SPEAKER_03]: fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intake and outtake, one on either side.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our Sentinel, so we can have all
of our fans plugged in on this side.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our light here, and then we've
got a light off, which I'll also be
[SPEAKER_03]: plugging in some of these little fans,
which aren't turned on just yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my one little watermelon in here
so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's looking happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got more room than she's ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you can really see this thing is a
resin producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is going to kick out the goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all in all, I'm pretty much stoked on
my little garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm going to go up and get John to
help me, and we're going to bring all
[SPEAKER_03]: these plants down, and then we'll show you
one final shot of the garden with the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, we'll just go from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll let you know how much dry vegetative
weight, sorry, not dry, because I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be, well, some will be dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to dry a couple of plants to
hang for dry sift, and the rest I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do wet washing, one plant runs per.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's going to be a unique way for me
to collect my resin, and I hope you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: stay tuned and watch, because there's
going to be things to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're back again, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have come back, and John is beyond a
good friend, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things didn't work yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our board, for whatever reason,
we haven't figured out if it was a fuse or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot, so we replaced the fuse with the
Sentinel MD-T1.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got both the lights lit up now,
and we brought our plants down,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've staked them.
[SPEAKER_03]: John put the hyperfan ducting in inside
the tent, as well as to the window,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we have our exhaust set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to turn that up,
sir?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, let's crank that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great suction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful suction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look how quiet it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's full.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, when you turn it down to
35%, it's still pumping good air,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can honestly barely hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we've staked up these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all being held up by themselves
in the little tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the one mother, or not the
mother, but the one big astro boy sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: in there already, and I guess it's just a
matter of throwing some of these guys
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, put some of them in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the man!
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, then there's something else we need to
do, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would you like to put the plants,
sir?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before we put any plants anywhere,
here, I'm going to take my shoes off.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I did too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go into this tent with
John, and we're going to have a little
[SPEAKER_03]: ball in the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the Hitman baby cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pull it forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of hiding behind that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hiding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tilt that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, get right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got room for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some water in the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been sketching out on quite a few
of our videos where we just get all
[SPEAKER_03]: excited, and we don't even put anything
water-wise into the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really don't need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that clean and that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It truly is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Swiss Kirk, the mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain pipes do hit unbelievably.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to move over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're literally hiding behind that wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat up this side for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be nice and cooking for you,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the side that your hand is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to help out the ones that like to
help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you to variable-click that fan,
and we'll show them how fast it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: clear this smoke out of this tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crank her up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting sucked right out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm watching it right now.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really can't say enough about these
Hyperlight fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it would be neat to own and have a
grow where every single product you love
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as you love that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to hold the torch,
and I'll give you that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this little baby case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy that you picked her up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to actually get in touch with the
guys from the plant and make sure I paid
[SPEAKER_03]: for this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just wait there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid with bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're carrying your product now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've actually carried my product since
day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like the original Spanish guys in
Barcelona that really started using the
[SPEAKER_03]: bags first.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew what was up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great guys, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can't say enough about these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really starting to look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone wrote it on one of our videos,
or even it was on a photo of resin
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, and that's truly what we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're resin farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just trichome farmers, but resin
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not really interested even in the
entire glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really only interested in its head.
[SPEAKER_03]: We chase resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the resin chasers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the resin chasers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We chase resin all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we might be chasing resin in Jamaica
next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, we're in my garage chasing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were at my house last week chasing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be chasing your resin,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be chasing your resin,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, why don't we put these plants in here
real quick, and we'll leave them with that
[SPEAKER_03]: final shot of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sitting right here, so if I'm
down, why don't you pass them in to me,
Brian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just threw the old shoobs on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermelon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bent watermelon that I had bent over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to put the watermelons on this
side, so we have a few of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you the other watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the watermelons across the back,
which would be your front.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the watermelons.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can throw this guy literally right here
to have tall Sativa, my little pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got our Chem 4 reunion and
our Medi.
[SPEAKER_03]: In she goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here's me getting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's John getting out and Medi.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to put the Medi in,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There she is, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to have to show them
what you've got going on in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so our little action corner
with our fire extinguisher, our timer with
[SPEAKER_03]: our fans, and our exhaust, our lights,
our two digital NanoLux ballasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loving the fans on those NanoLux to cool
themselves down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intake and outtake on either side of the
fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Medi Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starring, and we have starring the Medi
Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up we have Chem 4 reunion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very limey carrying it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the back, we have Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how it's just starting to blow like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but certainly not least.
[SPEAKER_03]: My little pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This little wispy sativa, packing her in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's still going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little twin nuggets right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Week 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: My little pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all in all, we have a happy weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my 8x4 tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: John helped me beyond help.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are in here blooming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any more that are blooming
for now, but I've got some in veg and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: got some clones that I'm taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the next four weeks, the majority of
these will be turned into hash and hung.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will refill this tent up real
proper with probably about six or seven
[SPEAKER_03]: strains in which we'll also finally begin
to tell you exactly the weights that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get from resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of this 8x4, two 600 watt tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
See you next time.
