HPS light in it right now.

about to flip that to an HPS drop this

to seven hundred seventy thousand lumens
[SPEAKER_01]: and a thousand you moles at canopy level
two inches away I've heard a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be careful with my canopy level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to burn Looks like it's got a
ton of lifetime hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows exactly how to set it up for
hanging It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say I'm looking forward to
following the proper instructions I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: probably hang this tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I'll video the actual
hanging of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens This is just the
light spectrum That it has giving you in
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to the LED lighting and then it
also came with a chief green bud So it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like some music smoke as much as you
like the drug bust swag puff puff pass a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend with weed and 420 somewhere So I'll
listen to those 420 friendly songs I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to thank you guys from lush for you know

[SPEAKER_01]: made me want to consider doing it so
without further ado And I really like the
[SPEAKER_01]: the packaging on this is incredible
Absolutely incredible here
[SPEAKER_01]: Side so we can turn this around for you
and show you how beautiful this is Check
[SPEAKER_01]: this bad boy out now that my friends is a
light bulb 1 2 3 4 5 6 times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 9 10 Damn 50 as I got to about 36.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized they're all numbers Each row so
50 rows of six to eight Six lights that's
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 lights that are in this little bad
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look super top quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tiny little diodes Sort of melted
right into the metal there plus and minus
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really looking forward to trying this
bad boy out I'm going to take it over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent change the camera setup and let's
get to that right now Okay, so I'm now in
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent a little bit tight in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the two times XL dominator this
thing weighs Serious weight, it'll be by
[SPEAKER_01]: far the heaviest thing I've ever hung in a
tent like this We're gonna make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's secure But these great little units
right here that they come with which are
[SPEAKER_01]: quite convenient Nice strong cable And
they set it up kind of no-brainer style
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's too uncomfortable On each
side Let's get this somewhat upside down
[SPEAKER_01]: here Alright, so this is as simple as you
got your carabiner and we're gonna hook up
[SPEAKER_01]: two on each side Really nice built units,
you know, they really feel like something
[SPEAKER_01]: you really got something with this unit
That's saying something these days All
[SPEAKER_01]: right, so you drop those in there there's
Two on either side and there's three sets
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they give you three of these little
bags This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, especially with a light like
this You don't want to leave it to chance
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are gonna jerry-rig their own
sort of method Well, it's my little
[SPEAKER_01]: ballast that I still got going on I
usually try To shut down all the fans
[SPEAKER_01]: while I'm filming I could hear the fan
going and I was wondering hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you how excited I am to
get this thing up and hanging and lit up
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like everyone's on the LED train
these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not looking to replace all my crops
with LED, but in the least I like the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of having an LED tent or even better I
like the idea of having a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: tent LED and metal highlight high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: How cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to listen to anyone's
experiences, but my own and I'm gonna play
[SPEAKER_01]: around and I'm gonna experiment and That's
gonna involve different forms of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem You've got the hours of
operation use this train Track the
[SPEAKER_01]: lifespan of your fixture so it has a start
date that you're supposed to write down
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can use your hours used.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try and keep a nice little
journal with this guy so Let's see what we
[SPEAKER_01]: got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be Superman styles to hang this
guy now
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and I think this one will hang
Okay, those are still hanging good
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting and this has got the power I
might need A tiny little extension cord
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how long this is gonna be No,
it looks like we'll be okay So it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: three pin plug Definitely haven't seen one
like this before has a little slot So it
[SPEAKER_01]: can only go in the one way if you're
plugging in one of these for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time Make sure you pay attention to that
that little slot Be a good thing to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to I kind of like to have this
out of the way there, but we'll see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens There we go, I think that's a
little bit more even and I can just
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly tie that up to keep that secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just worried about the one bar here
It's a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's pretty secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know to have the double bar
connection I'm gonna get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: tape and we're gonna tie that All right,
even better Let's get this guy turned on
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's zap strap it Or a zippy strap as
Johnny B likes to say do a little zippy
[SPEAKER_02]: strapping There we go Would you look at
that isn't that just a lovely looking
[SPEAKER_01]: thing All right, I'm gonna get out of here
Move my box a little rundown on that So
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the LED light Looking oh so
colorful and shining down onto these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and then over here we've got the
Metal halide for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be turned into a high pressure
sodium a little bit later here Let's get
[SPEAKER_01]: these a little closer I'd love them to be
in both ranges LED and high pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium So this is it guys, this is the
beginning of my experiment with my second
[SPEAKER_01]: tent we're at June 18th today June 18th
and Everything's in I might do a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of edging for another few days and
flip Them right before I leave for
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica, which is on the 24th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're gonna give these guys
another week I'm gonna veg them up nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and good and we'll see how it goes
Remember, this is my sweet skunk Congolese
[SPEAKER_01]: and East Coast sour diesel.
