things Secondly I recently did a spread

for us To do a little puffin Got my hitman
[SPEAKER_04]: Got my fresh frozen astro boy my skillet
tool and my torch So I should be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: get the job done here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always find the skillet tool is a little
bit big for this particular piece,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Now we should be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be able to get her done
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite something even even heating up
the nail is a little bit of a challenge I
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely love my D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nail for this very reason I find the nail
is a little bit You never know especially
[SPEAKER_04]: outside if it's actually working there we
go I got a better view on it now Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to take the D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nail out today I've been doing a little
bit of work with D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nail with Brian and Nick Stevie Not sure
how much I'm allowed to say, but we're
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of working on a little project
together kind of trying to Well those guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are pioneers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no doubt about it, and I think
that they recognized Some of my value and
[SPEAKER_04]: the fact that I really use these things a
lot that their products I take them all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the world I use them in different
scenarios And I really sort of put the
[SPEAKER_04]: product to the test in a way that a group
of guys like that who are constantly
[SPEAKER_04]: pioneering you just know they're gonna
have an appreciation for someone like that
[SPEAKER_04]: and Indeed they do All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see if we can get a little hit
on this thing Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no doubt about it that worked I
definitely got a rip I Got my new method
[SPEAKER_04]: seven shades on there's something I wanted
to talk to you guys about these new coupe
[SPEAKER_04]: The coupes really like the style kind of
that Ray-Ban old-school style Ferris
[SPEAKER_04]: Bueller or whatever you would have I've
been using my Sun resistance These ones I
[SPEAKER_04]: guess this is the the regular Pair and
I've been absolutely loving these and then
[SPEAKER_04]: I met James from method seven at Pacific
Garden Northwest Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_04]: gardening supplies vendor day and what a
great guy really knowledgeable super
[SPEAKER_04]: information if you if you guys are looking
locally in BC for method sevens you can
[SPEAKER_04]: get them from igreenplanet.com or Pacific
Garden Pacific Northwest garden supplies
[SPEAKER_04]: and If you're looking for them anywhere
else, you can check out method seven comm
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you these coupes are really
great They had they had sent me a pair of
[SPEAKER_04]: the new coupe HPS with the mirrored glass
lenses and I went and shot at Tilray a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of days ago and I'm not sure if he
was one of the owners or if he was one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the head growers, but I let him put on the
coupes and He wouldn't take them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically told me that he needed to buy
them he's getting more for all of his
[SPEAKER_04]: gardeners at Tilray and so I was real
happy to set that up and link those guys
[SPEAKER_04]: up together because obviously Tilray's got
you know a Couple thousand lights burning
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of people in those rooms their
eyes are being affected by by that strong
[SPEAKER_04]: powerful light So always a good thing to
have your method sevens These aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly a pair you'd wear in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a pair for the Sun, but yeah,
I sure love them
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you a serious testament of how much I
like these I'm quite a shade snob I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been using Maui gyms for the last 10 years
and I've gone through many many many many
[SPEAKER_04]: pairs and they're 350 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not cheap Anyway, I've got a brand
new pair of Maui gyms at home right now
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the case and I've been wearing
my method seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to tell James that and I think he
was definitely like wow That's a true
[SPEAKER_04]: story Well, I'm gonna take another rip
here and then I think we're gonna boot
[SPEAKER_04]: around just do a little circle of the
house sound and see if I can't Maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: locate some dolphins and the whales
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard we're up in the sound up in
Squamish So maybe we could head over to
[SPEAKER_04]: the backside of anvil or something and I
want to show you guys the whales I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: show you guys about dolphins because it's
definitely a level of excitement that we
[SPEAKER_04]: have not yet achieved here on bubble man's
world when you get out on the boat and you
[SPEAKER_04]: see the whales or the dolphins I just I
Really get giddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turn Into like a little kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very big animal lover.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if you guys know that about
bubble man, but it's part of the reason
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a vegetarian I'm not really big on
killing and eating animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're great and I can't imagine
just you know, having the love that you
[SPEAKER_04]: would have for your dog But then you know
just eating a cow Cows are pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that's the end of my hippie rant
Time for another bowl
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love the hip bad That's some glass
that I would carry a fresh head is I have
[SPEAKER_04]: to say hit man Has nice glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's something I should do get in
touch with hit man and see if we can't get
[SPEAKER_04]: some of this glass on full melt glass calm
What's wrong ours?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey It's a little boat shy sometimes Maybe
wants to go for a ride catch up with you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys All right, so we're on the back side
of Boyer Island and see the lions in the
[SPEAKER_04]: background those two big mountain peaks
and This is the only part of this
[SPEAKER_04]: particular island that is inhabited So
yeah West Vancouver right across the way
[SPEAKER_04]: on the other side of that mountain is
Vancouver Then you have Horseshoe Bay up
[SPEAKER_04]: here Where I catch the ferry when I go see
Matt the great gardener and I go to Tilray
[SPEAKER_04]: any of those sort of adventures Yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes The Habitat is West
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver across the way a beautiful
cloudless sky And All in all a good zone
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going with the flow thinking you
guys might appreciate Just floating by
[SPEAKER_04]: this island.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this might be a good time to
load yourself up a fat dab twist up a
[SPEAKER_04]: fatty gear up because we're gonna do a
couple of minutes of Just enjoying this
[SPEAKER_04]: island look for seals Eagles Dolphins
maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: Backside of this island is often where the
mama seals will leave Their seal pups
[SPEAKER_04]: while they go hunt for the day So you see
baby seals quite quite often just laying
[SPEAKER_04]: on these rocks They do blend in quite
well, but if I see one I'll Stop the boat
[SPEAKER_04]: and zoom the camera in the best that I can
pretty cute little little guys It almost
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like one but it's a rock Wow
[SPEAKER_04]: About 400 feet deep here on the side of
this island.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got flying by seagull?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah little seagull Really beautiful
island to kayak around Surprised there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no pups in the Sun It's the right part of
day for it
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a baby pup there's a little baby
pup Couple actually four or five all in
[SPEAKER_03]: one little zone I'll try to get closer
without aggravating them And see if I can
[SPEAKER_03]: get in here and show you guys So the one
on the left is the one I saw first the far
[SPEAKER_04]: left You can see they're just kind of
littering the rocks there Sorry it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: shaky I hate that sort of Shoddy camera
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of seals here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even notice like 10 or 20 Not
necessarily babies some of them are
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway there they are I don't have my
telephoto I guess I could take some
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures for you guys and add them into
this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I got a little closer for you
guys and I snagged some pictures for you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys My dogs just now realizing that
they're there on the side of the rocks
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a few over in this corner,
too Back up don't like being too close to
[SPEAKER_04]: the islands and I don't want to encroach
on them too much We haven't bugged them
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't moved so Have a good day
bacon seals
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the really beautiful and
cool things about living in British
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia is things like that being able to
Float by on your boat see 20 seals or 10
[SPEAKER_04]: seals or five seals Just chilling on the
side of the rocks like that Let's go see
[SPEAKER_04]: if we can't catch some eagles now looking
up in the trees bald eagles mate on the
[SPEAKER_04]: backside of this island so there's often
Always generally one or two of them
[SPEAKER_04]: Couples, I mean two to four bald eagles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should catch at least one of them It
is a pretty vast forest up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of looking for the
white head It
[SPEAKER_03]: was our neighbor Driving that boat
[SPEAKER_04]: We're heading into the house sound now
that island in the background that Appears
[SPEAKER_04]: to have no top is called Anvil Anvil
Island There's not much going on over
[SPEAKER_04]: there other than I believe a Christian
camp Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess while we're floating around this
island we could learn a little something
[SPEAKER_04]: about our endocannabinoid systems Not sure
how many of you guys are familiar with
[SPEAKER_04]: your endocannabinoid system But it is a
system that helps regulate most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: biological functions that occur in your
body How well you remember and how well
[SPEAKER_04]: you forget how well you sleep and how?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you wake up when you get hungry and
when you're full how well you go to the
[SPEAKER_04]: bathroom all these certain all these
different biological functions are tuned
[SPEAKER_04]: and put into homeostasis via Your
endocannabinoid system and the proper
[SPEAKER_04]: feeding of that endocannabinoid system
Which of course doctors tell us to consume
[SPEAKER_04]: amino acids omega-3s and omega-6s.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually eight essential amino
acids that humans require to survive and a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of more or three more I believe For
children, so they need 11 and we need
[SPEAKER_04]: eight Anyway, those amino acids are
building blocks and they help produce
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoids Inside your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what endo means endogenously Those
cannabinoids are produced via the building
[SPEAKER_04]: blocks of amino acids But you can also get
more help and saturate your
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system by consuming Phyto
cannabinoids which are exclusive to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis now phyto cannabinoids CBD CBN
CBC CBG THC all these different,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know them all I'm sure these these
function in our bodies to help regulate
[SPEAKER_04]: and our endocannabinoid systems and put us
into a state where We don't get as sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are less susceptible to disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are able to prevent things like heart
disease stroke diabetes These are all very
[SPEAKER_04]: important factors in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look them up, they're very high
disease rates the highest disease rates in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world heart disease and stroke
Diabetes and the cost of them on the
[SPEAKER_04]: health care is astronomical So just simply
allowing us to consume phyto cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: and when I say consume I please don't
think that I mean just smoke the smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: please when I say consume Please don't
think I mean just smoke because truly what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm what I'm talking about is I'm talking
about the creams the transdermal patches
[SPEAKER_04]: the sublingual drops Edibles and then of
course vaporization as well Smoking has
[SPEAKER_04]: its place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can stimulate appetite quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can relieve ocular pressure quickly it
can produce wonderful euphoric feelings,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I believe are medicinal and
preventative in their own way and Yeah all
[SPEAKER_04]: around to saturate that endocannabinoid
system when you can and I'm gonna leave
[SPEAKER_04]: you with that because I feel like I'm kind
of going on and on now, but Thanks for
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out on the boat with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was real fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't Really have much more to
talk about in regards to ja herbs and I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't really show you many hashes or
herbs but We saw the beautiful house sound
[SPEAKER_04]: on really like a nine out of ten day And I
think that's that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm heading up to Whistler for the next
couple of days So you may catch a bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: man's world from up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see what I can do Thanks for watching
guys peace
You You You You You You
