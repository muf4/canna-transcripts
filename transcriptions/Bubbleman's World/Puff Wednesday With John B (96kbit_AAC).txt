[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm in his house right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get out to this end of the woods
too much, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm telling ya.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while since I've been here and
it's definitely been a while since we
[SPEAKER_04]: filmed together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought our audience deserved a Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been so busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been busy, I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been concentrating on certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of things going on in the world of
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: and Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys follow Hash Church,
you know a little bit about our company in
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica, Canabinoid Research and
Development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, myself and John have our own
companies here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's maintaining MedTainer Canada and I'm
maintaining Fresh Headies, as well as FH
[SPEAKER_04]: Filtration.
[SPEAKER_04]: We figured we had to make time for a Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out this way on a bit of an adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: John said he'd join along.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to head out to Hope,
Hope, BC and hopefully have a nice little
[SPEAKER_04]: session out that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some pretty epic beauty between
Abbotsford and Hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should be able to stop by a
river.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the area pretty well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Bridal Falls.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few cool places out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try and stop at them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll definitely be a fun little
adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's made some beautiful dry sift here
of Matthew Gray Gardner's Barber Bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a contender.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the dry sift?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my whole little thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you can try the difference between
that one and the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's one for you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start us off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just used that empty one as a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works real good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seals right on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a nice little
adventure today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure where or how it's going to
go, but I'm pretty stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually got a pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just about to come out of the oven
here right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's flashing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to mow that down on our way to
hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that looks so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: First thing I'm looking at, and you notice
how that's the first thing that you did is
[SPEAKER_07]: you protected my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think you were going to bang it,
but I figured just in case, my hand would
[SPEAKER_04]: be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the flower mate as well as the
mighty vaporizer as well that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: bring with us on our journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's got some beautiful Jamaican from
the stream that I gave him last May.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been about a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a few months after I crashed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the first plant that I followed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks super dank and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real nice lime green color.
[SPEAKER_04]: A very almost odd smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get back to know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost minty when you opened that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already squeezed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made some rosin and we've hit that
already, but I have not hit this barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't I do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit barb?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just mean now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We filmed this once already and the mic
wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now this is our second attempt at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit different than it was
the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys will never know what we said the
first time because we won't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lip readers might know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can do little cuts and don't get
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's been happening is pressing out
ash is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the stuff that presses the best for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm more getting into pressing the ash
out, but for me all I've been pressing is
[SPEAKER_04]: bud as you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'll be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let's press some of that because
I forgot to mention the gentleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember his name now.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Dank Supply Company,
at least one of his companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got this cool kind of logo on the
tube here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me a couple of these tubes,
sent me a cool t-shirt as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wear it one day and mention him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he sent me some of these ceramic pens,
which are similar to a trippy stick,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least by appearance to the minis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just wanted us to try them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to give you one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can give it your honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so unexpectedly cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, aside from five minutes ago when I
gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was going to say, it's my birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, it's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's nice to get the gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love to destroy pens.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what works.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really hard on them too, I have to
admit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have found trippy and apex to be
the ones that I usually roll around with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I tried boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, it worked pretty good until I
broke the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you had a broken globe over there as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Several.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've broken the glass on most of the
units.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not calling out any one company.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all doing their best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really all about doing research.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many different pens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't think of a pen as
something that I want to use every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in my life, when I'm not around this,
and then I'm out and about, and maybe the
[SPEAKER_04]: torch just ran out, at that point it
becomes a great option.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if I'm in a concert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concerts, that's what has been the key
player lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: A meeting maybe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Meetings were good too, Safeway lineup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Safeway lineup, movie theater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the movie theater.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all good options for the pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we give you thanks, Penatech,
and we will be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go eat this pizza and head to Hope?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, after a rip, you showed me this
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the combo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, H.
[SPEAKER_04]: H.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the HPS Barbera,
and that would be the LED Barbera.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one was Presto.
[SPEAKER_07]: This here is the Congo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your LED is way stronger of a smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got so much less of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is way more of it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but it was like that when I got more
resin from the LED.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got like 2.4 grams of LED sift and
Static Clean, and I got 1.1 of the HPS.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I found it was a real learning
experience, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent six months on that project.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I learned that the Medi Kush with the
Danker Buds didn't give me the yield that
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting in the resin, as in when I
have the two different there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get more rosin from the HPS with the
Kushes, but I get more resin with the
[SPEAKER_07]: Barbera, with the Congo, with the My
Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's always best to have them both.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really just playing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have the variety of lights,
maybe, and not choose one over the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just tested six plants, the light to see
if it worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first test.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's dialing it in and learning
more about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure they're changing new bulbs
already, and they come up with different
[SPEAKER_07]: lists and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Brad Higgins always posting unique
things about bulbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 watt bulbs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's got some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to head off on this
adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll bring you guys with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a rip.
Guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the river.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bubble man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're heading up to a waterfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were a little bit worried.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have a torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the endless problem with D-nails,
not having an inverter to run the power of
[SPEAKER_04]: the D-nail or not having a torch to heat
up your nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the D-nail, no inverter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the dabs, no torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So luckily I remembered that I had grabbed
the Mighty and the Flower Mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've each got our own vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's got some beautiful herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still going to head up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why we feel so compelled to
have to puff for these videos,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I guess it is a big part of the
videos, the puffing aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are going to have our puffs and
we're going to head up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, join us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a...
We're going to have our puffs and we're
going to head up there.
Yep.
This is
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a beach over at the far end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, dude, I kind of wish we
had two 100s in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be so much fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd just be like, let's just bury the
little kids that we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, look at them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could maybe set up a little session
over on this log.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I just picked up this dirt bike for
my son and my daughter, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what John and I were just talking
about, it's kind of hardcore to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bike like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trails literally right over here.
Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to set ourselves up here and
we'll see you guys in a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found ourselves a nice little lake
here, Silver Lake, and we looked
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere for a torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked everywhere for a inverter to
power the D-nails that are in the truck
[SPEAKER_04]: over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't find one.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was stopped by my dad's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We even stopped by John's dad house.
[SPEAKER_04]: He apparently brought the torch and the
inverter to Uma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in Uma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of all the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know where the hell that is,
but it sounds like it's hours away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we decided with the Flower Mate and the
Mighty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these two little Dodgers are going to
be our sessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a preference here,
Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: The closest one to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was kind of funny is as I was
running out the door, I grabbed a
[SPEAKER_07]: medtainer that had a button in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's exactly what we need right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: A medtainer full of bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do you want to just squeeze it up and
break, break it up in your medtainer
[SPEAKER_04]: style?
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we're just going to grind it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us some pow pow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us some pow pow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, beautiful mountain back here on the
backside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that is some epicness for certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's actually a piece that it
comes with, a little sort of plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: grinder piece that screws into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's got the grinder that fits on
top of it and you just grind it right into
[SPEAKER_04]: the unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've just always used the medtainer
and just kind of done this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can tell you how that works too.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never tried these before,
so it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your herb will go in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll just screw that on top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll hit this three times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll turn on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think you hit it a couple more
times each time you want to raise the
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature of five or 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to raise the temperature and yeah,
that's, Hey, you know, it's can we,
[SPEAKER_06]: can we stash stuff in there too?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the one thing that's in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just turned the mighty on pretty
simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Push the side button.
[SPEAKER_04]: The digital display turns on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's in both Celsius or sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the, the, the temperature that you
want is in the bottom and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature that it's at is on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see it going from 63 upwards to
climb towards 203.
[SPEAKER_04]: So got this one on Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just make sure one, two,
three, one, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was five.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it's blinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe it blinks until it gets up to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once it gets up to temperature,
you can hit it a few more times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and you'll change like it goes,
it goes from blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes from a blue, uh, to red or to
orange, to red.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're knocking over your buds there or
what?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happens when you don't put the
lid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the lid won't go on without this
piece on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice if it had the dual lid
properties there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have put in here already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to go like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine is just getting up to 200 degrees
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So mine's good to go, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be getting there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them both.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was a little more confusing for
me because it took me a while to realize I
[SPEAKER_04]: could tap it a few more times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get the temperature up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one's just really easy because it
tells you literally you're at 199,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're at 200 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of nice sitting here doing a
nice bay pan on the lake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm definitely, uh, I've never
been to this lake before, so this is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually a first for me coming to this
particular lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit more of Johnny's neighborhood
than myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, he pointed it out and said we
should make it up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you guys want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many endless places in
British Columbia, just like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: literally any river, any lake,
any sign that you see to a waterfall or is
[SPEAKER_04]: generally going to be of, of, of epic,
epic beauty.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not just, uh, not just your
average, but really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of nuggets down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I just, there's lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how they sit right in nice on the
moss though.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's really nice is because these
are all little rock hard little mugs that
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting ready for rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't say rosin anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're on the rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting them ready.
You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think next time we should come up here,
we should go for a swim.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit cool today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're close.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting really close to the summer
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, mid, midway through may camping
will start for a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_04]: already has started.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still cools off a little bit at night
and some of the mountains still have snow
[SPEAKER_04]: on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not these particular ones, but there was
one right in behind us over here that's
[SPEAKER_04]: covered in snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just depends on how high up you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can usually find it even in August.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll have to go eat some lunch after
this or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to get the, uh, got to get the boat
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's going to happen
today, but these are all the things you
[SPEAKER_04]: got to do in summertime when BC and the
weather changes so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to get the toys out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to ensure motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the Argo out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it all fixed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to see in the mountains how things
have broken away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool to just see how we're going to
be sitting here and you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see it in the back country often.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see avalanches.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just be staring at the mountains and
then all of a sudden you'll just see a
[SPEAKER_04]: little avalanche start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not huge ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never witnessed giant ones or
anything, but I've seen some pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome little mini ones, you know,
nice, like waterfalls of snow tumbling
[SPEAKER_04]: over the, over the cliff side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder where my dog is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just cruising around.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oreo's digging this.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit windy out today, probably
mucking up with our dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our audio a little bit, but we're just
going to hang out and finish a few more
[SPEAKER_04]: vapor bowls, maybe find that waterfall and
we'll bring you with us each time we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope that you like these beautiful,
epic mountain scenarios as much as we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone can sit in their house and take
bong rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to bring you guys on an adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well guys, we just had a funny experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just rolled up to the cactus club.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the all time favorites for food on
the west coast here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty delicious menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an awesome menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll show it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll show you some of the food when we
get in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't usually share too much food when
we're eating, but we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, what did we find John?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the door of my truck, a small can of
butane and a blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the mothership and the DC banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suspect he had some rosin and some
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some, uh, L H O and some full
melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're hitting a few bowls here in
the parking lot before we go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You missed it on the lake, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the lake was nice with the vape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have to admit.
Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really quite, quite happy with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really quite happy too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom, boom, shaboom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom, boom, shaboom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's nothing like doing a nice
little D now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even a D now.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I like the D now so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's heat it up right on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a little, uh, it's a two man
job sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two man.
[SPEAKER_04]: To heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best part about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute the session's over,
we are inside to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the mad mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so hungry and thirsty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're quite welcome, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess probably wait a few seconds
for, for that rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have, um.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too worried about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably puffing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst case scenario, they aren't and.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can just whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the joys of licenses and medicinal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that looks tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's having a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe she put some oil on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like she might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, uh, low temp dab right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still actually hitting a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burn that off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hit it right in the, in the bottom
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab me a hit there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little size hit here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do one more each of the L H
O.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, that's the lobster bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the, uh, the only real L H O that
I hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how Oreo's just got his head like
literally right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just such a good dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good little dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a good dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing like so tasty,
so smooth, so delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: No irritation.
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and just quite nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to follow it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then why aren't we talking about that in
our church about, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people try not to cough for a minute,
but when you're smoking the hash and the
[SPEAKER_07]: Epic, you don't cough.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to worry about trying to
not cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not unless you take some you know,
oversized rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really, you know, it's going to
make any, any person cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not really doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of lightly medicating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lightly medicating micro dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not really micro dabs because
these are much bigger than the dabs I
[SPEAKER_04]: give.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to scrape that off for your
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm to smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I just saw that I was like,
that's going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have helped you out with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you notice it sits perfect on the back
two prongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely like this little unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cool this off quite a bit
more for the LHO due to the fact that it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't really bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oil melts obviously because it is a liquid
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's a solid, it still becomes a
liquid instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water hash and dry sift has the wax
membrane.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wax membrane takes a little bit of
time to break down, start boiling and then
[SPEAKER_04]: gain access to the inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always a better idea to leave
it a little bit longer than you would with
[SPEAKER_04]: the dry sift or the wet wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the rosin though.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting is I never really used
to let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hit it really hard all the time and
learning from what everybody is doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's the best part, is going down to
those temperatures, even trying,
[SPEAKER_07]: lowering my DNL the other day down to 500
and then I was turning it up and I got
[SPEAKER_07]: really nice hits around 630.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was finding some new temperatures for
myself too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was literally a perfect hit I just
took.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Horatio would even be proud of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guarantee Horatio would be proud.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like his baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sits at home and spends hours and days
doing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing the good work right now,
I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is definitely doing some amazing work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping on doing a part two with him in
the upcoming months.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what he has to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always on Horatio's terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just eager to hear from him and when
he gives me the call, I'll let him know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hit him up and we'll show you guys
the next part of the inner sanctum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let that one sit just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn excited to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little rip there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright guys, we're going to go grab some
food and see you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the chicken wraps have arrived.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken wraps, we've got squash ravioli
with prawns and candied sage leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuna tataki.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a sweet, fine tuna tataki.
[SPEAKER_04]: I myself am having a Caesar salad with a
little piece of salmon in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the flatbread.
[SPEAKER_04]: All in all, quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to finish up here and we'll
see you out with the next session.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we are here with Enrico from
Sublimator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B and I were on our way back
from... Geez, where were we?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Bubble World?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope?
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in Hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Bubble World, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hoped all day they'd show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, we were late.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were probably like 45 minutes to an
hour later than we should have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were paving on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were paving on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were giving you starters
for desserts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we were standing there to leave
and we were waiting to get our food packed
[SPEAKER_04]: up, that's when we really started feeling
the sort of like, listen, we really got to
[SPEAKER_04]: leave and get there now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because we were going to have a
wicked session when we got there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also because our friend was waiting
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, without further ado, tell us what you
got going on here, dude, because this is
[SPEAKER_04]: all new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually glad you brought your older
unit with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to revamp it and give you all the
stuff that was missing that we came up
[SPEAKER_01]: with lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sure did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the V4, which is attachable to
your already existing unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put this here and the card cap is
directly on top of it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you put it on our new sublimator
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all heavy glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works with anything, works with the
sublimator or you can actually smoke out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it if you still desire to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, basically that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what we do is we'll take like a tap to
the ground because it also worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, so you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you've got this thing all heated up
and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was waiting for you, so I have nothing
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, John, so I'm going to move this
for you right here so you can try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, now you're on low temp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got your card cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still lift it up or just lift the
card cap?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lift the card cap or lift the
whole thing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, whatever your card cap is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went too slow on the intake,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too slow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a particularity to the
sublimator, and I know where Enrico's
[SPEAKER_04]: coming from, because I find myself,
when I use it and I get everything right,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then when I don't do it right and it
doesn't work, I'm like, oh, why is this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing not working?
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single time it's happened,
it's been my own lack of paying attention
[SPEAKER_04]: to a certain variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you saying, leave the card cap on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can guarantee you I would have left that
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people do leave it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave it on, you're just going
to have a different thermodynamic to your
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a card cap that is cold and
you put it on, which represent about 15%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mass in front of you here,
and you put a cold card cap on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you cool off your unit right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have the same effect that if
you just lift it up, and once you put your
[SPEAKER_01]: organic or your soft organic or hard
organic resin, once you put your card cap
[SPEAKER_01]: on top, it will create another reaction on
top by having the cap also heated up by
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can't speak today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with me?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, one of the things I noticed in
a big way where a lot of people thought
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was all about the sublimator wand,
and I kept trying to explain to people,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that bowl is as important,
because I always noticed if I didn't keep
[SPEAKER_04]: this, that perfect temperature,
you'll just vaporize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this was just to keep it at that
temperature and get it to that
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most people really think this wand is
the sublimator unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the sublimator, the wand is actually
the first part of heating up your herb or
[SPEAKER_01]: your concentrate and mixing it with the
highest, how can you call this,
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing it with the most, how do you call
this, the most thermal radiant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can by passing it through a lot of,
it's a little too hot for us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to bring it down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, that was a beautiful hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for how well it vaporizes or it
sublimates, I guess is more of an accurate
[SPEAKER_04]: term, but it really is quick and fast and
it gives this punch that you're kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you just don't get from most units.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm going to have fun with?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be throwing my 25 hash in there that
doesn't melt in the bottom and that kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like a pre, this is like also a
rosin machine in a sense, except you can
[SPEAKER_04]: just hot air extract your rosin out of the
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: It creates rosin as you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use, if you do not use,
if you do not use a, like a DHO or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like this, then you just use your
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you will recuperate from here is,
is quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be for more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is nice and open.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess you just pull out the plug that
the bowl is going into and dip in with a
[SPEAKER_04]: little dab to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally on our other units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our units, like this one here,
you actually, we actually have like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have one of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like one of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hook you up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your oil actually accumulates here and you
can redab your oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I'm saying, if you're using only
herbs, no ash, nothing, just herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the, the resin rosin that you'll
get out of there, the extraction,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reef, the re, uh, the re condensation
of the fragmentation, the fraction that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing here is, uh, is delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go as far as saying it's even
ridiculously medicinal because it is the
[SPEAKER_04]: very thing that I used to remove a big
nasty mole on my neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two applications, five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It fell off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: This mole dried up like a raisin and fell
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the reclaim out of my sublimator,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've told the story like 10 times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a true story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say fell off, like with
surgical precision, there's no,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I took off the bandaid and I was
like, Whoa, where is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I looked in the bandaid and it
was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mole that was on my neck five days
prior with that, uh, reclaim.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but I was mostly hitting herb and
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a concentrated version of those
two you know, resins just building up in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just never have the chance like you
to have like quality hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just like with herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got good hooks for good herbs,
but the ash is just the way out of my,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do, you got to be professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a hash making machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your second one yet,
Johnny?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we going to do here,
Johnny is we're going to put a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of herb inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a double decker for you on
a little tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready, John?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just a little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, go my man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sublimator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kelly from neutral life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I literally haven't seen for 25 years,
20 years anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that back on, on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the waxy Bernie part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the first 10, the first like you're
hitting the King's hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I normally do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that normally market can speak very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why today you're asking me
question and I feel like I'm a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on the slow side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all getting sublimated up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you were talking about Kelly,
Kelly neutral life, my associate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 years in the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, uh, first hydroponic shop in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, uh, he's definitely goes way
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I first met him 25 plus years ago
through one of my mentors, Ron Hickey,
[SPEAKER_04]: who also owned a shop in Manitoba,
a couple of shops called nature's
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrition back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, uh, these guys are the old
school guys that have been doing this for
[SPEAKER_04]: a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pioneer in this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and blaze.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sublimator never denies you of an
extreme go a little harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to get you a real good
hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super tasty on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, uh, how many temperature notches did
you turn that down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no, I put it to six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, for this one, I put it to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, last one though, the first one that we
hit the first one was, uh, the thing is I
[SPEAKER_01]: first heated it with the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little bit, uh, a little bit
lost on where I should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what we should try right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a little too hot, Mark?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one was a little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was like full terpene deep in my
lungs, rocker of a hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm satiated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: John, you want to do a big one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast, hard and fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear it always affects you in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you puff, uh, instead of the way you
would the way someone requests that you
[SPEAKER_04]: puff, it's quite a nice, uh, sorry pace.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can just, you know, get out of your
comfort zone and go here and I'll puff
[SPEAKER_04]: like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I hit Horatio's LHO and he
was like, all right, I want you to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: real slow long hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll take about 20, 25 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold it in for a few then exhale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never hit like that, but I did for him
and it, uh, it rocked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I'm telling you to breathe
a little faster is just because we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of mass and this thing is like,
uh, if you, if you don't cool it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sublimator works a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much hot mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put your a hundred milligrams,
a gram of organic, if you don't cool it
[SPEAKER_01]: off with air, yeah, this is sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to throw a little bit more art,
uh, breathe a little more harder to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through the atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you make it go to the atomizer at
the certain, at the proper PSI,
[SPEAKER_01]: will you have a better, uh, atomization of
your, uh, or fragmentation of your
[SPEAKER_01]: product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your product does have in common with
mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say you give yourself a nice one
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what I find it has in common with
bubble bags is that the users really are
[SPEAKER_04]: required to learn how to use the unit and
use it properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you don't, it doesn't give you
the same benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm always most stoked hitting
the sublimator with Enrico because he
[SPEAKER_04]: knows how to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you got it, you need about like two
or three minutes and then you got it for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like for the dab, it's not very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just put it at, uh, it's just with the
herb, with the herb, depending if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the dab master or this one, this one's a
little bit more massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thermodynamic is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to work at a lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how often will this turn off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just do this, uh, see,
he had a little, uh, normally,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, it doesn't, he doesn't even turn off
right now in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just because I broke that little knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you another knob right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally you have one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you just get a pass in front of
it, click, click, and you have another
[SPEAKER_01]: hour normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at any point in time, if you go click,
click, it extends it for an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's very good for me to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that I like my unit to be on all
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just have it on and whatever I want to
go to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, it happened a few times where I went to
my, the sublimator and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what the heck?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, it's a good safety
feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you remember the first unit?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, it was difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for interrupting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was difficult for us to keep a unit
that was functional like 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember two year warranty on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diode would not last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I ended up having to, uh,
to exchange a lot of unit at the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: because of these mistakes that I let
people leave it on 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sleep nine, 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just conveniently on for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one that is on at the house for
like nine months now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never went down really on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, I, I shut mine off at night,
but I do tend to leave them on like in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day for, but now that I know, that that's
really convenient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I can just hit that every 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right sitting right there on my
computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's not like it's far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's literally right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we see it is if you forget to
reset your button for an hour,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably time to stop smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: My man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll remember for the first six hours,
just around the seventh or eighth hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might start forgetting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quite a nice little rip on that
pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me show you something else now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got this pipe here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we're going to take this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, where did I put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put it on the stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put in a stand like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we didn't show people also the,
uh, we should have shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have all you have for dabs is,
uh, we have some hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the LHL LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should try a dab of LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here before we try the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I try it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please show us how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dry set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dippage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a very good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just like pushing itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see, when you do the dabs,
yes, some low temp action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, monster dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's really going to hit you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the LHL.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the L to the H to the O.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the D carb THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just took a pretty huge rip of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that
[SPEAKER_04]: was a medium sized rip and it was a head
rocker.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took a great hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, the LHL has a kick.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say guys, I mean, uh,
LHL, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that hit you hard?
[SPEAKER_04]: Distill it, distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he, he did it all up through a rotavap
and basically got a very small percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: of the pure, pure pureness out of it and
less left everything else in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, you know, he lost quite a bit
of material in that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is decarboxylated, totally active.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could rub it on your skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already active before we heat it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely, uh, how you finish the
session with the LHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a session to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you didn't try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did try.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't try a double decker of LHL,
did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just a one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have urban there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but we should try a double decker of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want, let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put some Congo in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget locally.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can come here and see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come see us and get the unit
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Johnny, look what I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spoke that already.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love the smell on that Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much like, uh, your Medi lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smelled that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I have three types of Congo at
the house and they all smell different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different growers, all different
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one of them is the best weed I
ever smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is more the, the, um,
who grew the best weed you ever smoked in
[SPEAKER_01]: your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot say without, without,
uh, because I haven't smoked weed with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with, uh, so many, many people,
but so far GS is the one that I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got the best tasty weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's GS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we have a dab ready for this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, as an L H O dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this for John?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The double decker.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just what I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you needed that apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't mind, I'm going to put
this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty little harder than normal and you'd
be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one more run here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take her Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to smoke myself into a coma.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer the King's hit as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that first little boom,
boom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you dab the oil and you expand
the oil, you make it go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: process and lay it over the bed of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a, it makes it last much
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a different type of feeling
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get hit by two places, get the
fracking of the weed and your oil on tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm drunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I rarely hit more than one in a row
and I'm good to go for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to get yourself ripped,
puffing two or three of those in a row is
[SPEAKER_04]: a good way to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're welcome to hit more if you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to do now is I'm going to
wait for this to get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do a torch torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you do it right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many many's the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very small torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's nice that it was in the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just seen where you were like heating it
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is like you can eat for a
longer time, just the head till your
[SPEAKER_01]: atomizer gets hot or you can heat up the
torch and your atomizer at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until they both hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's at good temperature,
it does that in bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like that one little 10,
that 10 mil highly educated bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the hive ceramic bowl because
you're supposed to kind of heat it in a
[SPEAKER_04]: nice, even way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just found every time I put the
torch near the top of the hole,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would go and blow out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously I never really got to use the
unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried about holding the torch in
one spot and breaking the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like this one doesn't seem like the
best glass piece to torch with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a pretty fancy one for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all these different arms coming off
of it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosted on the bottom too with your logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound blasted in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should be ready to try
something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, show us what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would do is I would put this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we then?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the camping version.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that was not hot enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, tasty though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's like a really low dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, I still felt it in the
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but if I would have just,
uh, eat it up just a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Johnny will show us how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My torch, like I said, is a very small
torch and it's really for smaller titanium
[SPEAKER_04]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm realizing this as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have, oh, I didn't even give you
the right, uh, weeding anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you touch weed instead of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had a great hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B's up for the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't forget about Johnny B on a Puff
Wednesday and we are definitely puffing on
[SPEAKER_04]: Puff Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've puffed, well, we've puffed at John's
and we've puffed next to the lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've puffed here in the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Cactus Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Cactus Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've puffed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a good Puff Wednesday so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, sublimating both with the,
uh, plug-in version and the camper
[SPEAKER_04]: version, the torch version.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also liked that one you had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you have one for like putting in
the fire?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, uh, we used it, uh, the campground
version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had one that you could put in the
coals of the fire and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, man, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The campfire version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny always puts the same amount in,
just the perfect amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows exactly how much earth to put in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these are the difficult variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you find are hard to share with the
audience or your customer base when
[SPEAKER_04]: they're, is it difficult to get across to
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how much herb you need to put in or
is it just showing them a video?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, normally I just, I show them the
video, but normally we try to go a 0.1,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a 10th of a gram, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm ready to enjoy my sublimated
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always high as fuck after hanging out with
Enrico, one bowl after another.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I'm at the cannabis cup right
now and we're like 20 people in a row,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's just really me and John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to make you one of these
so you can try it directly from the.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he's going to get in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just get in line for your head and we
have to remember Enrico every once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while and give him one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a, uh, what's, what's good with this
unit is actually, if you don't have dabs,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't have, if you only have dry
sift with you or some ash or some herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you can actually just use that
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a little tent of a gram,
you put that bad boy right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you put this here and then you're good to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that being the titanium is so much
more lighter now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kisses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's beautiful about this now is I
kept a piece of ash from earlier and
[SPEAKER_01]: without reheating it up right now,
I can just go ahead and dab it up.
Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you, I could just turn three shades
of red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, definite improvements.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to fucking trying out
all these toys for certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'll be able to try them for a bit
as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can check all this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sublimator sublimator.ca sublimator
.ca on our, uh, also they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: find them wherever you tell them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get your, uh, code code.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real important to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to have access to all this
beautiful material for much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, definitely stoked on, on that unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a level of high that is,
uh, well, it's no wonder why people are
[SPEAKER_04]: always so busy at the events, uh,
waiting in line at your booth to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's getting, it's getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, yeah, we're, we're very happy.

years we've come along.
