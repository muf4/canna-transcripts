[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Hash Church episode two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Hash Church 2.0 episode 19.
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally thought it was like episode 16
and then 17 and then 18.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you probably noticed I changed the
title quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fingers crossed that it works today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fingers crossed that I can hear the people
that get invited in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to send out the link right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to copy that link again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope everyone's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed there were some people waiting
in the chat room for Hash Church to start,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is always great.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's there's actually three
different places I have to go to send
[SPEAKER_06]: these links out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fingers crossed that when people come
in, I can actually hear them because I
[SPEAKER_06]: miss all you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss our Saturday conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always a big fan of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Scunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_10]: Howdy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Howdy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you have Chimera with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, Mr. Scunkman?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have pretty fast Internet right now,
so I'm not sure what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we get some other folks in
here and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry that I'm lagging.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just heard from Forrest.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just sent me an email saying he's
unfortunately not going to be able to make
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're having a small gathering for
Silas's birthday today and got a list of
[SPEAKER_06]: chores to get through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should send Silas a happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, Wade?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was having a little bit of problem
with my audio with Scunkman.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it was delayed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be his computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hear me fine?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hearing you fine this time around,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, great, great, great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can hear you, Sam, or I can.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam's a little bit cutting out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he might need to restart his
computer or something, but we'll see what
[SPEAKER_06]: happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a nice slow start to church
today, but the bottom line is there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of us in here and that's all we
need to start a conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wished Silas a happy birthday,
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it was his birthday today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, 12 years old now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: His parents were told they shouldn't
expect him to make it to 10, so we're
[SPEAKER_12]: thrilled.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss Forrest and Silas and the whole
crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time since we've had them
on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Mike West.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's got his farmer's gear on.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in farmer mode, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hanging out, hanging out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little hash church, and I like how you
guys are huddled around the hash church
[SPEAKER_06]: phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to hear.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm having trouble hearing those guys,
so I'm going to restart.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be back in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try Chrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chrome is what I'm having my best luck on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was having bad luck with Safari,
not being able to hear what people were
[SPEAKER_06]: saying, so I guess Wade was having that
problem with you guys, but I can hear you
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfectly perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunkman Sam just went and reset his shit
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having mild technical difficulties,
but hopefully you guys have a bong
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere nearby and you're doing bong
rips of the full melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it working now, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got slow going today here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder how many people there are in this
room.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a small group in here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We said, I think Wendy and Colton Turner
said they were going to pop in later,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Etienne fortunately was unable to make
it, but there were some other yeses that I
[SPEAKER_06]: got.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure, that made me feel like,
yeah, we should do a hash church today,
[SPEAKER_06]: so we'll just throw it around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything going good with you guys?
[SPEAKER_15]: Going good, going good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just setting up this facility,
and we'll talk more about that facility a
[SPEAKER_15]: little bit later, but setting it up to do
some research this year, and it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_15]: impressive facility, so it's kind of
working through all the kinks,
[SPEAKER_15]: getting everything running, and then back
online.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a testament to how well thought out
it was that I could start up after another
[SPEAKER_19]: 10 years of sitting, so that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they got the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine said they were
having a hard time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't getting the link,
and for whatever reason, it's not letting
[SPEAKER_06]: me send the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having mild computer technology
problems here as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's turning it off and on again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they said they got the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the email that I sent out
probably showed up a little late,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so now they're going to come in here
soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to be so nervous about starting
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd get so, not aggressive, but just kind
of like, I would just want it to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just want Hash Church to work,
and now I'm so relaxed and chill about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on, Colin?
[SPEAKER_16]: What up, guys?
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm on my phone today.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm having issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, put that shit down on a table so it
doesn't move, and you'll be laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike and Johnny are also on the phone.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm actually going to go outside.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got to get some headsets going.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you all doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little bit of a slow start trying
to get the links out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not always easy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, not at all.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we managed to get it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to get my rig, and I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to put myself on pause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is so strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've now frozen my messenger with Josh and
Kelly, and I can't send them any message.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they said they just got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be here in two seconds, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't even let me force quit on
messenger.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is my microphone working right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but I can't hear your turntable.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is my microphone working?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, are your speakers working is another
question because we're answering yes every
[SPEAKER_06]: time you ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B got the death.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent the link to a bunch of people,
but I think we should start with a bong
[SPEAKER_06]: rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: What better way to start Hash Church than
with a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, everyone in the congregation,
get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam's having problems, technical problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have a little dab a doodle here.
[SPEAKER_09]: My speakers are working.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're cutting out a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your shit is not on point right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turning me up into headphones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn me up into headphones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that scene from Dave Chappelle
show?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Dylan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spit mad fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing he'd probably know he was the
one that said it in chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wendy Turner said she's running a little
late and she'll show up as soon as
[SPEAKER_06]: possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's good time for a bong rip
for those of you that can do bong rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on over there in
middle America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you pulling bong rips out of his ear?
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like you just pulled a bong rip
right out of his ear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys puffing on that wax?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are muted, so I don't hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin's muted as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're having issues with our headset
or earbuds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's just another ridiculous day on
hash charts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope that it works out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope that we get everyone working
with their microphones and their speakers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be nice to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you okay, Sam, but you're cutting
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's when other people
talk or if it's because we don't have our
[SPEAKER_06]: microphones muted or what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can definitely hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to go get some water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to go get some water?
[SPEAKER_17]: I will.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I got to get some water in two
different situations.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is what I'm all about
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this shit out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Measuring this temperature of my banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that great?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little temperature gauge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I am so loving my Temptac USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I bring it up, someone's like,
why don't you just use a $10 thermometer
[SPEAKER_06]: gun?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't know, because you got to
hold that in your hand and it's ghetto.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sits right under my banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm watching it go from 700 degrees down
to 694.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right around 680 is when I'll hit it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark, those are 3D printed, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe they're 3D printed.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm sure that's going to end up
being a souvenir because eventually once
[SPEAKER_15]: they...
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually, when you're prototyping stuff,
you'll 3D print it and then once you get
[SPEAKER_15]: the prototype worked out, actually get it
injection molded to shape it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, when they actually start doing
the molds for them, they can start making
[SPEAKER_15]: them out of hemp plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: How fucking cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pretty cool guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking to them and I definitely
am an unapologetic gadget geek.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever just said that.
[SPEAKER_06]: PK Brewer, it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the gadgets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaning down and my shirt made it look
like it was one of the boxes in the chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, who's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks familiar.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Legends of Hash shirt from
Barcelona this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can check it out, the Lebanese hash
makers going to town there.
[SPEAKER_19]: That must have been a good dance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have part Scottish in me,
bubble man?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan Rohan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little bit of Irish and a little
bit of Scottish in me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes when I'm doing the... Oh,
listen to you, Mr. Fucking birds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can turn it off, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't turn the birds off, bro.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you guys turn it down back there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the bird whisperer.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the bird whisperer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Colin's out on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are in like middle America.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over on the West Coast and Sam's way
over across the Atlantic Ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we got going on right now.
Dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: your cat must be tripping on those birds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming through so clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go on mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like he's got a high-end
microphone or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's pulled out one of his studio mics and
he's recording birds from a kilometer
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did a little wake and bake yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's going on there, Dragonfly
Earth Medicine?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys in the room or is it sketching?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting the work done here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are kind of a little blurry and a
little dark, but it's great to see your
[SPEAKER_06]: silhouette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it gets changed here soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a little light, but nice to see you
all this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a nice slow start to church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly we've been technical difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eating our mics and the longer we take
that we don't do a church, the more it's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of like rusty when you get in the
room.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did a little wake and bake yesterday
just before church just to suss out the
[SPEAKER_06]: vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I smashed an hour on my wake and bake
just by myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I figured if we can't, there's so much
to talk about right now because if you
[SPEAKER_06]: haven't noticed, Hash Church was a pretty
big sort of place for us to talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: these important situations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with Hash Church not really around,
there's not really another spot like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's spots like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many spots like it, but there's
no real spot like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought we kind of owe it to the
community and ourselves to A, get together
[SPEAKER_06]: and shoot the shit, see how everyone's
doing, maybe mute Sam while he fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: coughs in my ear for the 15th time in a
row.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just joking, Sam, but I did mute
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously we're going to get into some
things here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely want to talk about Philos.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had a chance to talk to Mowgli
and invite him in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Kevin McKernan, who has been
one of the big oppositions online,
[SPEAKER_06]: is also unable to come in because he's
having a barbecue.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'd be kind of cool to have a little
conversation about that, but also a
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation about all these different
things that are going on in Canada and in
[SPEAKER_06]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: and the farm bill and all these different
things that are occurring in Colombia and
[SPEAKER_06]: the Caribbean and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot going on in the industry
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just feel that when we're not able
to gather, we don't, that information kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of doesn't really get, you know,
put into, yeah, discussed and put into a
[SPEAKER_06]: really...
[SPEAKER_19]: Got to get refreshed in the mind and let
those neurons connect and ideas get
[SPEAKER_19]: flowing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And obviously Hatchurch has always been a
great gathering of the minds.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't matter what you do in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great place where we can all kind
of gather around the campfire and talk
[SPEAKER_15]: about things as they pop up.
[SPEAKER_15]: So obviously we're open invitation to
Mowgli, open invitation to Kevin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's try and get them on and actually
hash this out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can certainly talk about a little
bit of that controversy because there's a
[SPEAKER_15]: lot of stuff that's kind of popped up over
the last month.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's all things that growers and
breeders and industry folk need to kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: understand.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the intellectual property rights
of cannabis, as much as we want to keep
[SPEAKER_15]: this in a fair and open community,
we have to be able to protect growers.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to be able to protect the
breeders.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to, first and foremost,
we have to be able to protect the
[SPEAKER_15]: patients.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have my personal thoughts on it,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, you know, being a medical patient...
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to see the patients have safe
access no matter where they are.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same end, obviously,
you know, growers, breeders, genetics
[SPEAKER_15]: companies, anybody starts spending,
you know, lots of time, money,
[SPEAKER_15]: resources, developing IP, whether that be
genetics or processes or potentially
[SPEAKER_15]: developing patents.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we as industry leaders have to
be able to set the example that way,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, when as Wall Street or the
public companies kind of form,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we set that good example.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, the best example is some of
the predatory patents out there for
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of those cannabis cultivar patents
are fairly broad, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_15]: have to get, you know, fought in court.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, when you look at the
transition from black market, gray market
[SPEAKER_15]: to regulated markets, there's a big
learning curve that has to go through.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, the USPTO doesn't go to the
black market to research potential
[SPEAKER_15]: patents.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, we have to be able to set
the example.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, for patents, you know,
the governments that issue those patents
[SPEAKER_15]: make just as much money when the patents
get challenged as they do when the patents
[SPEAKER_15]: get issued.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we've kind of seen come up is,
you know, a couple of different
[SPEAKER_15]: intellectual property developments in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both genetics as well as technologies.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have to be able to not only develop
that IP, protect that IP, but also be able
[SPEAKER_15]: to provide that IP to the public.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's, I was a cannabis refugee
15 years ago, moving to a state that,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, because I needed CBD in my life
in Texas, 15 years ago, there wasn't CBD
[SPEAKER_15]: available.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, a ton of things.
[SPEAKER_15]: A ton of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gonna be an interesting year.
[SPEAKER_15]: West Coast, it looks like weather report,
going to the farmers' almanac.
[SPEAKER_15]: West Coast is gonna have a fairly
phenomenal year, but a little bit dry.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there it's gonna be some forest fires
kind of pop up on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of where we're at, Central America in
the Midwest, it's actually a fairly wet
[SPEAKER_15]: spring.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of the farmers we've been talking to
are, you know, when you apply for crop
[SPEAKER_15]: insurance, cannabis aside, cannabis can't
have crop insurance yet, but there are
[SPEAKER_15]: some federal bills that would include crop
insurance for industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the Midwest, you know, we've had a
fairly wet spring.
[SPEAKER_15]: And all the corn farmers, you know,
normally in order to have crop insurance
[SPEAKER_15]: for growing corn, you have to be able to,
you know, plant it in the ground before
[SPEAKER_15]: Memorial Day.
[SPEAKER_15]: That way there's a hundred days of
sunlight for your crop to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's corn.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we're kind of seeing in the
Mississippi River area of the Midwest of
[SPEAKER_15]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: is, you know, that hundred day mark is
Memorial Day, which is today and tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of corn farmers, because this,
you know, a fairly wet spring,
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of the farmers haven't yet planted
their crops, hundred day crops.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're starting to see some talk about,
okay, well, rather than growing corn,
[SPEAKER_15]: they're gonna potentially have to grow
soybeans because soybeans have slightly
[SPEAKER_15]: shorter growing cycles.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, the current trade wars with
Asia is kind of causing issues with
[SPEAKER_15]: tariffs as well as value of soybeans.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it'd be great if, you know,
farmers in the Midwest had a, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: 50 to 70 day crop that they could plant
instead of corn, grow it hopefully more
[SPEAKER_15]: sustainably and still be able to pull off
a harvest this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause it looks like knock on wood.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, and then when we're starting
to see that happen in a lot of states,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, industrial hemp is kind of
slowly making its progress across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's four states that don't
have industrial hemp or cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the vast majority of Americans as well
as people in North America are in
[SPEAKER_15]: jurisdictions where they can cultivate
either medical marijuana, medical
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis, industrial hemp, or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to know what, how, Josh and
Kelly, how's it up in the, up in where
[SPEAKER_15]: you, you're part of the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: How's your spring been?
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw some pictures of you guys
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we just probably about two and a
half, maybe two weeks ago, we just got
[SPEAKER_01]: done with some super cold evenings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So had a really hard frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like spring went from really,
really cold, super hard, frost to really
[SPEAKER_01]: hot to like almost like 30 degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had to transplant all of our
starts over and over again, not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily with our cannabis at all,
but like our chard and our beets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't really like that super hot
temperatures, our brassicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to replant twice, but everything's
coming up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're feeling like a true spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really dry actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's wet right now, like right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it just rained the last couple of
days, which is sweet, but it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I unbelievably so to where you walk around
in the forest and it's really pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: brittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, you know, that was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been good for the, the ganja starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of seeds started on April
20th, 420, and they're coming up really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice, really beautiful right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our soils are totally prepped.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our greenhouses are totally prepped
and we're really excited for the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we got auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of hemp, a bunch of
cultivars that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing in Canada, but have been,
you know, have come from wherever they've
[SPEAKER_02]: come from to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to try that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to test whether they
finish up here in British Columbia because
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the hemp strains haven't finished
all of the auto, the auto one,
[SPEAKER_02]: the auto two, the cherry wine,
the box, the spectrum, all of those really
[SPEAKER_02]: really didn't finish good in our area and
couldn't, couldn't be in the field right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're feeling really blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got like a really long breeding
project, maybe like a 40 year breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project from heart rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys gave us some auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be able to do some
crossing and really our, our big goal this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, probably the next five
years is coming out with a super high CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp strain that finishes up here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really, really focused on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what we're going to be
working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's also, you know,
something we're working on as a collective
[SPEAKER_02]: and as a pure certified group.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us farmers, we're doing a
breeding project together and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're interested in genetics and
public domain and what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what are the rights within
public domain?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what, what rights are we giving up
and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's something we're
really exploring and we're talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: people inside the cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking to people outside the
cannabis realm that are in the food realms
[SPEAKER_02]: because food has been hijacked,
you know, long ago, you know, in ways that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis might be just facing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of, part of legalization
that we really always feared was really
[SPEAKER_02]: this right now was the, you know,
the federal takeover and what,
[SPEAKER_02]: what large agriculture does with crops is
something that, you know, we really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to see in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's putting a huge challenge to us
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and we are excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not excited, but you know,
we are excited, but interested in just
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, you know, I, I personally,
I've been a really long time friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mowgli and Mowgli's, you know,
family is good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a personal relationship there
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally want to thank Philos
right now for opening up our eyes to a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things, a lot of people in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have been asleep and they haven't
recognized that we needed to protect this
[SPEAKER_01]: IP or that we needed to share these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're like Josh said,
we're really into public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're reaching out to every single expert
that we know of anybody that can mentor
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really like sparked a fire under our
booties at this time to really get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we came up with was that we're
going to be putting it in the public
[SPEAKER_01]: domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already starting a breeding project
with 40 plus farms and the pure
[SPEAKER_01]: certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole bunch of data that
people can collect that we keep within
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that actualizes your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the thing that we worry about
patenting and marketing and marketing and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these things in the cannabis plant is
she's an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole lot of money in corporate
cannabis and people that are dumping into
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of patenting idea in cannabis,
but she's an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could take a patent seed and somebody
could spend two million dollars on
[SPEAKER_01]: patenting that seed and get all of the
rights and everything to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could put it in my deep,
beautiful living soil beds for four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you wouldn't even recognize it because
she's an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just, you know, I guess we're kind
of putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't, wouldn't cannabis already have
been genetically modified back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: thirties or the forties when they made the
crossover from hemp to cotton or from hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: to something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is someone's thought on that?
[SPEAKER_15]: What maybe it's not genetically modified,
but not genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hasn't been successful enough or
what?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's dating back thousands of years
just due to Mendelian breeding.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cannabis has been bred from a dioecious
plant, which the industry will call from
[SPEAKER_15]: Aphroditic into monaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was all based on selective
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's selection.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's selection and for genetic
modification, but it's not genetic
[SPEAKER_15]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not actually creating genetically
modified organism GMO, but just due to
[SPEAKER_15]: Mendelian genetics, the simple act of
doing a analytical test to select for CBD
[SPEAKER_15]: and then taking the CBD cultivars to
incorporate into your breeding pollen is a
[SPEAKER_15]: form of genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I personally am a big fan of my,
my educational backgrounds on molecular
[SPEAKER_15]: biogenetics.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, before getting into the
industry, I was looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: developing biofuels for use and because,
you know, biofuels are far more
[SPEAKER_15]: sustainable than the other sources of
energy.
[SPEAKER_15]: But ultimately, you know, we don't want to
fold the wool over our eyes and say that
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis is the same cannabis that was
around, you know, 10,000, 50,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And years ago, you know, we have numerous
different land races that locally adapted
[SPEAKER_15]: to their growing regions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the simple act of taking those,
you know, genetics from one part of the
[SPEAKER_15]: world to another part of the world,
cultivating them for successive
[SPEAKER_15]: generations, you're going to get
adaptation of that, those hybrids or those
[SPEAKER_15]: cultivars to your bio region.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, that's a form of, you know,
selecting for cultivars and Mendelian
[SPEAKER_15]: genetic selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the case for all plants on
earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, you know, that's the case
for walnut trees and everything is in
[SPEAKER_02]: constant evolution.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, now there's a big difference
between, you know, I, I could go in depth
[SPEAKER_15]: into, you know, the concerns that I have
about genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_15]: The last thing we want to do is to start,
you know, inserting genetic, inserting
[SPEAKER_15]: gene sequences into cannabis cultivars
that make them, you know, produce
[SPEAKER_15]: antifreeze or produce pesticide resistance
or produce, there's even ways that you can
[SPEAKER_15]: make them phosphofluorescent.
[SPEAKER_15]: So glow in black lights or glow in lights.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could grow, you could genetically
engineer it, inserting rose thorns.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have rose thorns.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's even a genetic selection that's
going on for actually hybridizing
[SPEAKER_15]: different traits into, from non-cannabis
varieties into cannabis varieties.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are, those genetic engineering
where you're taking non-cannabis genetics
[SPEAKER_15]: and putting them into cannabis potentially
have side effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know, you know, with big cases in
corn, you know, they've not only create
[SPEAKER_15]: pesticide resistance so that they can
spray really bad pesticides onto corn
[SPEAKER_15]: fields.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really bad for the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, they've genetically
modified, genetically engineered corn so
[SPEAKER_15]: that it can resist that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I think that is a travesty to the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_15]: And part of, you know, starting this new
industry, we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_15]: promote, you know, avoiding that sort of
thing by developing sustainable
[SPEAKER_19]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would you grow, why would you
genetically modify it to be resistant to a
[SPEAKER_19]: pesticide instead of genetically modify it
to be resistant against the bugs in the
[SPEAKER_15]: first place?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So being able to select for cultivars that
grow well in your bio region, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: the strains that grow well in Florida,
are going to be, you know, more equatorial
[SPEAKER_15]: sativas with narrow leaves versus the ones
that grow well in the mountain areas or in
[SPEAKER_15]: different Appalachias.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm a big fan of being able to,
you know, incorporate a sustainable
[SPEAKER_15]: ecosystem because every bad thing in our,
that could potentially affect our crop has
[SPEAKER_15]: a natural predator.
[SPEAKER_15]: The last thing we want to do is start
inserting genetics into cannabis that
[SPEAKER_15]: could potentially have adverse side
effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: A good example, I've seen frost resistant
genetic engineering where they're taking
[SPEAKER_15]: genes that produce antifreeze and Arctic
fish and putting those into plant
[SPEAKER_15]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about feminized seed then?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on that note, you know,
all the farmers using feminized seed on a
[SPEAKER_02]: large scale in hemp agriculture,
does that raise a flag to you?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I, you know, I don't consider myself a
breeder by any means, but you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: there are, for every tool there's a use,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm going to plant several hundred or
several thousand acres, the farmers that
[SPEAKER_15]: are growing hundreds or thousands of acres
don't have the time or money or resources
[SPEAKER_15]: to be able to go through those and select
for the dioecious or hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_15]: plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in some cases we need those,
you know, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: But as a home grower, you're probably not
going to find me cultivating feminized
[SPEAKER_15]: seeds because the male plants are the
basis of breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: So being able to select for, you know,
good females, good males, doing that
[SPEAKER_15]: hybridization.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then in the case of feminized seeds,
you know, the commercial breeders can then
[SPEAKER_15]: develop feminized seed, release them en
masse to farmers, and hopefully have any
[SPEAKER_15]: given farmer will grow a few cultivars
interplanted.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a good way to be able to create a
farm that not only has, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: industrial hemp that's primarily feminized
with a lower risk of cross-pollination,
[SPEAKER_15]: but then, you know, the farmer can spend
his time doing other things like,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, trying to interplant,
trying to get cover crops going between
[SPEAKER_15]: the hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think there's pros and cons with
everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot of people hate on strains that
produce hermaphroditic traits,
[SPEAKER_15]: but that's really just the plant doing
what it evolved to do thousands of years
[SPEAKER_15]: ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you won't see me growing feminized
plants, but, you know, I may use,
[SPEAKER_15]: incorporate feminized plants into some of
the breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the bigger concern is when I
see people selling feminized seed and part
[SPEAKER_15]: of the material transfer agreements
include that you're not allowed to replant
[SPEAKER_15]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not allowed to hybridize them.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not allowed to collect the seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are, you know, fairly large,
well-known seed distributors that aren't
[SPEAKER_15]: allowing breeders to breed with their
stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which isn't that cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because, you know, in many cases,
they're incorporating genetics that they
[SPEAKER_15]: acquired on the open market.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And doing the work, be able to hybridize
and stabilize those strains.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then preventing other people from
hybridizing and stabilizing those strains.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's pros and cons, but what we want
to be able to do is, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: we understand that there is a ton of money
and ton of work incorporated into
[SPEAKER_15]: developing new lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want those breeders to be able to
protect those lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, we don't want that
to, you know, cannonball to a point where,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, just because I'm doing work on
genetics for my farm doesn't mean that,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, if that seed or pollen gets out
into other people's farm, then you have
[SPEAKER_15]: potential litigation where, you know,
a dude down the street or over the hill
[SPEAKER_15]: accidentally got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've actually seen Monsanto Bayer do
that, where the BT-resistant
[SPEAKER_15]: pesticide-resistant corn got
cross-pollinated just due to corn being an
[SPEAKER_15]: aerial pollination species.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, you know, those large companies
going after the companies.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I, you know, I have mixed feeling about
what some of the genetics companies have
[SPEAKER_15]: done.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a big fan of being able to do genetic
testing because I think that that's going
[SPEAKER_15]: to start developing intellectual property
rights for the breeders.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the same hand, we want to be able
to have the open transparency.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's a huge conflict of
interest for if I was running a testing
[SPEAKER_15]: lab and all of a sudden I opened up a
extraction lab or a farm, there's a
[SPEAKER_15]: potential conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the same as if you're doing a genetic
testing lab and then start opening up a
[SPEAKER_15]: genetic distribution company.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that any, once you commit to
doing that genetic testing lab,
[SPEAKER_15]: you have to kind of keep that in your,
as your wheelhouse because then you're
[SPEAKER_15]: going to be the one that's developing,
helping to develop intellectual property
[SPEAKER_15]: rights for those breeders.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've spent tens of thousands of
dollars through companies on doing genetic
[SPEAKER_15]: research, getting stuff sequenced,
searching for rare phenotypes in the
[SPEAKER_15]: genetic sequence.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a concern of mine that,
you know, some of those genetics,
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that any of those genetics
were stolen, but I do think that some of
[SPEAKER_15]: that data should be available in the
public art and as well as should be,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, proprietary.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if I find a end-all, be-all
genetic mutation that produces entirely
[SPEAKER_15]: CBDV or CBGV or some of the other rarest
nabinoids, obviously we want to protect
[SPEAKER_15]: those, develop those, and then as part of,
you know, raising money to become a
[SPEAKER_15]: business, being able to sell them.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the last thing I want to see is,
you know, people like Colton not being
[SPEAKER_15]: able to have access to people like myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I was, I left Texas to be
able to move to Colorado 15 years ago just
[SPEAKER_15]: so I could have access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I consider it a travesty that we have
almost a hundred years of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_15]: preventing stuff from going, you know,
being available.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of great
points there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Feminine seed to, to, to cull that many
plants on an acre, per acre basis,
[SPEAKER_17]: is a tremendous amount of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to be able to start non-feminine seed
takes a lot, tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_17]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you're a farmer, you don't have a
tremendous amount of infrastructure always
[SPEAKER_17]: set aside for individual crops.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a maybe, mainly a catch-all.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's, it's extremely difficult when you
get into large acreage to be able to
[SPEAKER_17]: manage that.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something I've had to deal with.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something that I'm continuing to have
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's large acreage to you,
just for the listeners?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Large acres is, is over, over 40,
40 acres.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's large.
[SPEAKER_17]: That starts to become something that is,
requires management in a, in a much larger
[SPEAKER_17]: scale than, than you can do individually.
[SPEAKER_17]: It requires equipment that's much larger
than yourself.
[SPEAKER_17]: It can be done by humans, but it's,
it's the term tremendous amount of work.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's, you know, 40 acres and up all
the way up to a thousand, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_17]: thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_12]: So- Of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_17]: Of hemp.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, cannabis is too valuable.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just think it's, it's really hard to
manage that when you're, when you're
[SPEAKER_17]: culling things and it requires such
infrastructure to start your, your,
[SPEAKER_17]: your progeny, your genetics so early to be
able to select for that and then put them
[SPEAKER_17]: out at the right time so they actually
don't get too big.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or, and then there's the management of
them, of the canopy in itself.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's why in the East coast,
we don't plant until the second,
[SPEAKER_17]: first, second week of June, because our
plants just get too big.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't manage it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's, that's something I see
firsthand.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and, you know, as we learn about
this, I always consider cannabis to be an
[SPEAKER_17]: ornamental that we're attempting to
industrialize.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a lot of things that we have
to understand.
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we can attempt to start,
like you said before, start taking away
[SPEAKER_17]: things from the gene pool or adding things
to the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are, those are major concerns.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to, to bring it back into the
phyloscope, you know, I, I've worked with
[SPEAKER_17]: phylos personally and, and, and like
yourself, Kelly, I, I really am fond of,
[SPEAKER_17]: of the people over there and what they
were, they've opened my eyes up to.
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a very scary thing to me.
[SPEAKER_17]: What is happening amongst the,
the industry and, and, and the world at
[SPEAKER_17]: large in terms of genetics.
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I do think that there's several
ways that we can attempt to protect
[SPEAKER_17]: ourselves and protect the legacies that
have gone before us.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the preservation aspect is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're all just trying to make sense of
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, and not many people truly
understand what is actually true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I just wanted to, yeah,
I just wanted to just say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: although, you know, Magli has been a good
friend of mine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I didn't say is that what happened
and the rock, you know, and the shaking
[SPEAKER_01]: that it did within the industry,
you know, is absolutely not okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was deceiving and it wasn't what
they started out as.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a way to move forward and
it's not a way to build trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're thankful because it's
like, yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corporations are here and it's for real
and you can lose some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing Beth?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to just to continue that
I worked with them, submitted 24 samples
[SPEAKER_17]: of my own personal work.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was not on the pretense that they were
going to open up their own program.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my heart dropped when I got the call.
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew about that six months before they
did the announcement and my, my heart was
[SPEAKER_17]: broken.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this is something that I've done
since I was 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_17]: You take away a license, you take away
this whole industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: I still do this.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's, it's something that deeply
profoundly hurt me on a, on a deeper level
[SPEAKER_17]: than just in a business move.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to point that out that
it's, it's, it isn't okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how we move forward.
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, I'm trying to make sense of
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to be really open to that.
[SPEAKER_17]: If Magli and the team's listening,
Alicia, I would really like to figure out
[SPEAKER_17]: a way to understand more about what you
believe that you can do for us.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I really don't see it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I'd love for them to come on
the show, Marcus, if you can have that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really love a lot more transparency
to the, to the general community and not
[SPEAKER_17]: saying that, you know, since all this has
happened, you haven't attempted to do all
[SPEAKER_17]: of that, but you've got to, we've got to
make, make this right somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost impossible to have a
conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even now, while we have this conversation,
there's people in the chat room who are
[SPEAKER_06]: claiming we're fully censoring everything
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, Oh, it's a big conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all a part of this conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, man, listen, like everyone
thought it was a great thing in the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe some things kind of bounced and
bumped.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that people are feeling a little,
you know, for me, I still acknowledge that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I hear a lot of what people are
upset about is not really possible or
[SPEAKER_06]: happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this made up Instagram thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not even based in reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, they're taking old material and
they're taking the genetics out and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're creating new plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no, they're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like at least get your shit right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to attack a company,
they did shady shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the shady shit they did,
but to just, just to create this other
[SPEAKER_06]: alternative reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't help the situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm down for having the conversation at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also down for welcoming Colton and
Colton and Wendy to the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Turners as the world Turners.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also to welcome Joshua in the room,
to welcome Johnny B into the room and to
[SPEAKER_06]: welcome Beth, who just rolled into the
room, who may know a lot more about this
[SPEAKER_06]: than maybe some of you think that you
know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know who wants to talk next.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk to all of you, but you
know, I maybe Beth, you might want to
[SPEAKER_06]: chime in and tell everyone who you are and
how you fit into this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I just want to say thank you so
much for having me this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the executive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you muted, Beth?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't hear you or I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear Beth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear Beth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone not hear Beth other than Josh
and Kelly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did everyone else hear Beth?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want for Josh and Kelly to hear
everything I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I hope that that that they
fix the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the executive director of the Open
Cannabis Project, which is closing on
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am I'm here to join the conversation
to support and answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like like Steve and I kind of talked
about yesterday, I think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, part of what has been I mean,
at this point, like, I think everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: knows the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: My story is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that now I think I'm in a
place of really being ready to well,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, make space for grieving and
processing and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, to make space for, you know,
really defining like, OK, if an ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary has been crossed, which it has,
then we need to define as a community what
[SPEAKER_00]: our ethics are so that we can better
define what it is that we stand for and
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thirdly, you know, I think that
I'm ready to just be in a place of moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and finding solutions and to do so
in a respectful manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this has been really I
missed the early part of the call.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I heard Kelly mention,
you know, that Mowgli is a friend and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowgli is a friend of mine, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like my heart hurts for my
friend and for our damaged friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, I want to see
amends made on all sides and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: find solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to talk about and I'm really
grateful to have the space and hear what
[SPEAKER_00]: people have to say and all of that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got a question for Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have had the honor of cultivating
Harlequin for a little bit over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, that was one of the strains
that not only saved my life, but saved
[SPEAKER_15]: multiple other children's lives around me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've done my best to try and spread
those CBD genetics to as many patients as
[SPEAKER_15]: possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: But obviously, we're starting to see some
of those genetics now getting incorporated
[SPEAKER_15]: into lines that are trying to be
protected.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, taking it back kind of we
obviously want to be able to have strains
[SPEAKER_15]: openly available.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, how do we develop lines,
make them publicly available not only to
[SPEAKER_15]: the patients, but to breeders to work with
and then obviously let's bring it back to
[SPEAKER_15]: Beth and see how can we not only,
you know, preserve genetics in the prior
[SPEAKER_15]: art, but also be able to develop those
genetics into potential, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: intellectual property for the companies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wish I had an answer.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the model of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it looks like the THCB was found
in the Harlequin as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can't hear anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone doesn't have their mic muted,
we won't hear Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's only going to come in clear if
everyone not talking has their microphone
[SPEAKER_06]: muted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, he's going to come in choppy
like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not hearing him at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, now he's stopped talking completely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll try and answer your question.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that idea that cannabis is
incredibly elastic and able to give us
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever we're looking for if we're
willing to go looking for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if you look at what happened with
Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you guys, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What just happened?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take a pause and I want to get
back to this conversation because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to hear from Wendy and Colton
as well, because we haven't heard from
[SPEAKER_06]: them in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wendy said she had some news she
wanted to share with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always like to hear from those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're just going to take a little
pause.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got lots more to talk about in
regards to Phylos.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's hear from the Turners.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is the world turning for the Turners?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now their microphones aren't working.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys hear them?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let me see if I can fix this somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today's been quite a lot of technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try now.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys might have to come back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we hear them when they first came
in?
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that if you're, I don't know if
you're on a Mac, but I have found that,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, reconnect and maybe try Chrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Google.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works best with Google chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, nobody's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to hear from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want them to, you know,
have to wait around for hours while we
[SPEAKER_06]: discuss Phylos, because we can go back and
have more of a discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to hear, you know, there's
people going off in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to hear about, you know,
obviously, Rob and Sam's, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: part in Phylos in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were two of the first people that
brought it to my attention for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we want to hear from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we hear you guys now.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate when this stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like the last time I basically
stopped doing hash church because I
[SPEAKER_06]: couldn't get my, I couldn't hear anyone,
but it's not just me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hearing it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we recycled our page and just refreshed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helped us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe someone else can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just refreshed your thing and you got
it going.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did you say Sam?
[SPEAKER_10]: I unplugged my microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll just, maybe if anyone can
hear us, I mean, I feel like it's large
[SPEAKER_02]: corporations act differently than the
common like person on the street,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it's not to say that
corporations are bad because a lot of us
[SPEAKER_02]: have corporations and we can do a lot of
good with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's even B corporate, you know,
B Corp and B corporations, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: really awesome and allow you to take,
you know, foundation money tax free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think with people like Phylos and
different companies and even other big
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution companies that are out there,
you just start getting investment and you
[SPEAKER_02]: start getting millions and hundreds of
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's nearly impossible for you to
keep an authentic, true, rightful vision
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have hundreds of millions of
dollars coming in because the energy just
[SPEAKER_02]: shifts and it takes it away from the
original mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what we're seeing on so
many fronts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here in Canada, you know,
farms are either having to join a large
[SPEAKER_02]: corporation or be incredibly savvy on
their own to be independent of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is a big part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're having discussions on,
you know, what we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier with acreage and how big can a
farm scale and still be regenerative?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes into the same notion of how
big can a corporation scale and still be
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can we create systems really
that are brand new to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've seen really small
businesses go to big massive corporations
[SPEAKER_01]: and how can we blend those so that people
are still having a say in it as well and
[SPEAKER_01]: that that the rules and the regulations
are for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that cannabis is really giving
us this new voice or this new idea to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how are we going to tackle these
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's opened our eyes to a lot of
different things and maybe some social
[SPEAKER_15]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll yeah, I'll introduce a term that
everyone should be using corporate social
[SPEAKER_15]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, as independent growers are
becoming companies and then they
[SPEAKER_15]: transition into publicly traded companies,
they have a responsibility to the
[SPEAKER_15]: shareholders.
[SPEAKER_15]: But part of that responsibility to the
shareholders can include corporate social
[SPEAKER_15]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: So since we are the people that are
everybody who's watching this,
[SPEAKER_15]: everybody who is on this call has work,
we're creating an industry and part of
[SPEAKER_15]: that industry, we have the opportunity to
create good corporate social
[SPEAKER_15]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that comes down to the decisions that
we make.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we cultivate using pesticides?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we cultivate regeneratively?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we do we extract using sustainable
methods or non sustainable methods?
[SPEAKER_15]: And while there's plenty of money to be
made, while the price of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_15]: artificially inflated due to regulation,
as we transitioned into a commodity crop,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a firm believer that a lot of the
people that are not cultivating
[SPEAKER_15]: sustainably aren't going to be able to
compete because, you know, we can produce
[SPEAKER_15]: acres as cheaply as you can home grow and
even cheaper.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can, you can, if you're cultivating
using cover crops, you don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_15]: for as many nutrients and that makes it
far more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, when it comes to developing
IP, companies that are developing
[SPEAKER_15]: intellectual property have, have a
responsibility to be able to make those
[SPEAKER_15]: products available to as many people as
possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what part of the reason why I've been,
I consider it such an honor to be that
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark and everyone has kind of popped on
the church, the church train is because
[SPEAKER_15]: we've been able to disseminate some of
this prior art to the public while at the
[SPEAKER_15]: same time, you know, promoting good
corporate social responsibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well put, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any, any word from Colton and Wendy's
microphone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we, is there any sound over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that hurts me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That hurts me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't even tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to hear from them so badly,
but it's just like not in the books.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're going to have to figure you
guys out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe turn that computer completely off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Restart the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do a restart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do a, like a turn off and a turn on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Josh, Josh, I think Josh is on this
call.
[SPEAKER_15]: Josh, why don't you talk about,
uh, this class you got coming up here next
[SPEAKER_15]: month and how people can learn how to
cultivate more sustainably.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_18]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: My battery died.
[SPEAKER_18]: Out in the farm, eh?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll see if I can, I can't unplug cause my
battery died, but I'm transplanting these
[SPEAKER_18]: clones, these seedlings.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was cool that, um, Sam is on because
I remember hearing on a hash church maybe
[SPEAKER_18]: about, about this time last year,
he was talking to Eric.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gem.
[SPEAKER_18]: About, uh, yes, this gem.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm using this tool.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, I'm behind and so I'm
transplanting into four inches so I can,
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, put these seedlings in the dark.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, for 24 hours and then bring them back
outside.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in two weeks down the road,
they'll show the sex.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I can call my mails from there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so pretty cool tech.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So usually you're talking about the
aquaponics course we're doing here in a
[SPEAKER_18]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Steve, excuse me, Steve and I,
I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never hosted people, um, on my farm.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm a little bit nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's kind of feels like I'm.
[SPEAKER_18]: Getting down into my underwear or
something and showing my, my really
[SPEAKER_18]: special spot, you know, it's just my,
my spot.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but I'm really excited and we're going
to basically just kind of share everything
[SPEAKER_18]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be really, you know, because it's on
my farm, I can walk through, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: how I do my seeds, how I do my clones,
um, my whole process.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then of course it's aquaponics focused
and we're going to build a system here on
[SPEAKER_18]: my farm.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've already got the reservoir dug.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, it'll be just a way that folks
can walk away and say, this is how I can
[SPEAKER_18]: simply build a commercial scale,
you know, eight foot wide aquaponics bed.
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll be a hundred feet long,
you know, and you take, you can scale from
[SPEAKER_18]: there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great information to be sharing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I, I'm sure that, uh, people will
get a lot out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that from going to your last
conference there that you did,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was just, uh, it was simultaneous to
lift, which was very unique in the sense
[SPEAKER_06]: that I saw them both, I just saw them as
both like parts that need to like fit into
[SPEAKER_06]: one another, you know, like so much of
Lyft had no idea what was going on at your
[SPEAKER_06]: conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so much of what was going on at your
conference was everything that was missing
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Lyft conference and everything
those people needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought, Oh my God, like if only
these motherfuckers realize like they just
[SPEAKER_06]: need to walk two blocks down the street
and all of their consultants, all of their
[SPEAKER_06]: like, they're just sitting right there,
the people that they need.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, it's just, you know,
I think that with humans, we just only
[SPEAKER_06]: know how to divide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just so much like, I'm really,
as I get older, all about this quiver idea
[SPEAKER_06]: and concept of having many arrows in my
quiver rather than a single arrow in my
[SPEAKER_06]: quiver, you know, like from, from an
extraction standpoint, being a part of a
[SPEAKER_06]: company that has seven different types of
extraction, including solvent extractions,
[SPEAKER_06]: that has never been my interest or focus
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did get to the point where I
realized that my opinion is maybe smaller
[SPEAKER_06]: than the opinions of the masses and what
they want to have access to.
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to have access to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want just one or the other,
you know, although they make it seem like
[SPEAKER_06]: that when they put a fence down the middle
and sort of pick one or the other.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a hard thing, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It truly is because like what everyone's
been talking about is there's this part of
[SPEAKER_18]: us that's lost.
[SPEAKER_18]: And like, I personally want to see,
you know, the world be full of small
[SPEAKER_18]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think that would change the
world in a better way, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, and this is where I guess
like you would never hear the 14 year old
[SPEAKER_18]: me saying this in, but this but part,
you know, what we have is, is a large
[SPEAKER_18]: agricultural system.
[SPEAKER_18]: And to take advantage of it and to be able
to hop into it and change it from within
[SPEAKER_18]: is the opportunity we have with hemp right
now.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just kind of realizing that in
myself.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now with actually just getting to
meet some folks from the conference,
[SPEAKER_18]: Tara Lee, who hops on all the time,
her and her husband, they, they service,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, big ag in Washington and all the
hemp farmers, they sell fittings and
[SPEAKER_18]: sprayers and tanks.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they explained to me that folks will
set up these nutrient yards, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: will be a two, three, five acre facility.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they'll, they'll be making big new
tanks and these semis will come in and
[SPEAKER_18]: feed off these, these new tanks and then
go out and, and, you know, apply to the
[SPEAKER_18]: fields.
[SPEAKER_18]: And her thought was like, why don't you
and Leighton do that with your compost
[SPEAKER_18]: tea?
[SPEAKER_18]: And why don't you grow hemp in,
you know, in Eastern Washington?
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was just like, yeah, that's kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: But as I've gotten involved in hemp in the
last couple of weeks, I planted 1300 seeds
[SPEAKER_18]: last night.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually applied for my permit and I'm
doing hemp up here on my property and I'm
[SPEAKER_18]: really stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm kind of just figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and I'm realizing that that's a huge
way to make an impact.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we're talking about kind of
partnering together and I'm going to,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, grow the seed that we can then
use to sell to farmers and kind of get
[SPEAKER_18]: them on a different path.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you want to start on a new crop
and here's a way that we can help
[SPEAKER_18]: facilitate building up your soil,
you know, in the same token.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I kind of, I see it's, I feel both
sides of it, honestly, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's, it's just, it's the world we live
in, in some, some respects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, cannabis is unique in the sense that
it's been in the shadows, it's been in the
[SPEAKER_06]: closets, it's been in the basement and it
has this like attachment to it,
[SPEAKER_06]: unlike anything else I've ever seen where
there's this real like, like, I think it
[SPEAKER_06]: teaches people compassion and empathy and
they're rooted in those experiences with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they can't remove it,
even though they're also like,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's removed them from this prison of
being a slave to a monetary system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually at a young age, you're like,
you figure out like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: like if I bring like a couple ounces of
this shit, like all my friends will buy
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they've got friends that will buy
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you figure out pretty early on that
you can make money selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, I definitely think
cannabis is, is special in that respect.
[SPEAKER_18]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: Kelly talks about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, you know, but I believe all plants
really have that, that in them.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've been listening to like the
regenerative agriculture podcast with
[SPEAKER_18]: this, this John Kemp guy, and he's got
these old school farmers on there that are
[SPEAKER_18]: converting over to regenerative style.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm so damn impressed, you know,
because at the heart of it, all these
[SPEAKER_18]: farmers, even the guys that are using,
using chemicals, they really love the
[SPEAKER_18]: earth.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, they can't make money.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're pressed and they're making bad
decisions.
[SPEAKER_18]: And like, if you can show them the right
way, they're all about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, in this, I don't know this
podcast, I just want to shout it out
[SPEAKER_18]: because it just brought, showed me how,
how, you know, these old farmers that are
[SPEAKER_18]: converting over, it's changing their lives
and the way they look at agriculture and
[SPEAKER_18]: the way they look at their, their own
happiness, you know, and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, it's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel the police are having the same
revelation with enforcing cannabis laws as
[SPEAKER_06]: these cannabis laws deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's much the same thing where
they're just like, any cop can tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: like, obviously people who use cannabis do
not cause us any problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's the, they'll ask any cop or
anyone that works at 911, they'll tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: like alcohol is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like gangs are a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's drunk driving, but like people
just using cannabis, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the farming is a way of life as well,
you know, so it's, it's very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're better drivers as we've found
out, you know, through studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is very awesome to take some
hits and go on a nice little drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say that?
[SPEAKER_08]: What I meant to say is, you know,
there are children in the room who can be
[SPEAKER_08]: tested here in Canada, so I'll be careful.
[SPEAKER_08]: One second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's partly our
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way we feel about, you know,
just growing, you know, in a way that's
[SPEAKER_02]: better for the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know, we're even big,
large agriculture, whatever everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten sick at one point, and we've talked
about this before, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they see some kind of degradation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just think it's important for us
to do our best to regenerate life on
[SPEAKER_02]: earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people say, you know,
what is regenerative farming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Regenerative farming is soil that's better
at the end of the year than when it
[SPEAKER_02]: started, or you've planted more new things
on your property every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And earlier, you know, you all were
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people want different choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that if people are educated
on the choices that they're given,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to definitely choose,
you know, the earth and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose something healthy and they're going
to choose something that makes them feel
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to choose something that
is so socially responsible, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think innately, people really want to make
the right decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, it's such a vast amount
of bad information and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look over here and shiny flossy,
you know, that is just really leading,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more money and greed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we have a social
responsibility as cannabis farmers right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, because we're here having this
conversation that we need to educate our
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, we need to educate our consumers
and give them the choice on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's really important in
moving in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, creating a new system, a different
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, you know, like the the Swedish
schoolgirl there, Greta Thunberg,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you guys have seen her speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's really inspirational.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like when in front of the UN and was
talking about climate change and telling
[SPEAKER_06]: the adults they weren't responsible enough
and that, you know, that they were just
[SPEAKER_06]: they were like, we're going to take this
over now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she basically said when there are no
solutions, to find for your in your
[SPEAKER_06]: system, then it's time for a new system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like you don't like she's 15
years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you haven't seen her before,
Greta Thunberg, Google her up and check
[SPEAKER_06]: out her her weapon that she gave to to the
UN address there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of reminded me of David Suzuki's
daughter, who also did a pretty good one
[SPEAKER_06]: back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't seen that one, where she
also just like lays into the United
[SPEAKER_06]: Nations.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty, pretty inspirational.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Greta Thunberg, if you've never
heard of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Einstein, Albert Einstein also says
that when you've run out of solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've lost your creativity.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still can't hear the turners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this like going to be the torture of my
day?
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear us now?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_11]: My God, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Normally it works just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys are a patient lot and we do
appreciate you spending time with us on
[SPEAKER_06]: this Sunday of afternoons.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is everything going?
[SPEAKER_13]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just started my own foundation
called the Colton Turner Foundation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to be raising funds to fund
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the medical benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is perfect for you guys to be doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the perfect face for such a
foundation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm definitely going to go out of my
way and bend over backwards to help raise
[SPEAKER_06]: funds for your foundation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really important to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have found that every time we go to a
doctor with Colton, that they say,
[SPEAKER_13]: oh, there's no evidence that cannabis
works.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's your evidence right here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how much more blatant you can
get than Colton Turner's colon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even more so than that, the words of a
mother who was going through losing a son
[SPEAKER_06]: and then have it turned around and like,
how do you not just put, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: we all have mothers, we all have nothing
but respect for our mothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, if the mom says so,
then it shall be so.
[SPEAKER_13]: It shall be so.
[SPEAKER_13]: I say so.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that not proof enough?
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, these doctors, this is the
challenge that we have is that these
[SPEAKER_13]: doctors don't listen.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have their own mindset.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have their own agendas.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Colton sat in the hospital for 31 days
just recently because he had an ulcer in
[SPEAKER_13]: his stomach or in his duodenum.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they kept saying, oh, no, it's his
Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's his Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's his Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're like, no, it's not his Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were like, yeah, but it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, but it isn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, why are you not listening to us?
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the things that one of the
reasons why they don't want to listen is
[SPEAKER_13]: because we were cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that we don't have the evidence,
the clinical proof that cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_13]: works in the United States.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, there is tons of studies across the
world, Israel, Spain, Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: That are coming out with some major,
major awesome evidence that cannabis works
[SPEAKER_13]: for a multitude of situations.
[SPEAKER_13]: But here in the US, the doctors are still,
you know, it's not FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's federally illegal still.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a schedule one, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all heard the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're tired of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to create a foundation for by
the time it becomes available to test,
[SPEAKER_13]: to have these FDA approvals, to make sure
that when you guys are talking about
[SPEAKER_13]: genetics, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't know why it works in
Colton.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if it's a specific
cannabinoid, if it's a specific genetic,
[SPEAKER_13]: if it's a specific strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we've had to go through all of this
craziness to try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, we need more evidence.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need more research.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need more people like you guys doing
the work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can't really do the work when
you're trying to run a business too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're hoping that this foundation is
going to allow people, farmers,
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivators, MIPS people, you know,
product inventors to have the money to do
the work.
[SPEAKER_13]: To do extra research on patients to make
sure that what their product is,
[SPEAKER_13]: is actually working for patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so crazy that it's this, once again,
this division where you have this sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: like, oh, we want to do things organically
and regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, we're going to do it
with salts and we're going to do it
[SPEAKER_06]: monster style.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have the same thing happening
with you guys where you're like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys kind of are the representation of
the organic farmer being listened by big
[SPEAKER_06]: bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: The doctors and they're just like,
no, no, it's just Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know we went to school for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine, Mrs. Turner.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to you here in a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just unbelievable that there's,
why don't we have a system that engages
[SPEAKER_06]: the people in a different way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that uses both Eastern and Western
medicine, but also engages the patient as
[SPEAKER_06]: part of this experience rather than just
being talked to, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're a wall, but being like,
listen to what I have to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we tell you is going to help you
diagnose what's going on here because
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not with us 24 seven and we are,
you know, like how can you not listen to
[SPEAKER_06]: that?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly, that is the question of the
millennium.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why patients aren't listened
to.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see it every single day on Facebook and
all of these groups that we are involved
[SPEAKER_13]: in.
[SPEAKER_13]: My doctor doesn't listen.
[SPEAKER_13]: My doctor said it was this.
[SPEAKER_13]: My doctor said that Salar wasn't giving me
the side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hear it every single day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're well, you know,
they they don't want to listen to the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they don't want to say that
cannabis actually does help with
[SPEAKER_13]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't want to say that it can
actually Crohn's or cancer or any of
[SPEAKER_13]: these.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to deny that reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, I deny that reality and
replace it with an artificial version of
[SPEAKER_06]: my own.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and I don't know if it's because of
the big pharma.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they're getting a lot of money
from these pharmaceutical companies and
[SPEAKER_13]: they're not a lot of money kickbacks from
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So is that the reason why we don't know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that most doctors are good,
though, and want to do well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And their Hippocratic oath is that they
shall do no harm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they must be so cognitively dissonant
to what is going on and have convinced
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, this is fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met great doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there are great healers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're healers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're people that want to help heal
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've somehow gone down this road
where, you know, I think it's part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: schooling and the teaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's very much like it's not it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, to use the metaphor,
it's not very regenerative the way they
[SPEAKER_06]: learn about medicine and the way they go
about healing in what in Western medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: and at least that it's not accepting of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they've never been taught about
the endocrine or cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine being a doctor and not
having been taught about an entire system?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, imagine them not being taught about
the central nervous system or the immune
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've worked with so many doctors
over in third world countries and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: helped set up clinics and we have to
recruit doctors from all different parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the world for them to come over and
work in our little small clinics that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a lot of machines that go bing
and don't have, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to be required to use their
hands and to use their intuition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in working in a clinic where,
you know, there's obstetricians that come
[SPEAKER_01]: from all over the world and they're the
best in their field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they don't have their Doppler,
their machines, they don't actually know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to work with patients and they
actually feel ripped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel as if they, you know,
went into a system where they wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: become a healer and they didn't really get
that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, here we go back to what
you all were talking about earlier is
[SPEAKER_01]: we're set up within a system that's
totally broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something about humanity that
continues to set up systems that we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually work within.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what, you know,
that issue is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something really large and
existential and we could go on for hours
[SPEAKER_01]: and hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to doctors, you know,
they are not getting the proper education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their education is through
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't tell you about curative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can just tell you what pharmaceutical
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's incredibly
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I blame that on the system yet again.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that a lot of it is because we
live in such a society that is instant
[SPEAKER_13]: gratification and they they just don't
want to take the time anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, Colton sat in the hospital
for 31 days and 31 days they did nothing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But he was he was getting sicker and
sicker and sicker.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, what what are you going to
do?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're telling me the same thing over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you you're not listening to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't I didn't understand why that
kept going.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, other than, you know,
finally, one of the doctors come in and
[SPEAKER_13]: said, well, why aren't you giving him his
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, I can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: He doesn't have a card.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not in the state of Illinois anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they and she was like, I try to find
some anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if that was that's what works
for them and they can do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, we were just like,
then give us some medicine so we can get
[SPEAKER_13]: out of this place.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we take we get him out of the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_13]: And here here it goes.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we give him extra cannabis,
you know, double his dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's fine again.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and all of a sudden,
all everything is gone and and he's back
to normal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's gaining weight.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's gained like 30 pounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the doctors just wanted that instant
gratification or they wanted to do the
[SPEAKER_13]: surgery so they could have that fifty
thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and for whatever reason, I know that
there are patients out there that have
[SPEAKER_13]: great doctors and I know that there are
great doctors out there, but I just don't
[SPEAKER_13]: think that they understand the plant as
much as what we do and what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that that's where the
disconnect is.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that we as as cannabis,
the cannabis community really need to get
[SPEAKER_13]: into educating about genetics and about
about how things work in our bodies with
[SPEAKER_13]: the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's the biggest disconnect.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're going to start to see doing FDA
trials in order to create cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_15]: pharmaceuticals is fairly expensive.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in a black market or unregulated
market, the it's difficult to raise money
[SPEAKER_15]: to fund that sort of research.
[SPEAKER_15]: What what I liken it to is, you know,
we have a couple of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_15]: pharmaceuticals that have been FDA
approved.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, when you I have a couple of
family members that are doctors and while
[SPEAKER_15]: they see the potential medical benefit in
cannabis, their Hippocratic oath do no
[SPEAKER_15]: harm, you know, prevents them from
suggesting or recommending herbal
[SPEAKER_15]: supplement cannabis or nutraceutical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're obliged to only provide
pharmaceutically approved drugs because
[SPEAKER_15]: they're concerned those pharmaceutically
approved drugs have gone through multiple
[SPEAKER_15]: tiers of FDA review in order to assure
that there is no potential side effects or
[SPEAKER_15]: minimize the potential side effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, as the industry starts rolling,
you see wider acceptance.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to start to see more of those
cannabinoid pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we're really seeing in the in the
CBD realm is broad acceptance as well as
[SPEAKER_15]: broad deployment of cannabinoid herbal
supplements and nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, a herbal supplement is going to be
regulated differently than a nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_15]: or a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we as patients need all three.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the pharmaceuticals are
necessary in order to get them listed on
[SPEAKER_15]: insurance prescribed by doctors under
doctor supervision.
[SPEAKER_15]: But taking drugs through FDA trials in
order to make a pharmaceutical grading
[SPEAKER_15]: takes millions of dollars, takes years of
trials that have to be supervised.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the US, it's incredibly difficult.
[SPEAKER_15]: My my lab in Illinois applied for to
supply NIDA four years, three or four
[SPEAKER_15]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, NIDA has yet to review any of the
applications.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's currently one supplier for the
company.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're talking about a company a
company in Illinois that has billions of
[SPEAKER_15]: dollars of resources already affiliated
with multiple universities and willing and
[SPEAKER_15]: capable of doing that research.
[SPEAKER_15]: But until we actually have the federal law
change, we can't.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to do that research abroad.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've done some work trying to create
some of that research in foreign
[SPEAKER_15]: countries.
[SPEAKER_15]: But until the US federal law gets off
their high horse and reschedules,
[SPEAKER_15]: deschedules or creates an exemption for
medical cannabis research, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_15]: doctors are kind of stuck in that mindset
where they want to see a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_15]: pharmaceutical pill that when we have
those pills, they can be covered by
[SPEAKER_15]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what they cannot talk about just due
to the lack of research are the
[SPEAKER_15]: nutraceuticals and herbal supplements.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have a wonderful opportunity to be
able to create companies with good
[SPEAKER_15]: corporate social responsibility to create
herbal supplements to minimize the
[SPEAKER_15]: deleterious effects of many medical
conditions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can't make medical claims on
nutraceuticals or herbal supplements,
[SPEAKER_15]: but we can formulate them in ways that we
know that they're going to be beneficial
[SPEAKER_15]: to our microbiome.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's really the key is being
able to everybody says an apple a day
[SPEAKER_15]: keeps a doctor away.
[SPEAKER_15]: Eat your greens.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cannabis should be treated as a essential
amino acid.
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be treated as a essential fatty
acid.
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be treated as a quintessential
part of the dietary intake of all humans.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the difficult part is when many
doctors have gone to school over the past
[SPEAKER_15]: 50 years, but the endocannabinoid system
has not been really researched and it
[SPEAKER_15]: wasn't discovered until the 80s.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not really researched or even taught
in universities.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're seeing this same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: The endocrine system wasn't really
discovered until the 50s.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could not learn about the endocrine
system in any med school until the 80s and
[SPEAKER_15]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_15]: And all of a sudden we're starting to see
lots of doctors specifically studying
[SPEAKER_15]: endocrine biology to help treat the
hormone issues.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of those hormone issues are
created by bad diet or bad microbiota in
[SPEAKER_15]: your system that's not creating the right
ecosystem within our microbiome.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that as sites like Granny
Crow's List becomes more widely dispersed,
[SPEAKER_15]: Granny Crow's List has 700 reviewed
research papers on cannabis, but- Granny
[SPEAKER_12]: Storm Crow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So being able to provide that education to
the doctors, they cannot prescribe the
[SPEAKER_15]: nutraceutical or herbal supplements.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just due to regulations, but they can kind
of, we can as a community create good
[SPEAKER_15]: corporate social responsibility,
educate those doctors as well as,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, kind of promote that research
through the companies that we're
[SPEAKER_15]: developing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of did this back in days and
kind of I had to do the same thing as I
[SPEAKER_08]: had to force my doctors to understand that
cannabis was helping me with my
[SPEAKER_08]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just like Michelle Rainey back in the
late 80s, early 90s, we put together
[SPEAKER_08]: doctors educational packages, enough
education, some of them are 36 pages long,
[SPEAKER_08]: just for the applications in order to
apply for medical marijuana in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we put together a little doctor
packages.
[SPEAKER_08]: I focused on injured workers, spinal cord
injury, Michelle's focus on cancer,
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like yourself, we can focus on getting
those packages put together that has all
[SPEAKER_08]: of that data that we've actually,
you can look to PubMed, Case Journal,
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just put together a nice little
doctor's package.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the doctor asks you a question,
you can present them with, here's the data
[SPEAKER_08]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the stuff that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's our foundation and get more people
on board.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's kind of like more back to the
grassroots of being able to like,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not going to click on a link,
but if you give them something that they
[SPEAKER_08]: can sit back at a coffee and read,
then they might draw some interest and
[SPEAKER_08]: they see how it's working for you and they
can see the benefits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's really important that we
still offer that little packages to the
[SPEAKER_08]: doctors and stuff like that in order to
get the education out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it draws more interest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's so many different ways of
being able to get doctors to understand
[SPEAKER_08]: how it's working for one another and your
prime example of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like just getting that information out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good idea too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember when you were doing that,
John, because even when you took me to go
[SPEAKER_06]: see my doctor, you brought like a big,
it was way more than 36 pages.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably like 100.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 pages or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, if we can get these type of
really good packages for specific things
[SPEAKER_06]: to these doctors and you get it out to
enough doctors, eventually what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to do is we're going to find the
cool doctor, the one who's really willing
[SPEAKER_06]: to hear and listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that doctor will be so important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those doctors, because they are the ones
that will go on to teach the other doctors
[SPEAKER_06]: that will never hear this from a certain
type of person, basically a non-doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're not going to teach a doctor
about medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, it's part of their ego.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 99.9% of them cannot be taught.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's this one, and I seen John get
through to them, the little 1% where it's
[SPEAKER_06]: just like, this is great stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any more?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're devouring it and reading it
and they're interested in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're going and doing their own deep
dives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those, I think those doctors will be
very important in the sort of education of
[SPEAKER_06]: the line of doctors that are up now,
but more so the new line, the new group
[SPEAKER_06]: that will be coming and going through
medical schools.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly the endocannabinoid system has to
be taught in medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to be doing it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be mandatory.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we have over a hundred years of bad
PR to get around.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's only one, and there's only one
university teaching cannabinoid classes
[SPEAKER_15]: that I've heard about.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a couple of cannabis trade
schools, but I believe there's a
[SPEAKER_15]: university in Michigan that you can take a
certificate for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you're a doctor in Canada or no,
should look up the synergy of these three
[SPEAKER_08]: was presented in 2012, 2013 in the
educated 1200 to 1600 doctors across
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada on the opioid system, the
endocannabinoid system and how it was very
[SPEAKER_08]: similar and how it worked with in the CNS.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually a really good little
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a great for a good start for
doctors in Canada to look at because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: already been presented.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of the things that's going to
come is as people become more aware of the
[SPEAKER_12]: fact that cannabis itself can't do any
harm as doctors start understanding how
[SPEAKER_12]: true that is in association with the
benefits that cannabis can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: When they start looking at the
pharmacopoeia, all the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_12]: drugs that they have, every one of them
has a lethal dose.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every one of them can kill you and often
create all kinds of other problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of the old people that I speak with
are taking multiple pharmaceutical drugs
[SPEAKER_12]: and when you start digging into that whole
list of things and start looking at side
[SPEAKER_12]: effects, some of the drugs are prescribed
to offset side effects of other drugs that
[SPEAKER_12]: they're taking and they end up with this
mad salad of pharmaceuticals in their
[SPEAKER_12]: bodies and it creates all kinds of health
problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's true is when you start
eliminating those and you start working
[SPEAKER_12]: with whole plant cannabis medicine,
that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like when you look at specific
isolated compounds like Marinol is
[SPEAKER_12]: supposed to be a pharmaceutical replica of
THC and yet you see widely different
[SPEAKER_12]: results from Marinol.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just doesn't work as well as straight
up cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, no lethal dose with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all these potential benefits from
its use.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was Russo that should be
credited with the concept of the
[SPEAKER_12]: endocannabinoid deficiency syndromes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's basically a list of all kinds of
conditions, everything from autism to
[SPEAKER_12]: cancer to epilepsy to MS to Hodgkin's
lymphoma, on and on, that all of these
[SPEAKER_12]: conditions respond, some better than
others, to cannabis preparations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the suggestion there is that all of
these are conditions that arise from
[SPEAKER_12]: imbalance in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not any one cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not CBD, it's not THC, it's not CBC.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the whole symphony of this beautiful
chemistry that this plant that we love so
[SPEAKER_12]: much makes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where the magic is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what doctors and patients all across
the world are starting to understand is
[SPEAKER_12]: that it's the plant itself and the
chemistry she produces that's gonna do
[SPEAKER_12]: this healing work for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: When Kelly was referencing working with
clinics where doctors from Western
[SPEAKER_12]: medicine don't have their machines,
but they still see healing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Healing happens in hospitals, but it also
happens in homes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And increasingly at home, people are
making preparations from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: plant and seeing benefit from it for
people that they love.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's because it actually works.
[SPEAKER_12]: It addresses the endocannabinoid
deficiencies that we're all experiencing
[SPEAKER_12]: because of the toxic effects of stress,
insufficient biome in our diet,
[SPEAKER_12]: on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_12]: The list goes, but many of us are
experiencing these health issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's true is cannabis has the
potential to be of benefit to all of those
[SPEAKER_12]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the trick is finding the preparations
that will benefit that person.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Turner's family, you're a perfect
example of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You found the preparation that was gonna
help Colin.
[SPEAKER_12]: You increased the dose to the point of
benefit and he was able to leave the
[SPEAKER_12]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm blown away to hear you say,
I think you said he gained 30 pounds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did you put that on your body as
you're sitting there?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all, I'm gonna sign off and listen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know where I put it either.
[SPEAKER_13]: He eats like crazy and he's just a thin
kid.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when it comes to, when you were
talking about genetics earlier and talking
[SPEAKER_13]: about whole plant and making sure that
this spectrum is there, one of the things
[SPEAKER_13]: that we're kind of back and forth on that
and that's what scares us is that the
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine that he takes is actually an
isolate.
[SPEAKER_13]: And only because there was an issue with
THCV with him.
[SPEAKER_13]: So with a Crohn's patient, he has a hard
time gaining weight.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when he gained 30 pounds within this
last six months, we've been really,
[SPEAKER_13]: really happy.
[SPEAKER_13]: But THCV is an appetite suppressant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So making sure that people who don't have
wasting syndromes like Colton,
[SPEAKER_13]: not get THCV is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when it comes to isolate versus full
spectrum, this is a really, really hard
[SPEAKER_13]: situation for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because THCV is bad for, it's not
necessarily bad because it helps people
[SPEAKER_04]: who just wanna lose weight or have
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've also heard that people with PTSD
have been benefiting from THCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for someone with a wasting syndrome,
it's deadly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to make sure that we are taking
the cannabinoids that- We need to be able
[SPEAKER_15]: to identify the adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have been greatly benefited by CBD and
CBDV, but THCV in particular in stressful
[SPEAKER_15]: situations can trigger myoblactic
seizures.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so in general, I avoid strangulation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I've ever been treated
with THCV.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also know people who have treated
depression- I've never been really
[SPEAKER_15]: benefited by CBD and CBDV, but- These
cannabinoids make sure that we understand
[SPEAKER_13]: the genetics of these plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think genetics is just exactly where
we need to be studying.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very crucial to the history and to
the future of these plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Making sure that we have specific medicine
for specific diseases.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can grow those plants in
coordinates with what Colton needs for
[SPEAKER_13]: Crohn's disease or what Sally needs for
her seizures or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those hopefully can help determine
that this strain is better for Crohn's or
[SPEAKER_13]: that strain is better for cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because even the terpenes matter to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a wild ride.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have so far to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that creating this foundation
and making sure that we are supporting
[SPEAKER_13]: people that are researching every single
aspect of this plant is so, so,
[SPEAKER_13]: so important.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it goes back to the quiver once
again, because once again, the division of
[SPEAKER_06]: humanity, you just, you see people like,
you know, they'll make these super strong
[SPEAKER_06]: posts about why isolate is wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all about full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, skunk man Sam showed us
all about terpene modulation in the early
[SPEAKER_06]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And years later, some of those people like
Ed Rosenthal wrote articles about mercy
[SPEAKER_06]: and mangoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ethan Russo came out with the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, 20 years later,
this conversation has escalated to the
[SPEAKER_06]: point where everyone's really hip and
they're on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they, it's like, yeah, yeah,
some people need terpene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people would like isolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people don't want this cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people want these two cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we need to have access to all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be able to take it apart and
study it and figure out mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we need to have access to full
plant regeneratively organically grown,
[SPEAKER_06]: like beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, I just fall on both sides
in the sense of like, both are as
[SPEAKER_06]: important and obviously as Colton sits
there telling us that he's taking isolate
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously it has, it's a very dangerous
statement to go out and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: isolate's not going to do it for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what are people's versions of
full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like are they collecting the
entire cannabinoid and terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_06]: all the different types of trichomes that
are present on their plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're doing traditional hash methods,
they're probably leaving most of the
[SPEAKER_06]: bulbous heads behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that won't be full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just so many different ways of
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think personally, let's make sure
everything is available for those that
[SPEAKER_06]: want to have access to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we obviously want to be able to
hear.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'd love to hear Sam's take on all
this.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you've been working with Marinol
for extremely long time and it would be
[SPEAKER_17]: really helpful and really great insight to
hear your insight on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I can talk about that, but what I
actually wanted to talk about was genetic
[SPEAKER_10]: IPs for just a moment.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if everybody heard that in
Colorado, they are now allowing plant
[SPEAKER_10]: registration of cannabis varieties under
UPOG.
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anybody heard that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I have Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Colin.
[SPEAKER_10]: As for patents, I've heard several people
say that patents for
[SPEAKER_10]: a plant that hasn't existed in nature and
the only way they can prove that is has it
[SPEAKER_10]: been tested and is it in the literature,
then you can patent it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can challenge it all you want,
but unless you can prove that it was
[SPEAKER_10]: already in public domain before the
patent, then you can't fight it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can everyone hear him clearly because it
sounds like he's coming in and out to me.
[SPEAKER_17]: I lost a big chunk of that, but I got the
very end of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got most of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm having real problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: I
[SPEAKER_10]: don't know what to do to make it any
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: That always makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Except when you've dropped your dabber and
it literally fell through a porthole and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dabber is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dabber has fallen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't lose your dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I didn't totally hear everything
what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he saying that it was really hard to
patent?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he was saying that, listen,
if you can prove that it's never a part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the open source, the black market,
if you've got something unique,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can patent it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was basically saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys want to get into
technical patent land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here to provide that information
if you would like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't so Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's too early for
technical patent land.
[SPEAKER_15]: Give us patent land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you patent land.
[SPEAKER_15]: Define prior art in the cannabis genetic
realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior art in the genetic realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all tolls, prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, there's people talking in my house
and it's making it hard to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is actually better anyway,
because it's like kind of beautiful out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then we can spend time in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior art in the genetics realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior art in general is any sort of
like documentation about a like any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of invention that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, you know, just to give people an
idea of the process, when an application
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to the patent office, the patent
examiner has the obligation to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of things that might be similar
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like like something comes in,
someone says they invented something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then patent examiners go and look for
things that match the claims in the
[SPEAKER_00]: document.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the evidence in the documents
that they look to is known as prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the realm of prior art,
there are some specific rules about what
[SPEAKER_00]: is and is not prior art, at least within
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm not I should also always just
say I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal
[SPEAKER_00]: advice, but this is stuff that I've
learned from talking to lots of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's any lawyers out there,
I always ask them to if I if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: technically incorrect about anything,
please openly correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, but my understanding is
the way it works is so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that the patent office looks to
is known as prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are definitely there's a whole
section in the patent code that is about
[SPEAKER_00]: what is prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely look at things like old
patent applications and they also
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely look to things like academic
journals and printed publications and
[SPEAKER_00]: another sort of set list of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those set list of things is the
National Center for Biotechnology
[SPEAKER_00]: Information, the NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for genetic information and for
genetic data and for genetic data that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been referenced on Open Cannabis Project,
it is all actually hosted on the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for Biotechnology Information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a genetics and prior art
perspective, that's really the place where
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes and where it's the most important
place to look to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken with a last year, I got on the
phone with the with a supervisor at the
[SPEAKER_00]: patent office in the plant department and
let him know about data that Open Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Project org.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also knew about the phyllis galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two things, at least in through
that kind of realm, are considered by at
[SPEAKER_00]: least by some as prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant officer told me that it was
something that he wanted to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: his department knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in any case, so that's sort of how
genetics plays into prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within the realm of the actual patents
that are coming in, part of the reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: Open Cannabis Project switched to
collecting chemical data last year was
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of the patent applications
coming in actually reference chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and chemical formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that actually also becomes in some
ways, at least right now, more important
[SPEAKER_00]: with regards to prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many people have argued that even
though genetic information isn't as useful
[SPEAKER_00]: right now for prior art, it can be useful
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to doing the most robust
kind of prior art documentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that Open Cannabis
Project was not ever able to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe is something that can come from
future efforts and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: new partnerships and all that kind of
stuff, is the idea of actually doing whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar, if anyone's listened to Dr.
Eleanor Koontz, who is kind of my hero in
[SPEAKER_00]: this and her work at the Candor Herbarium,
what she's talking about is actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: really, like, thorough documentation of
the cannabis plant itself, which provides
[SPEAKER_00]: more information that would be useful to
the patent office, such as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what strains it's been and to breeders,
actually, honestly, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_00]: share and sort the information,
you know, what strains have been bred with
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: What environment was it grown in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what other special information can
you share about the lineage of this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's gone into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, when you're talking about,
like, what is a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that most people agree
that it's like genetics plus environment
[SPEAKER_00]: plus cultivation equals phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, all of that really needs to be
documented if we're going to do really
[SPEAKER_00]: thorough prior art documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that information can be,
as long as that information is searchable
[SPEAKER_00]: and organized enough and you can submit it
to the patent office in booklet form,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that I think that as we
look to solutions for getting prior art in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of the patent office, it's either
creating, which I tried to do with open
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis project, MIT actually has a prior
art database.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great to get all of these
cannabis strains into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten an answer on whether
they'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, most universities
are in this really tough position when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to information about cannabis
because it's still federally illegal and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get a lot of federal funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but in any case, that's at least
hopefully beginning to help answer the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to answer any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But speaking to the idea that like people
can just patent things that are already in
[SPEAKER_00]: the public domain, I would I would
actually say that, you know, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: people realize it or not, like people have
like open cannabis project, medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics, phylose, the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have made a lot of noise about
saying, hey, don't issue patents on things
[SPEAKER_00]: that already exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would, you know, I haven't actually
seen any more overbroad patents issued
[SPEAKER_00]: since the first, well, potentially
overbroad patents issued since the first
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that have been issued to the Biotech
Institute.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't act like I know that patent
applications like that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how many do you see so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to some degree, I don't see as much
like of an actual risk from the patent
[SPEAKER_00]: office patenting things that are already
in the public domain because there is more
[SPEAKER_00]: information available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have made us think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know about all of these
references.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't I think that there is reason to
fear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think that as where I think a
lot of the litigation that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen with regards to overbroad patents
and taking things out of the public domain
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has a lot more to do with like
herbal formulations and like formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and processing methods than it does on the
plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's my long winded nerdy
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: So normally when you're developing a
patent application for genetic cultivar
[SPEAKER_15]: for a species of plant in other other
realms, be it hops or in the agri-
[SPEAKER_15]: cultural industry, they're looking for a
couple of different factors that
[SPEAKER_15]: mentioned, you know, phenotypic.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it what's it grow?
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it produce?
[SPEAKER_15]: When you start looking at genetically
engineered, you have to be able to show
[SPEAKER_15]: that the gene sequence that you're
selecting for is exhibited in over 80
[SPEAKER_15]: percent of the populations.
[SPEAKER_15]: And oftentimes the in order to create that
speciation or novel the patent office,
[SPEAKER_15]: especially when they're patenting germ
lines or genetically engineered germ
[SPEAKER_15]: lines, they want to be able to see that a
significant majority of the seeds that are
[SPEAKER_15]: planted are going to exhibit that trait.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a F1 multipoly hybrid has not been
stabilized enough to be able to show those
[SPEAKER_15]: standardized traits within its cultivar.
[SPEAKER_15]: So many I'm seeing kind of several things
happen where people are finding rare,
[SPEAKER_15]: rare mutations in some of their CBD things
and considering it novel.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that rare mutation has to then be
inbred, stabilized, developed,
[SPEAKER_15]: essentially worked until it becomes a
significant majority of genetic expression
[SPEAKER_15]: and essentially selecting for the
recessive traits in order to to lock those
[SPEAKER_15]: recessive traits in with.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think a lot of there's a lot of
concern that breeders are going to do F1
[SPEAKER_15]: hybrids and then try and patent them.
[SPEAKER_15]: The reality is that breeding is going to
involve multiple generations of
[SPEAKER_15]: stabilization in order to start protecting
those patents.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're dead on.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the most difficult part about
everything right now is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: there's such misinformation out there that
everyone's feelers and everyone's feelers
[SPEAKER_17]: are up.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just need to dispel a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: So everyone really truly understands that
it's a lot more difficult than just like
[SPEAKER_17]: fixing things and trying to, you know,
do a do a basic flip.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And ultimately, you know, that's where I
that's where genetic companies that are
[SPEAKER_15]: testing the genetics being producing those
tests for their customers is really useful
[SPEAKER_15]: because, you know, breeders, if they can,
you know, and I've done this on multi
[SPEAKER_15]: acreage scale where we'll send in large
numbers of CBD seedlings to get tested,
[SPEAKER_15]: identify the ones that are female that
also exhibit the double recessive CBDA
[SPEAKER_15]: alleles and then be able to mass propagate
those so that you end up having instead of
[SPEAKER_15]: one standardized seed, you have a couple
different cultivars that you're then
[SPEAKER_15]: propagating into into a field regenerative
system.
[SPEAKER_15]: That way you can then not have to worry
about culling all of the the
[SPEAKER_15]: hermaphroditic traits or the non the hot
traits.
[SPEAKER_15]: But on the same hand, we obviously it
would be great if companies that are doing
[SPEAKER_15]: that genetic tested facilitated
distribution of those genetics through
[SPEAKER_15]: some sort of open licensing, even if those
open licensing includes kickbacks to the
[SPEAKER_15]: breeders or the genetic developers.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the I think the concern is is a
perceived conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there may be separate
companies, but there is somewhat of a
[SPEAKER_15]: perceived conflict of interest in when a
genetic testing company is then creating a
[SPEAKER_15]: genetic nursery company.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the likelihood that a leaf tissue
sample could get turned back into stem
[SPEAKER_15]: cells and then repropagated is very low.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there is a risk for anyone who
submitted seeds, especially seeds in mass
[SPEAKER_15]: to a genetic company, because if I'm
running a testing laboratory for testing
[SPEAKER_15]: the chemotrophic samples of cannabis,
I'm going to save part of my sample in
[SPEAKER_15]: case if the test comes back weird so I can
retest it just to standardize that test.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I don't think that any genetic
companies are repopulating genetics,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I do believe that they are correlating
their data.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can use once you start
identifying, hey, this one allele trait
[SPEAKER_15]: that showed up on our genetic sequence
that we weren't looking for years later
[SPEAKER_15]: could potentially be used for creating
this precursor to a novel cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_15]: because there are numerous cannabinoids
that aren't in wide distribution.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we can find those significantly
recessive allele genetic snips,
[SPEAKER_15]: then we could potentially say,
OK, this strain from this breeder,
[SPEAKER_15]: this strain from this breeder,
these four strains from these four
[SPEAKER_15]: breeders, now we can start developing a
breeding platform to be able to select for
[SPEAKER_15]: those rare genetic alleles to create rare
genetic cannabinoids, reinforce those over
[SPEAKER_15]: eight to 10 generations until it becomes a
predominant profile.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's going to require a lot of
testing.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to require a lot of work,
a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want the people doing that genetic
work to be able to see some success from
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, in some realm,
I think that patents are going to be a
[SPEAKER_15]: necessity.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we do with those patents,
we don't want to be able to take rare
[SPEAKER_15]: genetic alleles off the market and only
make them available in pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_15]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's far better to be able to have that a
multiple time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam sounds like the teacher on Charlie
Brown.
[SPEAKER_17]: We lost you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: We lost you.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is crucial, Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish you were in this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like there's quite a few things I
want to hear from him right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's harsh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the truth of it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is my voice normal or is it all screwed
up?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of screwed up, but that's
normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew you'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I just want to say that in Colorado
this month, the first UPUB plant
[SPEAKER_10]: registration breeder's rights has been
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am wondering if this comment can be
submitted in the chat because I really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that all of us are struggling
because we want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the audio connection does not seem to
be working.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you should type it, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can we can all read it or send
it to me in Skype or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever works, because I really do want
to hear from you right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think what he I only heard parts
of that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think what he mentioned was the so
recently the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: Department of Agriculture has started
saying that they're allowing plant
[SPEAKER_15]: registration on cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, they're primarily phrasing that in
the realm of hemp cultivars.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there have in the last month,
there have been a few Colorado hemp
[SPEAKER_15]: cultivars that were developed from
cultivars, not from not indigenous to
[SPEAKER_15]: Colorado, but they've been worked by
companies in Colorado and they have been
[SPEAKER_15]: applied for on on that plant registration.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are going to start to see that
starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've even seen a couple of these CBD
seed breeders are requiring their
[SPEAKER_15]: customers to sign material transfer
agreements that requires non non
[SPEAKER_15]: replication, which I kind of understand a
seed breeder doesn't want to have the
[SPEAKER_15]: seeds knocked off.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they also include things like no
cloning and no breeding with those
[SPEAKER_15]: strains.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason why that company is doing
that is because they want to have to be
[SPEAKER_15]: able to start protecting those lines and
they don't want to have their their work
[SPEAKER_15]: knocked off.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think it's it's a little bit over
intrusive to try and require people to
[SPEAKER_15]: develop your work.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to be honest, I think it's bad
marketing.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're developing a line that ends up
becoming, for example, the next Harlequin
[SPEAKER_15]: or Charlotte's Web, tons of potential
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's people working with your line
are only it's only going to benefit them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sammy, they're.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's there, but I bet it's not going to
sound any better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's that's kind of how we feel
is, I mean, we every every event that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've gone to, we have seed swaps,
you know, and it's always like the funnest
[SPEAKER_02]: thing about the event, you know,
just sharing genetics and doing all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it's like we come around the
corner after a seed swap and then slam off
[SPEAKER_02]: breaks and oh, my God, why we have to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stop going to seed swaps now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start saving all my seeds
because I'm just nervous someone else is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to maybe do it better than me or
they're going to mass produce it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to take me out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really just believe that the art is
in creating the genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're all lucky to even be
talking about this, if we're honest with
[SPEAKER_02]: each other, because this plant came from
wherever it came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody did it before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're putting intellectual property
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the the bubba kush hemp,
you know, I mean, that's that's an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, you know, intellectual thing that
was created there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's maybe there's
there's a lot of value to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, I think like with three
with IP and recipes, we've always given
[SPEAKER_02]: out everything for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we even have a company that's
potentially threatened by giving out that
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just feel like if someone takes
that and makes the world a better place,
[SPEAKER_02]: then who's really losing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just challenged to become better
and more diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you own a part of a plant's
evolution?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand like this ownership of
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is always evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're patenting something that's like
way back in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to evolve so many
times past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's just a really interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and I think that we have some kind
of a of a disease or a virus inside of our
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA that we thrive off of competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we have this ability for
the plant and what she's taught us and the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that we commune within the cannabis
culture to really drop that idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: competition and be able to share and open
source it and make it already art that has
[SPEAKER_01]: happened before so that other people can't
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of people in the
cannabis culture are not really wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily to own something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want somebody else to own
it so that we can't work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's really more of the
focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we want people to have good
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people to protect something that
they've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that we shouldn't be
threatening threatened by something else
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the way we feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and you guys can say what you will
imagine if the guy who created a guitar
[SPEAKER_17]: said you couldn't no one else could make
guitars.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, dude, I use that I use the real
big extract is super extract.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, like, come on,
you know, it's there'd be no diversity in
[SPEAKER_17]: music and culture.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that, too, transcends culture and and
humanity.
[SPEAKER_17]: In so many ways, just yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, when Quincy Jones takes
like particular notes and puts them in an
[SPEAKER_06]: order.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: He can own those now.
[SPEAKER_16]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can also be sampled and turned into
something else.
[SPEAKER_16]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, how cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is actually where I think that
because y'all are talking about like like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interesting in this conversation
because it brings up a really important
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I was it brings a really
important point about intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property and the word intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a word that I don't want
to use anymore because it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: really confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's confusing because it is one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually like after all this
craziness with open cannabis project and
[SPEAKER_00]: reading more Richard Stallman and all that
kind of stuff, he's actually one who comes
[SPEAKER_00]: up with this idea that like intellectual
property actually is a term that is meant
[SPEAKER_00]: to reference, depending on who you're
talking to, between three and nine
[SPEAKER_00]: different sets of laws that actually all
work differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Quincy Jones's notes that he puts
together is covered under copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one set of laws that is applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are covered under not only patent
law, but they're also covered under USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: protections, which is actually the plant
variety protection thing that I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam was talking about that opened up in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant variety protection is for stable
seed lines, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually run by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is ownership law at play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even so, there is ownership law at play.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like when we talk about
plants or seeds that are in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: domain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants and seeds that might be in the
public domain from a patenting standpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: and from a USDA standpoint still might be
owned by somebody, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they might be owned by, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be owned by bubble man,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if they are actually
owned by somebody, then they are affected
[SPEAKER_00]: by the rules of contract law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because all of these
laws are kind of at odds with what we
[SPEAKER_00]: think and how we feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But understanding them, and this is where
I feel like education is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: for this community in particular,
I want for us to be able to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: these laws work so that we can effectively
use these tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying that patents are it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really don't like patents on
plants, especially cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be able to understand how
these laws work so that we can effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate it and not be caught in a
situation where we actually hurt ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: because just we misunderstood something or
conflated a couple of different concepts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And careful when you're talking about it
and you don't make your statement that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not really pro plant patents
because man, can you trigger some people?
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant patents in the cannabis world
triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also like plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where I also like you know,
I kind of have a like a challenge or like
[SPEAKER_00]: a challenging question that I would be
interested to hear from folks on this
[SPEAKER_00]: group about, which is that like,
OK, so a plant patent really covers a
[SPEAKER_00]: single plant and its clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA protection covers a stable seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utility patents can cover like,
you know, within one document,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a plant plus its clones, plus its
seeds, plus all the products made with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus anything made with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, my question is,
like from an ethical standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is wrong with a plant patent or a
USDA stable seed line protection if all
[SPEAKER_00]: that it really says is, yes, I invented
this, but sure, people can still breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I actually don't necessarily think
it's a good use of money or time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm interested to hear from the group
like what your thoughts are on these like
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of like protection options
and where the ethics, ethical lines are
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn within the beliefs of the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the problem with the ethical lines
is that they are they are warped and
[SPEAKER_06]: manipulated by the lawyers who write up
these these laws and these these these
[SPEAKER_06]: documents in the first place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's that's kind of probably
the main problem that it becomes corrupted
[SPEAKER_06]: from the start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, the foundation of it is like,
I mean, a lawyer, a good lawyer's job is
[SPEAKER_06]: to stretch and to find that that the the
envelope and to kind of get it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, let's push it even further in
our favor, because, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_06]: that's I work for my clients and I'm
looking to, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: best that interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, there's lots of good jokes
about lawyers, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the question of the ethics behind the
people that are submitting that said
[SPEAKER_17]: patent and the years, you know,
the intention behind it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's so much that goes on and on
that, you know, is clearly undefinable
[SPEAKER_17]: until it's too late.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's let's start with a clone,
because I think that's the that's one of
[SPEAKER_15]: the more narrow ones.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've I've heard of several
different companies in multiple states
[SPEAKER_15]: that we're looking for genetics to bring
to bring into their production facilities.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, it's difficult to have interstate
commerce, but there are ways that you can
[SPEAKER_15]: immaculately conceive those genetics into
those things and then create a licensing
[SPEAKER_15]: on copyright.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's copyrighted or trademarked
names.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've actually seen some European seed
companies that are trademarking names.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if you're a licensed producer,
you can license that trademarked name in
[SPEAKER_15]: order to sell those seed lines.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I get approached all the time like
that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's there's a ton of people out there
absolutely going out there reaching out to
[SPEAKER_17]: people.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if if a breeder has to spend the money
and is doing breeding properly,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not talking about pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking about developing facilities
that are that are specifically designed to
[SPEAKER_15]: prevent pollen from spreading around cross
pollination.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to build pollination chambers for
your breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're doing those phenol hunting to
the actions to develop those lines,
[SPEAKER_15]: then as interstate and international
commerce begins, it's going to be very
[SPEAKER_15]: beneficial to the breeders to develop
those lines and potentially license them
[SPEAKER_15]: out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just so that, you know, now that said,
the minute you start selling seeds,
[SPEAKER_15]: for example, it's difficult to license a
strain to a grower.
[SPEAKER_15]: They say to a farm if you're also selling
seeds, because that farms part of the
[SPEAKER_15]: licensee, legally speaking, wants to know
that they're going to be if they're going
[SPEAKER_15]: to pay that premium to have that specific
clone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, you know, they want to know that
you're not openly distributing that clone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I've seen licenses where that,
you know, you have that proprietary clone,
[SPEAKER_15]: but you still can have genetic hybrids.
[SPEAKER_15]: Available, and I think some breeders in
Europe are doing that, where they're still
[SPEAKER_15]: selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you want an exclusive license on my
this this chemotrophic profile of this
[SPEAKER_15]: phenotype of this gene sequence cut of
this clone, then I think that's a good way
[SPEAKER_15]: for, you know, growers and specifically
breeders to generate revenue when you
[SPEAKER_15]: can't have those genetics legally
transferring across jurisdictional
[SPEAKER_15]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, in Canada has a pedigreed seed
program.
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of European countries also have
pedigreed seed programs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And part of that pedigreed seed,
I think Josh and Kelly mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_15]: developing feminized line.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you have to if you're going to
do a pedigreed seed program, not only do
[SPEAKER_15]: you have to create that standardized seed,
but you also have to be able to produce it
[SPEAKER_15]: where you you and your farm minimizes risk
of pollination.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are parts of Oregon that that
had really big problems with cross
[SPEAKER_15]: pollination from hemp farms that hemp
farms that were doing breeding were
[SPEAKER_15]: getting pollinated by hemp farms that were
just open pollinating hybrids to harvest
[SPEAKER_15]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Canada actually has rules and
regulations around pedigreed seed
[SPEAKER_15]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_15]: And while I personally may not be really
interested in a feminized auto flowering
[SPEAKER_15]: line, there are lots of corn farmers and
soybean farmers and wheat farmers that
[SPEAKER_15]: need those genetics need those pedigreed
seeds in mass by the time to be able to
[SPEAKER_15]: plant those crops and stop growing
unsustainable crops in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those a lot of those farming
realms have seed maps, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: different food, food farmers have seed
maps of what's grown where, because if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, say, a cabbage farmer,
you don't want to be downwind from a kale
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer or a broccoli or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you so you don't get cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it would be important for
us to develop seed maps within for sure
[SPEAKER_02]: the hemp realm, because hemp is easily
thrown around up here in Canada or in
[SPEAKER_02]: different realms as is it seed and fiber
hemp, which you would grow male and
[SPEAKER_02]: female, or is it medicinal hemp,
which you would grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all female for medicinal and there really
should be a different classification of
[SPEAKER_02]: that hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there, you know, there's talk
about that, but there really should be
[SPEAKER_02]: seed maps, because there's a huge level of
responsibility that comes from growing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because of its pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, it was a problem with
soybeans because of what happened with
[SPEAKER_02]: Percy's Percy Schmeiser and all that with,
you know, genetic pollen drift and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's it's something that
does require responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, and getting to
know our genetics better, so we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodites, because you could grow,
you know, 40 acres of feminized seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: there there is still pollen that can get
created in that field.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just walk away and plant,
you know, 40 acres of feminized seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: just guarantee that there's not going to
be some pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's some responsibility to
say, OK, you know, you can grow 40 acres
[SPEAKER_02]: of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't mean that because
you're a 40 acre hemp farm and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: machinery that you're not supposed to walk
the field still and to throw a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of a loop in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's everybody who's the home
grower and everybody in every circle has
[SPEAKER_01]: their four plants and guaranteed there's
going to be pollen all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pollen happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make a shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would piss a lot of people off,
but it would be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get together with the four plant
fam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to make sure everyone's
on board with with Canada and the four
[SPEAKER_08]: plants and with all the new growers out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even I was at the hydroponic store,
spent half the day there yesterday with
[SPEAKER_08]: all these new growers coming in and wonder
where they can get seeds, where they can
[SPEAKER_08]: get clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's their best way of growing?
[SPEAKER_08]: And and right now for for us, we're just
kind of putting people more towards like
[SPEAKER_08]: an autopilot system for so they don't
really go for feed or whatever like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to go towards.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, it comes down to a big thing
right now is about seeds, what you can
[SPEAKER_08]: actually get through the government right
now, which is through Alberti to buy some
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's lots of online seed companies
and people are buying seeds, want to know
[SPEAKER_08]: about feminized seed lines, want to know
what seeds to buy, what's going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: better for the condition and where did
they go to get this information?
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this whole new other industry
that people aren't even looking at right
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and I see it explosion in all the
local hydroponic stores of all the new
[SPEAKER_08]: novice growers who want to grow for the
ground more because they have this pain or
[SPEAKER_08]: they want to try this for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's just another real real
way of now educating people on how to grow
[SPEAKER_08]: their own four plants in Canada and really
get into how they can get up every day and
[SPEAKER_08]: help them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no doubt, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And four plants in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, countries all over the world are
starting to allow four plants and people
[SPEAKER_02]: are really coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been learning about the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made our hemp oil with medicinal
mushrooms for a lot of years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've worked with families that have
had to continue buying medicine from from
[SPEAKER_02]: the hospital in order to not be red
flagged by the medical industry and then
[SPEAKER_02]: just stop using that medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just kept buying it because they
just didn't want to be a red flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were able to cure themselves
through through this medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a really powerful medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do feel like we have this knowledge,
you know, a hundred years ago in the
[SPEAKER_02]: eighteen hundreds, you know, cannabis was
part of a lot of the medicines and hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: was used in agriculture and as fodder for
animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was at a time when THC hadn't
been bred into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a wider spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was a general more health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that and I really do wonder if
as they were starting to control plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and create industrial farming with
synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the plant being such a fractal
medicine, such a changeable medicine is I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that's what's good for our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when you when you're a
patient, you want to have the same strain
[SPEAKER_02]: because you want to have the same effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that that you can it's
sometimes a little bit of variation with
[SPEAKER_02]: that, with with similar strains can be
really positive to your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes having the same thing over
and over isn't necessarily something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's good for longevity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant has shown us that a bit
changes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's probably a point
of health to that that we might want to
[SPEAKER_02]: embrace and and not need to like control
certain aspects or certain breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you know, we're interested in
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically just flooding the
cannabinoid system, you know, our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system with all different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do understand isolating and I do
understand, you know, the distillate,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that and patients being able to use
that, but also being able to flood the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system with with all
different forms of medicine, whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're smoking it, you're vaping it,
you're eating it, you're using it
[SPEAKER_01]: rectally, you're using it on your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all really important things that
I think that we need to do to better our
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and what Josh was saying is that the
plant is always mutating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always changing, not mutating,
but it's always transitioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always in a form of evolution and
evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it changes a lot of its cannabinoid
ratios and terpene ratios with different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas that it's growing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can follow that lead of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and she can teach us so much in that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, nature's chemist, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's such a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also need to make sure that,
you know, we we have consistent medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the one of the situations that we
always run into just being patients going
[SPEAKER_13]: into dispensary is that you can't always
find hard of one and you can't always find
[SPEAKER_13]: a chem dog.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't always find this specific
strains that you're wanting to that,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, make your headache go away or
make your hit like his Crohn's health.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we we also need consistency in
genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to keep continuing to make new
cultivars and and and and have new
[SPEAKER_13]: products.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also need to have consistency.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, if somebody would just keep
keep keep growing a harlequin or or a sour
[SPEAKER_13]: tsunami, then we would be so happy because
it's a consistent medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that part of the evolution and finding
new strains, you know, where we know is
[SPEAKER_02]: the evolution of different medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you find it is really
important, you know, to continue that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is incredible power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And four plants and learning from somebody
who's cultivated for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get a tremendous amount of weight
off of four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we're really encouraging
home growers to find the medicine that's
[SPEAKER_01]: good for them, get the strains that works
for them and make their own medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: because then that's going to be able to
give us a greater education in being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to commune with the plant and understand
what it gives us and what it means to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to make medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that, you know,
I agree with you that we absolutely need
[SPEAKER_01]: to find, you know, solid lines for what
works with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's going to happen, too,
through people growing their four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd almost have to say, oh,
then you have to clone them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sometimes keeping clones alive is a
hard thing to do as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we're going to seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we have seeds, then there's a
little bit of variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, from a farming perspective,
we have to kind of weigh that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do we want to have a clone farm
for consistent medicine because it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: so much sense in your getting what you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's, you know, different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there can be pathogens or different
things that come with clone farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we if I think if we can find a
really stable seed line that gives us
[SPEAKER_02]: chemovars that are really close to what
you want, I think as a farmer and
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's better for the,
you know, for our evolution, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be an ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think showing farmers how to grow
those.
[SPEAKER_15]: Farmers and patients need access.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in states like Illinois, they can't
home grow is difficult.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not allowed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Homegrown is not just difficult as as a
state regulated process, because homegrown
[SPEAKER_13]: in the state of Illinois is is going to
come.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is going to be ridiculously
overregulated.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to have somebody come into
our home and check our plants and check
[SPEAKER_13]: where it's going.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where where we're growing it and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now we have a police officer in our
house, which is total.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another conversation altogether.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have four children and I have and
he's extremely busy all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we own a business and we have other
children that are off doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: things.
[SPEAKER_13]: So so having a home grow is very,
very difficult, especially in the state of
[SPEAKER_13]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_13]: If homegrown passes, because you can't
have your neighbor come over and water
[SPEAKER_13]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So homegrown, even though I completely
support it and I want and I would love to
[SPEAKER_13]: homegrown because I like.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: I suck at it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would like to do it and at least
have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Homegrown can be very difficult for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And homegrown is very difficult for a paid
for a mom who is a single mom who has a
[SPEAKER_13]: disabled child.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're they're doing enough as it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really have to, you know,
depend on the growers and the cultivation
[SPEAKER_13]: system, you know, the commercial
cultivation system, because we we don't
[SPEAKER_13]: have the time and effort and energies to
be able to do that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a really
interesting frame here when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: both trying to create really well
regulated, consistent medicine and plants
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as when we've got when we're
trying to get that kind of real variance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and like you were talking about that,
the variety of cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles that naturally evolves and gives
us that diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like we're eating nutritional
analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we're eating the same foods
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got diversity in the diet and
diversity in what we're taking in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid wise and terpene wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: In both of these cases, a huge piece of
this comes down to the epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking so much about the
genotype and and that we've talked about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that environment plus growing,
combining with genotype, getting that
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype expression and really so much
variance on that epigenetic expression
[SPEAKER_03]: based on everything from the microbiome in
the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the soil, to the nutrients,
to the environment, all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could take, you know, one genotype and
seed source or even clones, grow them in
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get totally different, different
cannabinoid and terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think in addition to really
emphasizing the cultivating the genotypes
[SPEAKER_03]: and those really good genetics,
which I think is so crucial, I agree
[SPEAKER_03]: completely really developing and refining
how we're supporting, regulating that
[SPEAKER_03]: epigenetic side of it, both for,
you know, we're trying to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically for really consistent
profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really important for that,
as well as when we're trying to get that
[SPEAKER_03]: real diversity that's going to allow us to
get those different, essentially cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients, different cannabinoids and
terpenes and that kind of thing for that
[SPEAKER_03]: variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just such a crucial piece to
really have in play.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: The polymorphic aspect that you're
speaking on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Super well said.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm at a loss for words.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you Peter's friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, who the fuck is this dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of them apples?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, well, welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate everyone on the panel today
for coming in and sharing your time and
[SPEAKER_06]: having these conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss it on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Wendy said, I have to sort of back
Wendy up too on the like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that utopian, like everyone should grow
their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to put you on mic mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, you're banging around there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an amazing idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen, you know, guys like Johnny
be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's, there's people that can
do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I myself have a 98 plant license.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't grown a plant in probably over
two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just too busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't lay it on my wife who is caring
for three children at any given time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fair to her.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that easy for everyone to grow
their own earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like it's not easy for everyone to
have their own gardens and grow their own
[SPEAKER_06]: veggies and make their own clothes are
growing up soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they might be able to help in
the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the idea of having a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, but even at this point
in my life, had I, if I had a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_06]: behind my house with cannabis and food
growing in it, I'd have to have someone to
[SPEAKER_06]: help do that work because I'm just,
I travel too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go, these things require attention and
they require love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they, what they don't require is like
five and seven and 10 day trips.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like during the most important,
like, you know, like, okay, I've,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've ventured them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're three weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, Ooh, like week four,
five, six, I just, I've played it out too
[SPEAKER_06]: many times and it's not that easy for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's one more reason why,
of course we need home grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need everyone to be able to grow their
own cannabis if they so choose.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the flip side of things,
we have to understand there's a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: group of people who are unable to grow
their own cannabis for a variety of
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they need to have access to both the
full spectrums, the plants, the extracts,
[SPEAKER_06]: the isolates, everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like don't anyone think that their opinion
is better and bigger than having access to
[SPEAKER_06]: everything for everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the answer to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Access for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all of those different ways of,
of extraction, and of caring and of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, just do it socially and,
and ecologically responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, that then we've got it
all the way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that note, I've got this really
nice Burmese hash out from Whistler that
[SPEAKER_02]: our friends brought out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got to give like some love to
the, the old school hash making Whistler
[SPEAKER_02]: family there that this is like super dank
and, and really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this Burmese strain is like really
sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super earthy and loving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the Burmese fucking incredible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's, I'm going to tell you,
it's, it's, it's super amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also this, this ice wook, big up to
the ice wook, ganja gill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this, this skittles gelato right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, I mean like it's time to
take it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I got some, I got some tropical
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tropical cookies hash rosin from,
uh, from, uh, heavenly days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he also gave me a tiny little bit
of, I got to find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Show and tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the other one?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the other one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's show and tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's the best part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was a Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny B on the bottom of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I talked to Ro you're making a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have tropical cookies and Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I meant to tell you that earlier
that because I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: you gave Johnny B the skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I don't have any skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave Johnny B the tropical cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the special K.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the stuff after the accident that
kept me on the coach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be very much right up your
alley.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really, and that's the biggest
thing about extractions and stuff like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really looking at that as I was really
grateful to actually come across and
[SPEAKER_08]: getting some really sedating, really good
Indica hardcore concentrates.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten an accident, which a few
people know a couple of weeks ago and that
[SPEAKER_11]: was accident 17.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but, uh, I mean, it's right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I needed that harsh sedation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I needed that, that really, really good
effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it came to me just like perfect
timing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the uplifting as I'm kind of
getting out of bed now, I'll feel a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit better to kind of get you going and
understanding your medicine and how it
[SPEAKER_08]: works is, is, is another great experience
and education for yourself and really
[SPEAKER_08]: paying attention to what you use every day
and how it works within you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just, you know, as people know,
it kind of gets me going every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis mantis says never drive with
John.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was rear ended.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: By somebody who's texting and driving the
C four where my surprise, that was that
[SPEAKER_08]: major surgery.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in rear ended again by some idiot
who made a left-hand turn when it said no
[SPEAKER_08]: left-hand turn and rear ended me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once again, I'm driving to an
intersection where it's a flashing
[SPEAKER_08]: pedestrian crosswalk and that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as light turns red, some guy handles
me at full speed doing a turn and a T
[SPEAKER_08]: bone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all three accidents were never my
fault, but I'd be driving.
[SPEAKER_07]: So repeat, never drive John.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, I mean, I've only used
cannabis before my accident.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did it before my, before my injuries.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I came out of my surgery,
Mark showed up with 50 different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point, I really realized how much
really took my pain away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a really important effect
that really took me to that different,
[SPEAKER_08]: really educational for me to take a look
at how terpenes and then take a look at a
[SPEAKER_08]: moisture content and keeping that AW,
which we're going to talk more about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know in the, in the future here,
cause I'm talking to Mark a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: about active water and both
standardization and keeping cannabis fresh
[SPEAKER_08]: for pain control and for other things
where you're looking at that same terpene,
[SPEAKER_08]: same freshness.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when something dries out, you're not
getting that same effect, but when it's
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of fresh, you get that really nice
effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And well here in Canada, all this is
produced is something really dry,
[SPEAKER_08]: unstandardized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's a really big,
it's a crisis in my opinion, because
[SPEAKER_08]: they're getting nothing that's going to be
effective for me on the legal market yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping to see, I think you'll be
an extract guy once that comes out in
[SPEAKER_06]: October.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine you doing too much flower
anymore when you can just buy the extract
[SPEAKER_06]: and the, that same act of water won't
affect the extracts nearly as much as it
[SPEAKER_06]: extracts the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny's been going deep down the rabbit
hole of active water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost always want to call it active
water content, but I have been schooled
[SPEAKER_06]: and educated that that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny's been talking to one of the main
scientists at Boveda, who was the guy who
[SPEAKER_06]: designed and developed a lot of the Boveda
packs for different moisture contents and
[SPEAKER_06]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he, he taught John about active water
and then John got a machine and he's,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's been doing these tests and it,
it's a pretty important work.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, once again, you can go write a
bloody PhD on any aspect of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, now you've got companies
that are unable to secure the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: seal it properly in a container.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they are sealing it properly,
what are they sealing it with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a glue and is that glue affected by
the gassing off of the terpenes within the
[SPEAKER_06]: package that now eats that glue,
pops the package, allows oxygen to come in
[SPEAKER_06]: and have it all mix up together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is quite a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnny's going deep down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably end up having a hash church
about it one of these days, but he's got a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of videos, little snippets on his
channel at John H Perfello.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to do a video on bubble
man's world in the next couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_06]: hopefully where we go and get a really
good overall view of this, what it is,
[SPEAKER_06]: this active water, you know, which is
basically the moisture content within the
[SPEAKER_06]: flower, but also the moisture content in
and around the flower within the package
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's within.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty important as John has been
learning, you know, to give you an idea,
[SPEAKER_06]: what is it like in the, in the high
twenties and that shit turns to,
[SPEAKER_06]: to dust John.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: 28, 29 breadcrumbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: AW was set at 30, pasta is 50.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the cannabis I'm testing is
between 29 and 46.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do you think it should be?
[SPEAKER_08]: 55 to 60?
[SPEAKER_08]: 55 to 58.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think seems to be what the U S
government and I've heard some little
[SPEAKER_08]: things that are key coming from
governments and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: 58 seems to be that AW reading that seems
to be at a safe zone where anything at 64
[SPEAKER_08]: and 65 we know 65 causes more these molds,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: 62 is kind of people a little scared of
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the 58 and I'm seeing that more
with the people that I'm kind of more or
[SPEAKER_08]: less consulting with and talking with and
trying to get people on that 58%.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's, there's going to be things I
really want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to talk about it on just you
and me, Mark and do a whole section on it
[SPEAKER_08]: and then probably come back with Ash
Church after and get more really deep into
[SPEAKER_08]: it and talk more about it because
something has to be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we get that, I think it's going
to set a real standardization for just not
[SPEAKER_08]: just here in Canada, but for around the
world of being able to standardize
[SPEAKER_08]: different strains, different products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm seeing it huge for me because I've
been fighting that standardization by deep
[SPEAKER_08]: carboxylating with Dr. Hornby to try to
standardize my girl with using a one part
[SPEAKER_08]: grown bloom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it come down all to the end,
it really came down to AW.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really started feeling that that keeping
this fresh all the time at a certain
[SPEAKER_08]: moisture level really plays a key role in
being able to get that same feeling all
[SPEAKER_08]: the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that your Jaro Nugs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of, this is, yeah,
this is, this is just, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it's, it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, if I can only share this with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that flowers dry out faster
or, or differently based off different
[SPEAKER_02]: growing styles, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say like a soil-less medium or a rock wool
aeroponic or a super deep living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on, on how those
flowers cure?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it because I did some soil
testing years and years ago and I found
[SPEAKER_08]: the more airier stuff kind of dried up
quicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was when I was just using a pure
cocoa to be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, but I was seeing this difference with
heat than I did different soil mixtures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's just pro mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like an amendment of cocoa and
something else.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really comes down to is, is,
is the, but if it's, it's a team,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's more area.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to cure differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's more indicated in the heart,
it's cured differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing a different, just in,
in packaging and just saying if I say,
[SPEAKER_08]: I normally used to package my cannabis to
say 62 to 60%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that AW is actually 50 to 52 inside
a container.
[SPEAKER_08]: So right there, I can tell you what
problems is are packaging without using
[SPEAKER_08]: controlled rooms across Canada by testing
all the LP weed right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just by testing it, I already know what
problems is coming from, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's all these little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, gut feeling is,
you know, that, that, that more
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganisms you have in your
rhizosphere and the more five,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, fungal filaments and fine
filaments that are activated with minerals
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff that it's going to, it's going
to create better waxes and better
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome, you know, cellular walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to affect the gases and
the off gassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I know a lot of farmers that,
you know, and hash makers that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, will hang their plants up in a
controlled environment, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for three, three weeks, you know,
four weeks and, and some weed that would
[SPEAKER_02]: dry out too fast, you know, and it would
just get crumbly and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I'm just, I would, that's something
that we like to see more information on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, the difference on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're, we're testing on a couple of
points here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, there is a lot of evidence looking at
the symbiotic relationship between the
[SPEAKER_15]: soil microbiota, uh, because of the soil
microbiota, uh, bacteria will actually
[SPEAKER_15]: provide nutrients, mine nutrients out of
the, the minerals, as well as create
[SPEAKER_15]: terpene precursors.
[SPEAKER_15]: And through a symbiotic exchange for
glucose, uh, provide minerals,
[SPEAKER_15]: as well as terpenes and other nutrients to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, having a more diverse soil
microbiota is going to produce,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, more terp, greater terpene contents in
cannabis varieties.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would, I would hypothesize that
different microbial, uh, bacteria are
[SPEAKER_15]: going to be provided.
[SPEAKER_15]: Providing different nutrients based on
their role in the soil ecology.
[SPEAKER_15]: But on top of that, you know, there's,
there is some, quite a bit of published
[SPEAKER_15]: research looking at silica content.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, silica content is going, is oftentimes
absorbed by the plants and then used in
[SPEAKER_15]: building cell walls.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and same with calcium magnesium,
uh, magnesium more for chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_15]: production.
[SPEAKER_15]: So low magnesium soils are going to have
less chlorophyll less that you have to
[SPEAKER_15]: cure out.
[SPEAKER_15]: High silica soils are going to create more
woody stocks, but also have thicker cell
[SPEAKER_15]: walls.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and then, so there is going to be,
we see that the same thing with grapes,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, growing grapes in different,
uh, Appalachias or terroirs are going to
[SPEAKER_15]: produce slightly different notes based on
mineral content of the soil, bacteria in
[SPEAKER_15]: the soil and even growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, even the plant has its own
microbiome, which is called the endophytic
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that when we look at,
um, say the yew tree, we, there was taxol
[SPEAKER_01]: that was coming from the yew tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they realized was that the
cambium layer within the yew tree,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was actually the endophytes that were
creating that taxol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're really interested in is the
interior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they were interacting to make it
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that this is a medicinal plant
with just seven, several different
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities within its cannabinoid
ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really interested in the endophytic
reaction within the plant that is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: creating the medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that, you know,
it is, is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that you're going to
get through soil diversity and through
[SPEAKER_01]: micro healthy microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk a lot about, you know,
the, the microbiome within the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to talk about how
that relates to the microbiome actually
[SPEAKER_01]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and this is, this is so huge
because what we've seen and we're,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, our sort of group and company is
very much involved in hemp specific and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis specific, it's all cannabis,
but, um, microbiology that really benefits
[SPEAKER_03]: and supports oil production as well as
overall, you know, plant health.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really our area where we love to
geek out on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we've seen both when,
when you've got really that kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: specific biology in the soil, how it
interacts with the biology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with its internal microbiome and what
that does to oil production and terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: production in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen stronger trichome actual
formation structurally with lower rates of
[SPEAKER_03]: decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you've got, when it's still on the
flower, you know, when we've, when we've
[SPEAKER_03]: got the right biology in the soil and in
the rhizosphere and how it's, how it's
[SPEAKER_03]: interacting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both how that relates to the drying out
effect, you know, and those increased
[SPEAKER_03]: resident oil levels, like you were saying,
the waxes and lipids as well as all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those different components.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that to be really significant for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, also speaking to the silica,
we've actually found there to be about
[SPEAKER_03]: four key pillars is sort of our feeling in
the soil to really get those highest oil
[SPEAKER_03]: contents, which I think have a big factor
also on that drying out approach,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also just quality and everything we've
been talking about in terms of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: those different major quality pieces and,
and, um, how, how things dry and result as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one of those, the first
that we really found is that first pillar
[SPEAKER_03]: is definitely that hemp specific or
cannabis specific microbiology in the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: and with good diversity at high
populations is just crucial both because
[SPEAKER_03]: of everything from the nutrient,
you know, availability and absorption,
[SPEAKER_03]: solubilizing, solubilizing, mobilizing,
chelating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and as well as really that
comprehensive root health, but also like
[SPEAKER_03]: you were saying that stimulating with
their secondary metabolism, their
[SPEAKER_03]: electrolytes, a lot of those biosynthetic
pathways that are actually going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulating those synthase enzyme
production for cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: and providing those precursors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that that's, we found that to be really
crucial for increased oil production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then combined with that, having,
you know, the right carbon levels in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil in the right forms, sort of in that,
that second pillar, because we need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to feed the biology, not just from
the, you know, the root exudates,
[SPEAKER_03]: the glucose that they're naturally
producing out, but also having immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: available food sources and slower release
kind of habitats for the carbon in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you've got that, the
microbiology, you've just seen whole other
[SPEAKER_03]: levels of biological activity,
which then are stimulating the plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: all these different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you combine that with, you know,
those right macro micronutrients at each
[SPEAKER_03]: developmental stage of the plant,
combine that with having all those broad
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum trace minerals, like you're
saying the silica and a lot of these other
[SPEAKER_03]: ones that we won't even normally talk
about as micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got all four of those pillars
really dialed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we've just been seeing really
incredible oil production and just
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible terpene and cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sort of developed our whole system
around optimizing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think your root mass is your
stomach, the stomach of the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the better the roots, the better the
fruits.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bigger the roots, the bigger the
fruits.
[SPEAKER_17]: And are you sequester, are you working on
sequestering some of this carbon in carbon
[SPEAKER_17]: capturing that?
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something I've been extremely
studying for quite some time and I'm very
[SPEAKER_17]: interested in that realm.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things, I mean,
when you've got high levels of beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: biology, those saprophytes that are,
you know, carbon eaters in your soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: as they eat that, you know, those exudates
and other things.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their necromass really helps to sort
of bind and hold a lot of that carbon in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found that to be really supportive
on that front as well, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like what you guys are doing over there
at Soil Balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always enjoyed having Peter on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to have you on and discussing
and just doing the work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, it's not always something
that's so easy to do without the
[SPEAKER_06]: structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of a company, you know, that's what that's
generally what we work under, like unless
[SPEAKER_06]: you're like independently wealthy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's breaking up on us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems to be the thing today.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, I've used the Soil Balance
Pro, I mean, your stuff there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also trying this one that's a Dr. Mary
Jane's Plant Probiotics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give it a shot because I'm just kind
of curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I saw so much action in my soils that
I've actually had to like feed so much
[SPEAKER_08]: more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people don't see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've tried to mold them like I've just
because I'm always just kind of curious
[SPEAKER_08]: and what's working and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the one thing a lot of people
that I'm seeing is I'm constantly trying
[SPEAKER_08]: getting more into using these plant soil
bases and getting more into looking at the
[SPEAKER_08]: root zones more and more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I'm actually increasing all my more
activity in my soils, I am seeing
[SPEAKER_08]: different plant locals and stuff like that
and have to change my nutrients right
[SPEAKER_08]: away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, whoa, slow down and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of people have to really take a
look at that, too, for beginner growers
[SPEAKER_08]: and like people like myself before for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I start using some of these new soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the beginning, I didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that I'm seeing that, oh,
yeah, I got to feed more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm used to seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm bumping it up because there's just so
much more activity going on and realizing
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually developed because we saw
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got such heterogeneous soils and
having the beneficial biology is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's these other pillars,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Having the right carbon levels,
having the right macromicros in the trace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we actually did was because it
can be so challenging, like Mark,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you were saying, to get all that
stuff tiled in if you don't have that
[SPEAKER_03]: budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually developed a whole system where
we've got those cannabis and have specific
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial microbes that are stimulating
oil production and getting that boost in
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we combined it with specific soil
testing and bi-weekly leaf tissue and sap
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis so that we're actually able to
check.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing like a CO2 and an H2O soil
analysis right off the bat to check what
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients are currently plant available
and which ones are still locked up in
[SPEAKER_03]: reserve so that we can actually start
really getting precise and tracking what
[SPEAKER_03]: that nutrient cycling is going to be like
in a really highly biologically active
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you get the bi-weekly leaf
tissue and sap analysis, then you can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually track what's an excess
deficiency, not just at current time at
[SPEAKER_03]: each stage, but what will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's so cool about the sap
analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to catch deficiencies and
excesses two to three weeks out before
[SPEAKER_03]: they show up as symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before they reduce yield, profiles,
potency, and get all of those things
[SPEAKER_03]: optimized.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so crucial for a highly
biologically active soil, like you were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, John and V, because when you get
that increased nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to be able to adjust both the
macro micronutrients, make sure you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: the carbon in the right forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you combine all these testing
that we've got in the system, you can make
[SPEAKER_03]: the fertility recommendations to go with
that really high levels of beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we've seen, just that mind
blowing ecogenetic expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like taking whatever that genotype is
capable of and really optimizing and
[SPEAKER_03]: amplifying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we've been putting together
to support growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you been working on different types
of mediums?
[SPEAKER_17]: For instance, cocoa versus just soil
versus rockwool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Every medium holds nutrients in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cocoa holds certain things.
[SPEAKER_17]: It holds things back and soil lets certain
things through.
[SPEAKER_17]: So have you worked on the dynamics of that
alone?
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you guys been focusing on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've been growing with growers
using a whole bunch of different mediums,
[SPEAKER_03]: both living soils, cocos, different
things, aeroponics, antroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's something we've been looking
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the reasons, again,
for all this precision testing that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of built into our system is because,
like you just said, there is no one size
[SPEAKER_03]: fits all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more we can really get precise and
helping each grower or farmer on a large
[SPEAKER_03]: or small scale, really dial in all of
those different pillars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we've just seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seen just the amazing results of both them
being able to grow the flour and the oil
[SPEAKER_03]: and the extracts that are going to be most
medicinal for the people who need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really exciting for us that
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what a great episode of Hash Church
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a solid three hours, like almost
without a break in conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I have to read what Sam said,
because he definitely wanted me to read
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was what he said was this week in
Colorado, the USA's first plant breeder
[SPEAKER_06]: rights for cannabis under UPOV were
applied for.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the alternative to plant patents
and is what fruit and veggie and flower
[SPEAKER_06]: plant breeders use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there, that's what he had said.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had heard most of what he had said when
he had mentioned that earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if you guys did, but there
you go, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're not in the room anymore,
but I did say what you wrote me,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe an hour and a half after you wrote
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I think I think things look good
to maybe continue the conversation next
[SPEAKER_06]: week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And get a little more deep into some of
these conversations and topics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as always, thank you all so much for
coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for for your perspective,
Beth, for sharing your perspective with us
[SPEAKER_06]: and coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks, Potent Ponics, Steve,
for for linking me up with you and send me
[SPEAKER_06]: your email and get me to invite you in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And always a pleasure, Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right back at you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your laughter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming out, dude, and hanging
out and sharing time with us and sharing a
[SPEAKER_06]: dialogue with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's your perspectives always
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do we do love having you here on
Hash Church and everyone else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. West, thank you so much for dropping
serious knowledge bombs today and just
[SPEAKER_06]: dropping in depth knowledge about
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just a fucking encyclopedia,
dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's completely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's something that I'm certainly
passionate about because we want we want
[SPEAKER_15]: to be able to create, you know,
create good corporate and ecologically
[SPEAKER_15]: social responsible companies.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, we want to be able
to assure that, you know, the community at
[SPEAKER_15]: large, the patients at large still
maintain access.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think, you know, I think there is a
need for for testing companies to develop,
[SPEAKER_15]: help breeders develop these lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a need for nurseries to help
distribute these lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in some regards, there's a need to be
able to develop rights or whatever,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, some commerce in those genetics.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we want to do it in a way that it
doesn't take away from the industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, the all the people on the
call, all the people watching it need to
[SPEAKER_15]: be able to understand and differentiate
and really support the the growers and
[SPEAKER_15]: breeders that aren't are trying to promote
safe access, not not trying to capitalize
[SPEAKER_15]: off of limited access, because there are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it in a nutshell right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make it fair and don't try to limit
access and control off limit access.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also hear the words of Sam,
you know, someone spends millions of
[SPEAKER_06]: dollars and there's Ph.D.'s are hired that
had to go to school for years to get their
[SPEAKER_06]: Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_06]: and the cost of the infrastructure,
the greenhouses and the breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if incredible work is done and novel
cannabinoid profiles are produced with
[SPEAKER_06]: unique novel terpene expression,
that we've never seen in the black market,
[SPEAKER_06]: like is it going to chat my ass if someone
somehow puts a plant breeder rights on
[SPEAKER_06]: that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably be more like the glass half
full guy, kind of like, wow, like they did
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of work to create something that
wasn't really readily available.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's going to be available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you might be able to buy it and lease
their their their cultivar or you'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to purchase the end product that's
sold through whatever companies they make
[SPEAKER_06]: the deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But people are always just like,
you know, it's the Internet nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the wild, wild west with the
keyboards.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just have strong personal opinions
they want to share about everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's crazy how fast you just make a
wrong statement in social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like everyone just attacks you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone, Colin and Jeff and Johnny B and
Skunkman Sam and the Turners who were here
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure I'm forgetting people,
Josh and Kelly, as always, D.E.M.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pierre and Josh, who came in early,
Dutch Blooms, who's doing the aquaponics
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming out and thanks all the
people who are watching and spent their
[SPEAKER_06]: Saturday morning or afternoon chilling out
with us for three hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will see you next week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make sure of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully some of these great people
will return.
