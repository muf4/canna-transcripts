[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man here with Flav421 and some of
his absolutely off-the-wall glass
[SPEAKER_04]: collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been trying to get together for at
least a few months to watch a good buddy
[SPEAKER_04]: of mine's documentary that he did on
glassblowing called Degenerate Art,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the art and culture of glass
pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as most of you already know,
Marbleslinger put this little masterpiece
[SPEAKER_04]: together over the last few years and I
cannot believe that I haven't watched it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Flav and I kind of made a promise and
we were like, oh we got to watch it with
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, like 50 grand worth of
glass and we'll puff the glass out of some
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing hash out of the glass while we're
watching the documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, I don't know, we've got a good
75k worth of glass sitting here in front
[SPEAKER_04]: of the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you want to give them a little
lowdown on what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a little part of the high
integrity glass collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Marcel Braun, Chris Carlson
crate collab.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's really the sought after
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all that hair trapping is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful with the cross sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a down stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work basket reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're moving over to some other ships.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the Flying Ball Rig by Jake
Seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely when you brought that over to
my place about a month back, I'd never
[SPEAKER_04]: seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, this was a really, this was
really, really, really popular when Jake
[SPEAKER_02]: put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very, very, very lucky to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roe from High Integrity really hooked this
one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the Jake Seed Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a Marcel Bull in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a Marcel Bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a Marcel Dale Somers Bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely blue ready lines with some hair
trapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice, nice dichrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flav knows me well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's many a dome in the house,
but all of these pieces today have hash
[SPEAKER_04]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm noticing the bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is a Dosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also mother ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a Corrie and Kalmo ready bowl on
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: This of course says, I'm sure a lot of you
do know is Leather and Lace.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last collaboration by Jason Lee and
Marcel Braun.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my personal, personal favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a spectacular piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the champion of my collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Fish 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some good history with that piece
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I spent a lot of time with Old Man
before Marcel went back down to Eugene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also spent New Year's at the Fish
Seminole Indian Reservation Show in
[SPEAKER_04]: Florida from 1999 to 2000 when Fish hit
the stage at midnight and played for seven
[SPEAKER_04]: and a half hours straight until the
sunrise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this piece, I wasn't there personally,
but I got some good stories from Marcel
[SPEAKER_04]: how this piece literally got sent out into
the crowd and it was just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: good vibes that brought it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, after six and a half hours made
it back to Marcel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Eric Crunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a diplomat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Simpson's Millies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of chaos going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some thumb prints on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I mostly brought the hash,
but I did bring my Nate Dizzle Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you gotta love the Swiss.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a gift from Nate when I took him
and Steve Hopps down to the Ruer Factory
[SPEAKER_04]: in Frankenthal, Germany to do a little
collab with those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both Steve and Nate gifted me a piece and
yeah, I can't tell you how much I've
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked out of this piece and I actually
brought this piece today because we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be using the tie nail sublimator
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got our titanium nail plugged in
right here and sitting and waiting to go
[SPEAKER_04]: and we won't be starting with it,
but we'll definitely be finishing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I guess thank you Marble Slinger
for sending me this copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm finally opening it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Slinger sent me this copy like
maybe like a year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the first copies off the
press.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of the first people that I knew
that had a copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, Degenerate Art, bitches!
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, pretty stoked on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: As some of you may know, Slinger and I did
an art show, two art shows actually
[SPEAKER_04]: together in my gallery back in 2002,
2003 I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first one was called Degenerate
Art, which Slinger had basically snagged
[SPEAKER_04]: from Hitler who created the Degenerate Art
movement in the late 30s, early 40s when
[SPEAKER_04]: he was trying to basically show art in a
negative way and degrade artists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Slinger and I borrowed that term for
this show, the Degenerate Art Show,
[SPEAKER_04]: which happened in 2002 and then 2003.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we did the Degenerate Art Show and
a couple of years later, Slinger put
[SPEAKER_04]: together the idea that he was going to do
this incredible documentary and that maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously, the glass scene has been
going for a while now and inspired by
[SPEAKER_04]: people like Snodgrass and other incredible
blowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just really happy to say that I know
these guys and that I'm really excited to
[SPEAKER_04]: throw this into the DVD player and start
watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll hit a bowl first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should start with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I agree with you, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Carlson Marcell is first on
the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds as good as any.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll just make sure we have some
B-line and a lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure we have some B-line over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice big spool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have B-line as well, but I saw you
had a spool there, so we'll spool down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ourselves a little skillet tool here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we start with the Seedsman Haze?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's always, always start with
the Sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something else in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember what it was,
but it's the Seedsman Haze that I'm basing
[SPEAKER_04]: this on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will light your B-line for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can drive it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll light it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: All this beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first rip of the session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said we were going to do $50,000
worth of glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we ended up with about $75,000 here,
so I think that's going to be a nice way
[SPEAKER_04]: to enjoy the degenerate art documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and you finished it like a champion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was about three hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loaded them just for you at home there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This little Marcel Carlson just hits so
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to smoke out of it on a few
occasions at the Treating Yourself event,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was a wonderful event in Toronto
last month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a month and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to smoke with it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to smoke with it with Marcel,
in fact, which is always a treat.
Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to meet Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super nice guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the glass blowers I had never met
before, but really stand up guy and
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously an incredible artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's to you two.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a lovely piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the little Marcel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the signellies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be taking our time today
during this little clip that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be smoking all these pieces
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to be watching this movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we'll probably do is throw it in
here soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pause the camera because I'm sure you guys
don't want to watch us watching the movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: But every time we take a hit, we'll turn
the camera on and we'll make sure we share
[SPEAKER_04]: it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you haven't watched Degenerate Art
yet, head over to Netflix and watch it
[SPEAKER_04]: with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we haven't started the movie yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were sitting here both thinking without
mentioning it that Slinger himself was not
[SPEAKER_04]: representing here, which is insane because
I have a ton of Slinger at my office in
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Flav has a little Slinger piece here
that he had gotten from a guy who got it
[SPEAKER_04]: from a guy who apparently got it from the
Degenerate Art Show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't personally remember this piece,
which is strange because I usually
[SPEAKER_04]: remember Slinger's pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely Slinger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that all over with the honeycomb
marble and the... He's got his sigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, his sigs and his little... They're
really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we start the movie, props to the
man himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marble Slinger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The man who got me into smoking glass
pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Used to smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long time ago, Slinger couldn't wrap his
head around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still can't wrap my head around stuffing
a bud into a bowl, but here's some hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lovely little bubbler.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to hit a Slinger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me loadeth you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me puffeth it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffeth it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffeth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Marble Slinger, thank you so much for
the piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a great representative of our
culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be nice to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely nice to see all this
glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice that someone out there is
documenting it because documenting is hard
[SPEAKER_04]: and you don't really realize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you pull back and you document,
it's almost as though you pull yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow away from the experience I found
that from taping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take yourself out of the experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm taping or doing photography or
recording, although I'm there more so than
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone, I'm also removed from the
experience because I'm usually looking
[SPEAKER_04]: through a lens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to capture the experience in
its purity which is very hard to do when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually a part of it because you
almost want to take it and make it your
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely when someone like Slinger
can show you the real culture and the
[SPEAKER_02]: history of the glass art movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's not wait another second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Push play on that flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we just watched the introduction
and maybe a little bit past that and
[SPEAKER_04]: killer editing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great start to the movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I think the intro is one of my
favorite parts of the movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all aspects of the movie but it's
just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's serene and really gets you into the
mood for what you're about to experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Flav's seen the movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just kind of got to the snot grass part
and I thought, wow, we should probably hit
[SPEAKER_04]: another fat piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go with the 8K.
[SPEAKER_02]: 8K, alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's load that 8K up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're showing the love with the OGs to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really quite heavy and you can't
really imagine how many millis there are
[SPEAKER_04]: in this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Burns, Wiggum, Lisa, Homer,
Otto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another shot of the Seedsman because you
can never have too much sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see Fish 2000 sitting on the
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of surreal.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a piece that years ago,
I'm pretty sure, I don't want to say this
[SPEAKER_04]: fact, but I'm pretty sure we brought
Marcel to his first fish show and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: up here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 9999.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Commodore Show.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was in 1993.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was some years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only met these guys in 98.
[SPEAKER_04]: By 99, Slinger had always gone to the most
fish shows, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had seen them, I'm sure, over a hundred
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more around the 30 to 40 range,
but at the time Marcel hadn't seen one and
[SPEAKER_04]: he came up and got really inspired.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one of his dolphin pieces and I
remember him just being there and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the guy that blew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone looked at Marcel and he just kind
of ran away.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just did not want that attention at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a whole crowd of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of an insane lot piece to pull
out, which was the Fish 99 number three,
[SPEAKER_04]: the smaller of the three.
[SPEAKER_04]: A year later he came up with this piece,
less than a year later he blew this piece
[SPEAKER_04]: and I remember his intention was to give
it to Fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted to have this in and if it
happened he was going to give it to them
[SPEAKER_04]: as a gift and that's why all the dolphins
represent the different members of the
[SPEAKER_04]: band.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got one, two, three, four dolphins,
which is the band.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the fifth one was Paul
Languedoc, the sound man, representative
[SPEAKER_04]: of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul is like the fifth member of the band.
[SPEAKER_04]: After the Fish 2000 show happened and all
these different people puffed out of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: he kept it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't go to Fish the way it was going
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he decided to clean it and bring it
up to Vancouver and be like, here man,
[SPEAKER_04]: the only vibe this pipe is missing is your
vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to take this piece everywhere,
to concerts, to my friend's head shops in
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a box with all the white peanut
things in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just used to cruise around with this
pipe because I felt like it was my
[SPEAKER_04]: mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like Marcel was like, you have
to...
[SPEAKER_04]: When he said it needs your vibe,
he meant like me and my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like me at home, just like,
oh yeah, look at this piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally shared it like the way he
shared it at Fish 2000 with anyone and
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, out of all glass pipes,
I've got to think this one has had more
[SPEAKER_04]: unique people that have never even hit a
head piece before hit that pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I was at the joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it called the joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, grassroots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blair's old shop on commercial drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at grassroots and I pulled this pipe
out and this guy, he was visiting from
[SPEAKER_04]: Illinois or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: He comes over to me and he's like,
where did you get that pipe?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, was that pipe at Fish 2000?
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd smoked out of it with Marcel or
without Marcel for all I know because
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcel put this pipe out into the air and
it was... Yeah, turned around for six and
[SPEAKER_04]: a half hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pipe has a very long history too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been to something like 15 different
states.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well Snodgrass is in his bus
and he's about to tell us about how he
[SPEAKER_04]: founded this incredible culture that has
grown exponentially since the days of
[SPEAKER_04]: making color, changing glass on Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taking another break because we need
another bowl, but this documentary is
[SPEAKER_04]: really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just watching the Jason Harris interview
that Slinger did talking about one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: first bobblers ever made on the Carlisle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The wrap and rake.
[SPEAKER_04]: The wrap and rake technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to say, I'm really digging this
documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking sad, us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be hitting a little
mothership now.
[SPEAKER_02]: J.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: playing ball right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, stepping it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little further back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The camera doesn't auto-focus as the
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look right there, they'll be able to see
the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I'll edit some shots in of close-ups
while we're talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to talk about the pipe,
I'll show close-ups in regards to every
[SPEAKER_04]: little piece you're talking about because
I've taken great photos of this piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: After you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a ridiculous pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that don't know,
there's like this flower of life,
[SPEAKER_04]: like laser perforated disc at the bottom
that all the bubbles come out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even see the holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as they come out, they get bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like five or six layers of
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes for a smooth, I'll say that,
makes for a real smooth hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a huge bowl, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mothership is really the best filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their pipes give the best tokes,
the smoothest tokes, the level of art on
[SPEAKER_02]: them is parallel to a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much none.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice base, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the base that you want to see on most
pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you're going to ever put
this pipe down and chip this base.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's built, but yet it's really
artistic and beautiful as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're taking our, I don't know
how many it's been, but we need another
[SPEAKER_04]: bong rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving to the Fishtube K after just
seeing it in the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that was a nice part of the
video.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that hardcore head pieces and the
headies, Alex from headies and Fishtour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met these guys originally in 95,
I met one of them well, two of them
[SPEAKER_04]: actually, Slinger and his older roommate,
Zach, who I met both on.
[SPEAKER_04]: One on Fishtour, one in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And three years later, while driving to
the Gorge shows in 98, I would pick up
[SPEAKER_04]: Marble Slinger hitchhiking and he was with
Jason Lee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I ended up partying with them on
the weekend and enjoying some great fish
[SPEAKER_04]: shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of my introduction into
meeting all those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great to see Pedro and Ease and
just so many of these different guys that
[SPEAKER_04]: Slinger used to bring up with him when
they were all in Bellingham before they
[SPEAKER_04]: moved to Seattle actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very cool to be puffing out of the Fish
2000 piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll hit another kind of hash,
something a little heavier.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little on the fish satellite?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong indica for the midway point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dingo dongo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fish 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: True piece of borosilicate art history
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_04]: True words, whatever you say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice to see my Marcel pieces in the
video there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To see Alex from Hetty's talking about
these pieces and the sculpture and the
[SPEAKER_04]: fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they showed the picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is indeed in my collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have many pieces these days,
but I do have a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Marcelles were made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three Marcelles in my collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's just a bit nicer.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a piece.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcel Fish 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Cypress.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at the Big Cypress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the way this piece sits.
[SPEAKER_04]: True coffee table piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Centerpiece piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hit the slinger.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hit the Marcel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carlson.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hit the Jake C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also hit the AK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we've hit the Fish 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more before we restart the movie,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do the dosa tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another mothership artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bought this off of High Integrity Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, High Integrity Glass is definitely
pulling out all the stops for the
[SPEAKER_04]: mothership here in BC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't personally own a mothership as of
yet, but I can see it happening one day
[SPEAKER_04]: soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They definitely hit unlike any other
piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like that they're not super loud,
as you can hear this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good sized hit.
Very.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Moses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get a double.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe how big it was,
because you literally took so much,
[SPEAKER_04]: twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still some in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's my bad or good on loading,
depending on how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I shall soon join my friend in the
land of the we just took a giant rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the feel of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the dosa's an amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even warrants a cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you don't cough, you don't get
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the movie?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're at a good part here,
so we're going to get back to the movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just finished the Degenerate Art
DVD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can definitely see the next part in the
news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the exponential growth
that they spoke about in the movie and how
[SPEAKER_04]: it'll be like probably in the next two to
three years, as much will have happened
[SPEAKER_04]: that happened in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you just follow what's going on
from month to month in the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even while we were watching that DVD and
smoking all these different bowls,
[SPEAKER_04]: some kid was pushing new limits in glass
pipe art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we'll be finishing off our session
here with the Jade Sea Faberge egg,
[SPEAKER_02]: Leather and Lace by Marcel Braun and Jason
Lee, and the Nate Dizzle with the
[SPEAKER_01]: sublimator attachment to complete the Hedy
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you, after you, sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I won't say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the base of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that the next movie will
be Regenerate Art after the shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: were put on by you and Slater?
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be hard to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely can see, like, I didn't even
realize it was the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so enamored by the whole movie that
it just kind of ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I realize now, seeing it now,
already some years have gone by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the latest footage is 2010,
2009 maybe, 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a treat to be able to come over
to Flabs and hit the glass collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I'd like to say I smoke the
heaviest of the glasses, I smoke nice
[SPEAKER_04]: glass, but really I smoke one or two
pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the variety like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really nice to be able to stop by
and hit the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what a collection it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like I said in the movie,
I'm a firm believer that this art should
[SPEAKER_02]: be in museums.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, you've been sticking bubble hash on
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, so yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always stick bubble hash on my pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, in fact, I'm sure I have some probably
on this one somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this piece is just, it's hard to
describe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be able to see it up close and
it's just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The staircase, the different discs with
the air drop reddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last collab that Jason and Marcel ever
did together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know if they're planning on doing
another one, not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got to hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved some of the big collabs too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can really see that growing in the near
future where it is five or six different
[SPEAKER_04]: artists putting together this monster
piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it exists already, but I'd like to
see it for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this pipe is kind of incredible for
one reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe they did it and I love
that they did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got this like just old school car on
the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it wasn't done in 2010,
it is a very, it's like everything about
[SPEAKER_02]: it is old school design.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel it, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to know too much about
these pieces that certain ones just feel a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just gives you such a massive rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to smoke it right handed even
though it is intended to hold with your
[SPEAKER_03]: left hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my faves.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these are my faves.
[SPEAKER_04]: When really they're the flakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there's a lot of people coming
up, are you Flav421?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but that's not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shall we move into a little
sublimation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think we could do a little
titanium nail on the Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always protect your glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one are you pulling out or putting
something away?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for a specific pelican which I
don't have on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious pelican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's bell layered.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you ready to finish it all off
with the glass?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've had a lot of nice different
filtrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of nice hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it will be nice now to hit the Swiss
Perk which is always, I mean, this is one
[SPEAKER_04]: of those pipes that I can hit without
water in it and not be like, oh stop and
[SPEAKER_04]: go put water in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hit it two, three times in a row
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Swiss, they give a special
filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 100% agree with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in the tie now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's after taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really good for taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you're rocking with that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It rocks you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: The taste really comes through with that
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely came through the most with
the sublimator, which I have to tell you,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same quite a bit for the unit because
A, all these beautiful pieces are all
[SPEAKER_04]: glass and that we love glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, I guess we didn't compare
it to hitting it with a hot rod or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is also extremely tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very tasty, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have one actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have one that you gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, well maybe this time,
maybe we're going to do another whole
[SPEAKER_04]: round and while we do, you guys just find
something else to watch on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: This video is over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out and great job, Slinger,
truly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
