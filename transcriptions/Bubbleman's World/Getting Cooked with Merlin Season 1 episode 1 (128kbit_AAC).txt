[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so you guys are in luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna get that last scene that I
spoke about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just headed over to Merlin's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Brixton is here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, look, you're a star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, back to the food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell me what you're prepping here,
bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna make some tagliatelle,
homemade whiter noodles with some wild
[SPEAKER_05]: mushrooms and sage butter from the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his pasta maker out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his fresh ball of pasta ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice silky pasta.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little mix of semolina flour and
regular 00 flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, lots of flour so it doesn't stick
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got some other prep over here,
Daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got the shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Onions and garlic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Onions and garlic and parm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how fun was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Picking shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all this fresh sage from the garden
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fresh sage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought a flatbread with a ball of fresh
mozzarella cheese and I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have sauce but I actually brought some
sauce too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured we could do a little starter
flatbread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll turn it on the oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the mushrooms, some mozzarella,
a little bit of garlic, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think what we're gonna do is we'll
fry all these mushrooms with the onion and
[SPEAKER_05]: the garlic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep them on the side and then mix it with
all the pasta with the sage butter is
[SPEAKER_05]: ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking a similar thing for the
pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would fry the mushrooms up with
some garlic and butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of that can go on top of the
pizza even in the last two minutes of
[SPEAKER_03]: baking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it melt into the cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just chilling out, making pasta.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are gonna do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready for me to serve you up a dab now
that you're home?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaning all my rigs this morning too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I clean mine every single time I take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love it though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Making a big meal is great but what
happens is you rush to get timing for
[SPEAKER_05]: everything ready at the exact same time
and then everyone stuffs themselves for 15
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes and dinner's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the courses are nice aren't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It adds to a dinner when you're with
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: You spend a few hours eating and drinking
instead of just eat, clean, done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh it's so nice man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting hungry just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice portions too.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many portions are you making?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be enough for three of
us.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Kim?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright Merlin just came down to grab some
thyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta love having a little herb garden
don't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Brixton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Brixton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brixton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanna play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanna jump?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanna play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanna jump?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanna play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go do food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go do food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Food.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's more important than food little
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He still thinks fun's more important than
food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chef has spoken.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said dabs it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today he's hitting dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that you were smoking joints the
other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kinda nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even now I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice that you have your own rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big responsibility that goes
into dabbing out all your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me it's not about dabbing the
beautiful hard to get hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the rig and cleaning all the work
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other day you sat there cleaning the
bottom for like an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four people were puffing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going in for some cold starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some strawberry banana in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gonna get some strawberry banana going
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other way to get it off to
stick to the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm breaking this all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a mess I'm making.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is like hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh get you prepped.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be your sous chef today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just tell me what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty nice of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always shouting out everyone for all
of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to find out what temperature you
brought that to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sitting at 500 right now,
which is a pretty good cold, like cool
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but to get litty lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this could possibly be the first of
many shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how you guys like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how much you like cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking and dabbing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you do, we've got more than a
few episodes of our sleeves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tasty, tasty goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID friendly puffing our own rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, we're also in the same
circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll help with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you heat it up a bit first with the
torch, and then pour that in, it'll melt
[SPEAKER_03]: it and pull it off, but it's going to put
it all on the sides of the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I usually just have one of these that I
just sit right there as it's doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't know how to clean the
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving him a man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Splaining to Merlin how to clean the
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: See men do it to each other too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not something we just do to
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies to all the females I've ever
done it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to break myself up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just told my girl that she had to clean
the banger properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were mansplaining it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim would never take that the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasty, tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, dabs are similar to a
multi-course meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, instead of having what would
really be a session where you're smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: joints and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have like a dab when you're like,
no, we'll try this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That won't come onto the, uh, come off
onto your dab or really nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still got a nice texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to butter out soon though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it'll pull out nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of pulling snappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another little cold start for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, it's hanging out in the tip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am style.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, I'll get the rest off for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Joint smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to do big dabs anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your style.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of small dab would be better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if what I, I, I don't know if
what I hit is small because most,
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly don't think that it's big
either, but it's not something I give to
[SPEAKER_03]: people that don't dab a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause even what you put in there,
it was a very, very little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but look how much it turned into when it,
when it expanded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just like little puffs like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That just tastes super good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not like your turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with the carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well you're getting first, just the
volatiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're kind of finishing it off
towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't have near the flavor,
but that's where all the strength will
[SPEAKER_03]: lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like cold starting, but I do prefer just
hitting it from the start to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can get it in one or two small pulls.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I mean, there's nothing
tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here than just hitting the turps first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always that first hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that first hit off a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always called it the King's hit or the
Queen's hit, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that was like, man, could you
imagine if the only hits you took were
[SPEAKER_03]: those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Always tasted like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just like, I'm the Queen,
King of England.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be smoking only first starts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially that's how dabs are though,
compared to joints, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a joint in comparison, the amount of
tokes that you get.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that first two or three tasty ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that it's like,
it's good, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, and I can even still hear people
like arguing with us in the comments right
[SPEAKER_03]: now because I do remember when I was
younger, at least thinking that some of
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit tasted good right down until it
was burning my fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you were lying to yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have been, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cognitive dissonance is definitely
interesting in how it creates our reality,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one we experience at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the guy in high school that was
always like, I like the taste of roaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a roach collection that was like
several pounds towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember I gave it away through a
friend that ended up giving it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember who got it, but they said
that those roaches lasted them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the person who got it was,
you know, someone who loved cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but didn't have a lot of money to spend on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was going to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just got fat roaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they were huge, fat, crazy hazes and
all like special.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like they might've looked like garbage
to most people, but that person really
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember them saying like,
I got two Christmases out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like celebration, like they were
celebrating like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 97, 98, and then by 99 hit,
I was just puffing only bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I could make this stuff, I was like,
are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've met you probably about four,
four years, five years ago now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that four years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't seen you smoking joint ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll smoke a hazel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a funny meme of myself on the guy's
body that leads the interesting life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Coors guy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, I may not always,
I was like, I don't always smoke joints,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when I do they're pure hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the world's most interesting man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you'd know.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, listen, I'm appropriately baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have one more rip here in a
second, but we're going to go make this
[SPEAKER_03]: food because really this whole video has
been about the inspiration of the last
[SPEAKER_03]: scene of putting the plates down and
showing you what can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see how we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to take Brixton for a walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to explore the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to discover new mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're going to eat, eat them and
enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the vegetarian way to eat what you
catch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forage.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Merlin has prepared pretty much
everything here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just kind of doing some finishing
touches and he's kind of going to walk us
[SPEAKER_03]: through how he's going to prepare this
dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to be the cameraman and
the voice behind the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cast iron pan.
Hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty heated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other day we were driving and you
told me your favorite line from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sopranos that you finally kind of got it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best line in Sopranos is Tony when he
says, Christopher, you'll understand the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance of good produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you get older and it's the best
line out of the entire series in my
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pepper up those embers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are getting close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now next step is we'll turn all the water
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get our pasta boiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got our tagliatelle there and then our
pizza as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's filming.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're filming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we'll get the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: About $60 worth of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one other time right here too.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the yellow mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just slice these ones up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I film with this Panasonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little 4K unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're filming for the channel right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just Merlin's to walking us through
the homemade pasta with the mushroom
[SPEAKER_03]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to move them much.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to get the water to stay inside
the mushroom rather than get the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: thing super soggy and put your garlic on
after.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once they're mixed in, don't move them
until they sear in for the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, you're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, don't worry, I'm growing it in
a plant out back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got one of those time plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let that sit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming along.
[SPEAKER_05]: Salt your water to taste like the sea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do this bread too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll create a bit of cheese for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make a mushroom sauce for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flat bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some mozzarella.
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point you can see the water kind
of bubbling out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really want to get all that moisture
out of the mushrooms so that they can
[SPEAKER_05]: caramelize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's steaming nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, it's steamed at the front of the
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I clean it well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the tagatelle, I guess we'll
just get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the water boiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a little salt in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, lots of salt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes like the sea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get the tagatelle in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be super quick and then
we'll cool it down to stop it from
[SPEAKER_05]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's super quick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like three, four minutes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, at the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want really nice heat and not really
move them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want them to stay like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely steaming less.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it bubbling out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the flavor getting back
into the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: You almost want to see onions starting to
caramelize before you start turning them.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going, oh, I'm steaming her up
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to get this food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pasta just came out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about three minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are still going hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the onions are starting to caramelize
and there's almost no more water bubbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely, certainly there is
moisture coming off of the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really want to cool your noodles off,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, so they're not still cooking in
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're ready to take those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, as much as I saw that as a
first turn, it really looked like a second
[SPEAKER_03]: or a third turn.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was first.
[SPEAKER_05]: First turns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we hit it with a bit of pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all looking quite well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chopped up a bit of garlic.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is good for the pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bit of ricotta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got some ricotta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bit of parm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parmesan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, by we, I mean you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bit of thyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you put parm in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garlic, thyme, olive oil, and a bit of
salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get that all in there nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be our sauce.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they've got some nice caramel on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's get over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowl them up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll take all the flavor that's
from in this pan and we'll start making
[SPEAKER_05]: our saved butter sauce for the pasta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there'll be a lot of that flavor in
the pan, won't there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much why you like cast iron?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's also consistency of heat is
the key to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since it's kind of like a sage butter,
tangy ray with some gin has a little piney
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get all that flavor up from the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Butter it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Butter it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then season these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we'll let this mount up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just mix up with all that flavor on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the gin and the butter and the
mushroom remnants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put that heat on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That smells so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's only got like two sage leaves in
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well then once we put all these in,
what happens is these are going to pull
[SPEAKER_05]: out all that incredible flavor,
but they also crisp up and turn into sage
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf chips, which are incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Candied sage leaf.
Buttered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buttered to perfection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just going to let this go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: A pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a flat bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we've got some pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheese on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Parmesan.
Not too much cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less is better on pizzas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Domino's.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll heat up the pan too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Best practice is to go heat making pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Preheat your pan.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way you get crispy dough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good advice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 500 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it in there for a good five,
10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heat it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just slide your pizza in on some
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little garlic in there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is looking pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You threw your clove of garlic in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little extra flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you break that or anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just crushed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I figured.
[SPEAKER_05]: Split.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're almost turning this to clarified
butter as you can see all that foam coming
[SPEAKER_05]: off.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the lactose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, if you cook butter down
enough and keep taking that foam off,
[SPEAKER_05]: it becomes the clarified butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor is starting to cap in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want your butter to be like a brown
butter, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it a bar noisette.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bar noisette?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, bar noisette.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bar noisette.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a fancy place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bar noisette.
[SPEAKER_05]: In noisettes because it gets a little
hazelnut flavor when you burn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice amount of olive oil on the side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crisp it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Concentrates the heat on those tips and
gives them a little darkening,
[SPEAKER_03]: huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it gets them nice and crispy too.
Drizzles.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's hot enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you a little?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, if you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: The key, don't lose heat in an oven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Making pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about done, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a little crispier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take the sage out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicate at this point, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's pretty much chips.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just hiding them there,
aren't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: After you can see the color of the butter,
it's nice and brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave those nice chunks of garlic here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a little extra.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to dose the pasta with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we take our pasta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flavor of the chanterelles,
the butter, the sage, the garlic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all getting up in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, you can smell those turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pine turps, they're hardcore.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is definitely an alpha pining dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's why I like sage so much is
its pining is so strong, it almost wakes
[SPEAKER_05]: you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like taking a bite out of a pine tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let those fry up for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Warm them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get our shrooms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now bring up the sage, piney, buttery
flavor into all of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the flavor of the woods, I suppose
you'd think of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the flavor of the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very blessed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now take some of this right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: See it's like chips now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Saving a few on the side for plating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez Louise, does that smell good?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm most impressed at how much
you're keeping in the pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like overfilling that pan but you
have a good control, good food control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two times is not spilling stuff,
it helps for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of parm added onto the pasta.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you want to evenly distribute
and homogenize each ingredient.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the way I'm cooking them separately
to keep their flavors intact.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never want to mix up mushrooms with
everything so you lose the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to do a plating.
[SPEAKER_03]: To do a plating did you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let's do some plating here.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of parsley to finish this
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's a great texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so you create a little parsley.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little dressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that for the garnish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't remember you cutting
any that were that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice size serving, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the mushroom plate after all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that was nice the way the mushrooms
dropped into the bottom for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the chef's plate right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick the shrooms out from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there oh so good?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice plates right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, did that thing unload?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the shrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go look at those under the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, we're gonna hit it with a bit of
parmesan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: As in you are.
Parsley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wiping the bowl up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the last thing I like,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more fresh peppy.
[SPEAKER_05]: One last little peppy or salty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude, I'm in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely stunning, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we kind of forgot about the
pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna try some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try some.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're just about to sit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beautiful pasta was just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe what a great job you did
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna take our first bites on camera
and then we're gonna leave you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the flatbread as well that came
out looking just perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushrooms melted right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: See chef's first bites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll those noodles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasty tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take my first bite on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks absolutely beautiful,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is some some some styley pasta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That parmesan is nice and salty.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many flavors going off on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coating my lips, that sage butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this video was inspirational.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Merlin for the exceptional
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do more of these, bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time for sure we'll do something
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say goodbye to everyone and kind of pull
us out of this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for following us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
