world I have been doing all sorts of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: things and I haven't been filming it So I
figured I'd give you guys another little
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of short intro into what we're
looking forward to While I take a nice dab
[SPEAKER_00]: of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have some nice little nugget past my
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is I don't know if I can get you guys
the close-up, but it's very nice Jamaican,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm gonna take pictures of it with the
macro lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a beautiful smell to it real
exotic There's this spice that I love in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain Jamaican herbs and this has it
this was given to me by my buddy sham
[SPEAKER_00]: Shamrock no So this herb was given to me
by my buddy Shadrock and Shadrock runs the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegan restaurant side side of the road And
it was funny because when I walked up to
[SPEAKER_00]: him and I told him who I was he said man
He said if it don't bubble it ain't worth
[SPEAKER_00]: the trouble and I said, how do you know
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said you showed my father Ras
roadie how to make bubble hash like 12 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years ago and I couldn't believe it It
was quite a trip to now realize how old I
[SPEAKER_00]: am that the people that are recognizing me
here are the sons and the daughters of the
[SPEAKER_00]: men and the women that I shared my
knowledge with Almost 15 years ago today.

say it's right on par with the with the

interview with Shadrock and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go over and show you his kitchen and show
you a little bit of his I tell food and

little bit because right now He's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: very few people producing true.

think is a fairly important thing when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're coming on a vacation to be able to
have access to the good food Not all this

know, most of the places are trying to

dabber carb cap that fits their halo this
