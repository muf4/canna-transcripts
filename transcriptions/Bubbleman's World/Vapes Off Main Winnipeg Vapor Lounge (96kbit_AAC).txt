[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so Kelly and I just made it to
downtown Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to actually have a hemp shop just
around the corner here called the Hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: Exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And can we fit through there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, well let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit dangerous, but let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put all my bags on the side so I'm not
touching any cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're heading over to Vapes Off Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it used to be Vapes On Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's Vapes Off Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to the left here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little Reggie the Rot.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That girl was sitting in cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just walked in.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no one in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And her back was to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you looking for someone?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddies must have went to a different
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they just left.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Cory turns around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen her in about a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's... Ow!
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was she working there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: The girl was just sitting in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was working?
[SPEAKER_06]: The girl that was working on all the
paper?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she was just sitting there writing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sat right beside her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she was just sitting in a booth
writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're heading in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I turn this off first?
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I put this wall up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Built this wall up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Service window in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this like a little dispensary right
here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this was going to be the... This is
where you pay your... When I built it,
[SPEAKER_06]: this was where you paid your admission.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got into the lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was going to be a bit of the
medical marijuana resource center side of
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I haven't been here in a long
time since they got it open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: ...smoking marijuana is not a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using drugs generally is not a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's asinine to hurt people more by
enforcing criminal law on people who smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana or use any drugs of that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, legalize, let's take them out
of the hands of the criminals and start
[SPEAKER_01]: making our streets safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your point is clear.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally turned the camera on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been sitting and talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at Vapes Off Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started as Vapes On Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Eddie from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was Eddie and Bill here who's
been involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eddie and Bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Eddie's wife, Leah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned about it through Bill from his
Facebook page, seeing him post about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I first saw the words Vapes On
Main, it got me excited because I'm from
[SPEAKER_05]: Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually haven't lived here in almost 20
years, but I thought definitely nice to
[SPEAKER_05]: see a vapor lounge here in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my hat's off to these guys for doing
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been sitting around this table,
puffing for the last hour or so and having
[SPEAKER_05]: good conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I just thought I would give you
guys from Bubble Man's World a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of a glimpse into Vapes Off Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we could go around the table and
everyone could kind of introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves and tell us a little bit about
your cannabis passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crazy how fast it went,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was here when everything started
with Eddie and Bill at the first main
[SPEAKER_00]: location, Vapes On Main.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really got like we started talking
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a post on 420 saying, hey,
we're opening a new cannabis manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a week after that, somebody from CBC
comes and asks to have an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, OK, sure, sure,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an interview with Bill and
Leon, the management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, in a week, we got
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like CTV, CBC, Winnipeg Free Press,
everybody doing their own reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I left a year ago, and now I come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a new place, downtown,
crazy things are happening around the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bill, do you think that the media was
interested in, do you think you having a
[SPEAKER_05]: history as a police officer in the city
and now being an outspoken cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: activist and really outspoken for the
plant, do you think that brought a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit of that media in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that part of the attention that they
were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it mean I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been speaking in the city for quite a
number of years now for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: For LEAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah, LEAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since over 70 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in my previous position,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the 1990s, and then I said,
to hell with that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard pulling for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already familiar with cannabis,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I grew up in the 60s, but it
wasn't something that I was forced to like
[SPEAKER_01]: to care less about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have a nose for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I essentially, you know,
I played in the water ball since I found
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to run off on both here and
take all the time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as vapes, a lot of mangos,
that was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be to Toronto, I'd be to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew Dana a few people I scored before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Johnny Tran and Leah Kant came with
Eddie, my host one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we met them at a demonstration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, we're looking for a
director to set up a private club.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I had heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started out as a private club.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called social clubs in the
province.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're private.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured it was a good opportunity to
give the cast simply by getting in,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've already been so active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought I'd be remiss if I didn't
get in to simply, you know, not give my
[SPEAKER_01]: sanction to it so much as saying,
hey, I'm with the people here on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the kind of game we need in this
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dispensary, they're going to be next.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vice from the magazine came out to do
an interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it went quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's slowly just grown into the entity
that it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're here because the location is
kind of a bohemian beatnik hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking dating myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over here is Exchange District Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just went through the reggae
festival here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great new spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just a brand new spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally where we had our spot 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hemp exchange, like right in the
exchange.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a poutine place now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a poutine place now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we smoked a lot of weed and hash in
that building, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of weed and hash got smoked in that
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like Bill said, things really took
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just heard of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they put out that newspaper thing,
they kind of put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things repressed around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my position, I mean, I don't
understand you so well personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: As some of my friends are here in the
medical aspects and the intricacies of the
[SPEAKER_01]: findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that much into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a crime guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen people stop this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a crime anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these drugs that, because they're
not regulated or legal, that they're able
[SPEAKER_05]: to, other people can just take control of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm the lead on that issue,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta take control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, cannabis is considered part
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people don't understand that most of
the cannabis growers now are mums and pops
[SPEAKER_01]: and more in the professional growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't deal with their products and
other drugs, simply cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the big difference in my view.
[SPEAKER_01]: I support the cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't support the other drugs,
but I say let's legalize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like common sense, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already know what prohibition did
because back in the day of alcohol
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibitions, and it was the police force
who really took a serious look at
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibition when, for the first time in
the history, people just started literally
[SPEAKER_05]: killing the police.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was under prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of a sudden, it was a war.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were shooting each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were shooting each other for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, well, this is insane
considering most of those policemen drank
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol in their time off, even under
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still went to the speakeasies or the
whatevers and ended up having a drink or
[SPEAKER_05]: two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's like, they realized way back
then that eliminating alcohol prohibition
[SPEAKER_05]: would eliminate all the crime that went
along with it and just regulate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all those old people that were
smugglers and bootleggers are now the
[SPEAKER_05]: biggest alcohol companies on the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally like the Bronfman.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally it's rumored that Al Capone
might have been down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would have been filled up with
alcohol barrels at one point.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just hanging out at Al's place here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a historical place for prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where David Melovin comes in handy,
because that's what he does.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would literally hear that story,
and then he would figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would just follow it and find it and
follow the history and then make it
[SPEAKER_05]: available in some cool little book or
piece of paper or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people should look at that guy in
regards to his activism.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's portrayed himself over the course of
the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's hardcore, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I firmly stand behind David Melovin in
most of the things that he does,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis activism related.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember we were going to Switzerland
when we went to Melovin's place and they
[SPEAKER_06]: were arguing about something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when we were leaving, you were
saying, that was David Melovin.
[SPEAKER_06]: What dude from Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_06]: The raw guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Him and his girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Chris Iverson.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so funny, but then what blew my
mind was Bill Smalls blew my mind there
[SPEAKER_06]: because he was playing the Reefer song.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Reefer song?
[SPEAKER_06]: Viper?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Viper, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In his bedroom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen a joint nine feet long
or something like that?
Yeah, something.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Reefer boat joint five feet long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five feet long.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're a Viper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to that bond.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some old school like 30s or 40s style
music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know he was a pro musician.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to continue to puff ourselves
into a frenzy here, but thanks for
[SPEAKER_05]: watching guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you the story,
even Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably didn't know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walt was arrested by Mark Emery when he
was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, it was only because I was
an intelligence unit at that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was kind of straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did surveillance anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surveillance?
[SPEAKER_01]: When he was in Winnipeg on a demonstration
outside the public safety building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he got arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got arrested.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took his bong, his Vancouver Canucks
bong, and he still talks about that bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: He still wants that bong back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a guy sitting there kind of watching
and saying, because I was ordered to go
[SPEAKER_01]: over and have a little bit of a watch,
and I knew he wanted to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: In his defense, he came to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I said, OK, pass the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny because if they
just... That was my role in the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he came to pass the bong,
two cops walked out and took him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if passing the bong in that
day was the key or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply because it's a traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Saskatchewan, it was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He passed the joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did time in Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he did 30 days or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like, oh, what?
30 days?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 30 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, Mark was always one to push the
envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what he's ironic, too, because,
you know, just laughing like crazy.
What a stupid thing for us to be wasting
our time.
True.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he wanted to get arrested and push
the cause, but I admired him for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: even as a cop from afar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely, because even then,
there was a lot of us guys on the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not the drug warriors that you saw
from the French connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to see people try and emulate
those kind of detectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we stayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was no victim, I didn't want
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a homicide detective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wanted a victim.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I honestly, I've never met a homicide
detective that cared about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even really care about drugs,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they just want some information,
like we just need to solve this murder,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care that you had a bunch of
heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell me what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we operate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to solve a fucking homicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met many heroin addicts in some of the
homicides here, and it was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: enlightening for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not what you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's real police work.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started to get involved with it,
we looked at LEAD, and they came over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They articulated it.
[SPEAKER_05]: LEAD's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very powerful group of people to
stand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they won't appreciate me sitting
here talking about it, because I have one
[SPEAKER_01]: on my t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll put the website in the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legal operation, gentlemen,
if you are watching, and I'm a Phil
[SPEAKER_01]: Vandergraaf of LEAD, sometimes I speak for
you before you, sometimes I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say kiss my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact is, this legal operation going on
here, I've already checked Vice magazine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm MMAR, so I'm definitely happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask my hotel today,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm staying at a nice hotel in the
city.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent a fair amount of money,
and then I want to know, where can I use
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know if I walk out into the
forks and sit in the middle of the thing
[SPEAKER_05]: and pull out my mothership and a big
blowtorch, start torching my nail,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I did in my defense this morning in
front of the forks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went down to the river and I
did it there, and then I went onto the
[SPEAKER_05]: bridge and I did it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the people were just looking at
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought, I wanted to ask the hotel,
where can I medicate?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing that these hotels don't
have anywhere that they can tell their
[SPEAKER_05]: patrons, their customers, where they can
go do this safely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because they can't do that,
I can potentially invite unwanted
[SPEAKER_05]: attention into my life by being in a city
that I might not be aware of how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that the vapor lounge exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just going to continue here with
this group of great individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put all the links on how you guys can
get in touch with these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have made it back to the beautiful
hotel here, the Inn at the Forks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got the sun setting behind us
with the city of Winnipeg really kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: prominently displayed, wouldn't you say,
Al?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the Richardson building and the
old bank building.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not too many high rise buildings,
but that is definitely right behind Al's
[SPEAKER_05]: head there, the majority of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 350 million dollar giant Big
Finger from the Human Rights Museum,
[SPEAKER_05]: which you got to admit, it is a pretty
unique looking building.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, can you go up to the top?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what that top part is?
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been there yet, but I do believe
you can get a long ways up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if you get right to the top
or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the water, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know contractors that work there were
shaking their head the whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, one guy was dry walling like
five stories up on a scaffold type of
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use the mudder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dabber, which should be beside you
there, and the resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the dabber there too, inside?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've been hitting this LHO as well
as this rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosin's pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been quite nice, I would say,
wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we thought we'd finish it off with a
last session here at the Inn at the Forks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sun going down in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple of nice rips out of the mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like there's been any shortage of rips
out of the mothership, but I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: a combo rosin LHO rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicely done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use my right hand so the camera actually
shows it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we'll be required to flick the switch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a tease rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, the D-nail was at 74
degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that I've clicked the switch,
flipped the switch, she's climbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful thing about these things,
they don't take that long to heat up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The few times in my life where I've
actually done what I just did,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is put the dabber into the cold
bowl, I've managed to sort of get my head
[SPEAKER_05]: in me probably a minute later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the analog, I think, is a little
slower to warm up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see in less than a minute,
we will be ripping this bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already up to 300.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Halfway there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: 359.
[SPEAKER_05]: My D-nail set at about 680 today.
[SPEAKER_05]: On this trip, I've gone as low as 580 and
as high as 750.
[SPEAKER_05]: So quite a wide variety of rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting up to 500 here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting to feel some good heat coming
off of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be nice, a little LHO mixed in
with a rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even see their differences quite
clearly on the end of the dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm at 600 degrees and I'm going to go
for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind a low temp dab at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, eh, on the low temp, how you just
keep getting rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like one of those?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little combo rip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was a nice trip back to Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did miss a few things that I wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of wanted to take the Bubble Man's
World audience to where I smoked my first
[SPEAKER_05]: joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had plans on doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could still potentially do that
tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wake up real early and just decide that
I'm going to drive out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But tomorrow is my last day and I fly out
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the day that I'm usually kind
of scrambling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a little more anxious and I'm
traveling with family.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just want to make sure that you
have the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoyed today hanging out at the new
dispensary in town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glenn was a super cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked forward to checking out vapes off
Maine and meeting Bill Vandergraaf,
[SPEAKER_05]: ex-cop and speaker for Leap Law Officials
Against Prohibition, as well as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: activist locally here in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just thought it was nice to see him
as well and meet those guys from Vapes Off
[SPEAKER_05]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unfortunately I didn't get to meet
Eddie, the founder of Vapes On Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully we can meet him maybe as
well tomorrow morning if it works out
[SPEAKER_05]: before I fly out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise I wanted to wrap it up,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to thank Reggie Durati for taking
me around Winnipeg and showing me around
[SPEAKER_05]: today being my host.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank all the good people of Winnipeg,
Manitoba for doing the good work and
[SPEAKER_05]: continuing the activism and continuing the
important work of educating the masses as
[SPEAKER_05]: to the importance of saturating your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only for medicinal and recreational
methods, but also for preventative because
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no need to get sick if you can
take the right things to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got anything last words you want
to share, Reg?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was good for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're going to continue on puffing
some bowls and drinking this fancy water
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Inn at the Forks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you guys all for watching Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope you appreciated this Winnipeg
edition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
Bye.
