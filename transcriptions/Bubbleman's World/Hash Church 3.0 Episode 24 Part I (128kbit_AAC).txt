[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this meeting is being recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did hear that loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they got to say that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go live right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has Church 3.0 episode 24 on June 6th of
2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to quickly go in and mute
the link that's live, copy it and paste
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And paste it into the other YouTube room
so everyone can come and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Dustin Powers in the house from
Future 4200 website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk a little bit about
that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the crew is late to the party,
so it's just you and I, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice to meet you finally here on
Has Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to talking a
little bit about your website and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how you started it and how
it all kind of came to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just really much respect for what
you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seemed like a lot of the
websites, I don't want to say fell off,
[SPEAKER_02]: but kind of fell off when cannabis became
more integrated into Twitter, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook, and still they like to play and
shut down accounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really pushed through with the
chemistry and kind of brought this group
[SPEAKER_02]: of people that were still willing to stay
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't see it on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't see it on some of the other
websites that just some of the hardcore
[SPEAKER_02]: stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, the websites really crumbled
compared to what they once were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, none of them had a focus on
the cannabis processing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was, you know, those two things
between current social media platforms
[SPEAKER_05]: being a terrible repository for
information, you know, unsearchable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got all this information in the
comments that you'll never find again,
[SPEAKER_05]: which that pushed me right back into the
forum mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started, you know, investigating all
the different cannabis forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized there's a huge gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no cannabis processing forum,
you know, ICMAG, because I came up under
[SPEAKER_05]: Grey Wolf.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I knew all about ICMAG, but it's got
one subcategory for processing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no, you know, there's no
organization there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no detailed, you know,
like, like what we have on Future 4200
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just saw a giant hole and realized it
was something that we needed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's interesting that you would say
that because I remember on Overgrow back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the late 90s, early 2000s, I got on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Breeder Steve that was like,
come on to Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm in the shark tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like the shark tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the shark tank?
[SPEAKER_02]: Little did I know that's where all the
trolls hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like, got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ended up into the main, main room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't even remember what the main
room was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just talking about Overgrow right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for introducing Dustin and
bringing him onto the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Overgrow, Overgrow just had like
a photo gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where Bog and Gypsy and myself
and High Grade and some other kind of key
[SPEAKER_02]: early people were just posting these.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what we did back then was we
went and bought two and three thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar digital cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were Sony cyber shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like two point two megapixels.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like nineteen ninety nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the beginning of digital
photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the beginning of being able to
actually take a pretty decent shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny to think that two point two
megapixels was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely paid over two thousand
dollars for that camera just in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: show hash porn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how I started my company on
Overgrow and I would post all these
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures and this one forum in the in on
Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one folder that we all were posting
in was where everyone was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so eventually Shebang, who started the
website, contacted me and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, listen, I want to get you a hash
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was certainly I mean, it's just
like you were saying, like unsearchable
[SPEAKER_02]: one simple room, not really focusing on
processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But keep in mind, this was really the
beginning days to where we would get to
[SPEAKER_02]: with your website eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like it was kind of a love
hate relationship I had with it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: went from going into this one room that
had like thirty thousand people in it into
[SPEAKER_02]: a room that nobody knew existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was up to me to build up that room
and bring other hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at the same time, all that great
information, how are you going to search
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to like organize the
information and the data?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, it's very much like Hash
Church for that matter, because Hash
[SPEAKER_02]: Church is unsearchable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gems on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if ever there's people that,
you know, maybe have no lives and just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to sit around and watch ten thousand
hours of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, is there a value in picking out the
nuggets that have been said on this show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll learn a little bit about that
today from some of the things you share
[SPEAKER_02]: about, you know, future forty two hundred,
how it kind of came to be and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where it's where it's at today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to give a shout out to Dr.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing me here and thank
you for all your contributions on the
[SPEAKER_05]: forum and everything you've done for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm not on there enough because
I realized the other day as I was trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to scroll through and catch up that I'm so
behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it moves a million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, there's a lot of tongue in
cheek, you know, kind of back and forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, I think when you wade through,
there's quite a bit of useful information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, again, you fill an unmet need
that's out there, which is and I think
[SPEAKER_06]: Hash Church is different, though,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I think of Hash Church is kind
of like, again, reporting back in between
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks of future forty two hundred,
which is constantly happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's kind of like to me,
it's like forty two hundred is part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: natural continuum that there's this
dialogue and dialogue is constantly
[SPEAKER_06]: happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just like so fortunate that,
again, that I actually found a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations there because I think in my
own education, in my own self-expiration
[SPEAKER_06]: in trying to find out what are the best
methods and processes, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you ever close your mind to learning,
you're missing the ticket, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: because I have all those plaques on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean that I know everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I go there all the time and
learn new stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you think that,
oh, my God, what is this guy doing on his
[SPEAKER_06]: phone?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mostly learning, learning,
just catching up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my plaques.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my plaques.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, so there's a whole we got a
whole lot of bases to cover here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this is there's this issue with
the Internet, right, where people can act
[SPEAKER_05]: like idiots with very little repercussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I thought we had this
figured out at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a forum moderator, administrator,
it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's impossible to make everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've taken as hands off an approach as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has its pros and it has its cons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I spent a lot of time on other
technical forums, like whether it be
[SPEAKER_05]: carpentry or or working on my tractors or
in permaculture, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot more of them or a lot of them
are a lot more civil than than our forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: But our forum gets a lot more done a lot
quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it there's this give and take.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This this form of communication that we're
in right now on Hash Church definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: works well as a summary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we're looking at each other face to
face.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're much more polite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's calling each other names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody is being a troll.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's a huge important thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's all these different sides to
the Internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think you can have a platform
that does it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being able to summarize after a week of of
nonsense with little gems in there,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's that's golden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and to talk about the formation a
little bit, it came out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I wasn't able to search
Instagram and that came up because I was
[SPEAKER_05]: working a consult job and the customer
asked me a question that I didn't quite
[SPEAKER_05]: know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I knew that I had read like a week or
two previous on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, give me a sec.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can find that little gem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, 10, 15 minutes later,
I gave up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't search this at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had the thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I wish there was a cannabis
processing forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple of weeks looking, like I said,
there wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't have the technical skills to
start a forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just kind of let the idea slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, well, that would be great someday
if somebody did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: About two weeks later, I was working a
booth with Cascade Botanicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cidco Kat invited me.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's one of the original skunk farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had worked with her and J.D.
[SPEAKER_05]: and Joe Oakes at Farm Gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe actually brought me on board there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was working that booth with Cascade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Catherine was there and her son Cidco was
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the day, he said,
hey, man, you should start a forum for
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis processing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hadn't talked or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, wow, man, if that wasn't meant to
be, you know, I explained this whole story
[SPEAKER_05]: to him and I said, look, I don't have the
technical skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a bunch of ideas on how if you
do the technical side, we can get this
[SPEAKER_05]: populated immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know how you said it took you a
couple of years to get your new room
[SPEAKER_05]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leveraged the power of Instagram to
jumpstart the forum because we hit the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground running.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a couple of giveaways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the process of downloading every
single piece of scientific literature I
[SPEAKER_05]: could find on cannabis using LibGen,
SciHub.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would format the titles and
then I'd categorize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I called it the data dump.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used the data dump as incentive for
people to come to the forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put up a post.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, look, if you repost this,
if you tag a couple of your friends,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you the link to the data dump
with all of this information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just hyperlinked people over to the
forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we initially stored it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right off the bat, you know,
we had multiple thousand members just hit
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground running.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, I shared two
different large scale techniques that I
[SPEAKER_05]: had developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was bucket tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, if you got a shed and a
bunch of mid to low quality cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: can you extract the cannabinoids for cheap
and safe in your backyard and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, at scale?
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, you definitely can with ethanol
in buckets and a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we had the full write up SOP on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the same time, I had also
developed a technique for remediation of
[SPEAKER_05]: myclobutanol from distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the timing was such that
California changed its laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden, all of the distillate
had to be pesticide free.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an overnight decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you had all these companies with
millions of dollars of inventory laying
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I convinced one of them to let me come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They paid for all the testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We figured it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my deal with them was reciprocity on
the IP.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, look, you can take the IP,
do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take the IP and do whatever
we want.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't hold each other back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't tell each other what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave them like three days head start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were able to remediate all their
stuff and sell it into a market that was
[SPEAKER_05]: void of distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on my end, I wrote it all up into an
SOP.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the third, you know,
prize for coming to future 4,200 is this
[SPEAKER_05]: is where the pesticide remediation SOP
will be hosted for free forever so that we
[SPEAKER_05]: can make more clean, you know,
quality products throughout.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's kind of my underlying goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: What year was that, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to place that on the
calendar.
[SPEAKER_06]: When was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I should write these things
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But 2017, 2018, I think 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 17, 18, somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was right when that California reg
kicked in, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a hard set date in the sand
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever they change that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sure you could look that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So immediately you just had this huge
audience because there was this need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, I got to remediate my
distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I need an SOP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_06]: They go to Google.
[SPEAKER_06]: They find your thing and.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that here's a resource when I have
issues around whatever that I can kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: constantly go back to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a great story, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, Mike?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Mike, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dustin kind of mentioned, there was a
couple of states that were coming online
[SPEAKER_01]: with the requirements to test pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in many of the states were
medical, they would test for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and some analytical labs
would offer to test for the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But very little regulatory requirements
were required by medical states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a kind of unregulated
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The timing was such that some of these
labs were now getting the mass
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrometers that had the sensitivity and
the library to say, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_06]: look what's in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole bunch of crap in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we could do mass spec matches in our
library that we unequivocally know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's this compound.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's this compound.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's this compound.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was kind of like both things,
the regulation, but also the
[SPEAKER_06]: sophistication.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the analytical instrumentation in the
testing labs allowed these things to be
[SPEAKER_06]: found and quantified.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so again, going back to the usefulness
of 4200 as a form, it's like, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you need to understand about those
techniques, sensibios techniques,
[SPEAKER_06]: what kind of techniques are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you know nothing about the
field, you can do a deep dive on that form
[SPEAKER_06]: and get all kinds of information,
right, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like my people on your
professional training on the form will
[SPEAKER_05]: read through as much of that as you can
get through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have a huge jump start to if you
don't know anything to I'm going to be I
[SPEAKER_05]: got a job making hash in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great free resource for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And isn't that a funny, accurate
statement?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a job making hash next week and I
don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, why the fuck do you apply
for the job if you don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's crazy to think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you know, I didn't know how to
make pizza when I got my first pizza
[SPEAKER_05]: making job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like most a lot of people don't know what
they're doing when they get their job.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's kind of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and in a normal world, you'd be able to
go and sweep the floor for a buck an hour
[SPEAKER_05]: and learn by experience as an apprentice
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the real world, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, the industry, the industry has been
plucked clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be real.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taken away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are going to fake the fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to lie what they have to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do this in everyday jobs all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, early on, I didn't know what I
was doing and I had to figure out things.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no rule books on how to run a
dispensary or any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we just grabbed it by the
seat of the pants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, now there's rules,
as we used to, as we say before we were
[SPEAKER_04]: building a plane while flying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you've got runways, you've got
engines, you can take off, you can do all
[SPEAKER_04]: these different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So plan it before you start it and try to
do as best as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, a lot of these businesses
and jobs are new.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, getting in there and fitting
in and trying to figure it out is is a
[SPEAKER_04]: real world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Dustin's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, I got to say and shout
out to all my techs that we've trained
[SPEAKER_02]: over the last year at Embark.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys came in with very little
knowledge, most of them, and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: learned to, you know, if you teach people
the right way and the correct SOPs and the
[SPEAKER_02]: right pathways to the results that you're
looking for, it's incredible how fast
[SPEAKER_02]: people can really kind of, you know,
and I'm talking mostly solventless right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, but I'm sure it will be the same when
Mike starts training people on his side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the new hash makers that are
coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely remember the days where I
knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God I got lucky and got to stand on
the shoulders of some pretty amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: giants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people prefer people that have
little to no experience because those who
[SPEAKER_04]: have experience will want to do things
their own way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas those that have SOPs, they will
follow them to a T, which is what you need
[SPEAKER_04]: and have to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we're all about breaking the
rules, but know the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you break the rules is all I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to strike a certain balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have to be able to do
something unique and something expressive
[SPEAKER_06]: that you could put your own individual
creativity into.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're probably going to have to follow a
set of SOPs that you may not think is the
[SPEAKER_06]: best way of doing things, but regulation
and the rest of your company requires you
[SPEAKER_06]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it becomes really terrible when you
have belligerent employees that think that
[SPEAKER_06]: they know how to do it and end up either
wasting a whole bunch of product or
[SPEAKER_06]: contaminating a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have to go see.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the worst.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I want to welcome everyone else to
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Etienne Fontaine, who I just
spoke over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Johnny fucking B with the Save
the Terps hat on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy bastard that he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Mike West.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Mr. Vessel Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin Palmer's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, you came in with such a serious
face, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I looked around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I was well, I was looking at
something on my screen really intently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my that's my my mind's churning
look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see we got future 4200 Dustin.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you in the Internet fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, everyone, Johnny B, of course,
thanks for having me, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm I'm en route to California this week,
so if anyone is around, I will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So am I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: first and then San Francisco second,
so I'll be there until Friday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to San Francisco first and L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: second.
[SPEAKER_06]: When which day?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which day are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which which day are we crossing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday, we're driving down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So L.A., let me ask you guys a question,
because I've never been there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did watch the movie The Money Tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of you have ever seen
The Money Tree, but it's an incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Buddy says he's says, what's L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, oh, L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: is like a big submarine sandwich when
you're really, really hungry and you start
[SPEAKER_02]: eating it, you're just starving.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you realize there's like a big
piece of shit in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're so hungry, you just eat around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: is like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've I've lived in L.A., you know,
I've also lived in the good spots with
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd back when he was in Bel Air and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of biased in having the nice
places to stay, but I've been to there's
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of shitty places around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's it's like pockets.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like anywhere else is
surrounded by the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a megalopolis side in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more shit than sandwich for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of take it like all the
neighborhoods in New York City,
[SPEAKER_03]: like East New York, like the far reaching
corners of the Bronx, and you just put
[SPEAKER_03]: them in the middle of the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: With with with L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't cross the city without going
through those neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll never ever really change without
that changing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then like the nicer areas, the nicer
areas in which Etienne was talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's more bread there,
because if you have more bread in a shit
[SPEAKER_02]: sandwich, you eat less shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how it works?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of condiments, lots of mustard in the
Bronx.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't get me wrong there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you're talking about Universal
City, Hollywood, Beverly Hills.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about some of the most
affluent areas of the United States where
[SPEAKER_06]: they have more bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might even have a little cheese over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a little dough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bread that shit a little thin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, yeah, it's pretty much shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to avoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: San Francisco was also shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's maps that'll tell you how much
shit and where it is to avoid it,
[SPEAKER_05]: like literally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's gotten weird down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's great places to don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, it's it's it's it's a
megalopolis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got the good, the bad and the
ugly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's more bad and ugly
than there are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just going to hang out up here
in B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: for a little while longer, I guess,
and enjoy my interactions through the
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet until.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sounds like people are starting
to make trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like stuff is maybe we'll be
able to hug people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see June 21st, they said, was some date
that they're going to make some
[SPEAKER_06]: proclamation on whether or not Americans
can go back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_06]: June 21st.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anyone else heard that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like in New York, the Juneteenth,
where you get the the sun lines perfectly
[SPEAKER_03]: up with the avenue so you can get this
incredible shot all the way down our view.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll let me come back to Canada as
long as I identify as vaccinated.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way it goes, I don't think
we're doing that, are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires the two week quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's five grand in a hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that they're discussing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If both sides of the border are starting
to show herd immunity, they'll start
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at opening up the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big issue is, is obviously both
countries want to minimize the risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: variant transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only can we only quarantine in like
three hundred dollar a night hotels?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what they're saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Baller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's the 14 day minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They test you on the first day and test
you on the 10th day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe if if there's a certain
target, if 70 percent of the population
[SPEAKER_01]: has their first shot, then they're going
to probably allow vaccinated people to
[SPEAKER_01]: cross the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's you know, as with anything,
there's many, many great plagues
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout history were spread due to
travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you're traveling in a safe
and smart fashion and not traveling when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sick, you know, there's minimal
there's ways to minimize that risk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I just got to show on my little
piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although that little piece of paper looks
pretty easy to create.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just why don't you just put
that on the on the Xerox machine and put
[SPEAKER_02]: Dustin's name on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: With Marcus, man, we will never be the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just going to show up on Hash
Church one day and it'll just be me and
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus sit next to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mike, I might join you and Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I got my piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got the open up the border soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're supposed to open up
California on June 15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: But OSHA has made us aware that even
though the state is opening up,
[SPEAKER_04]: there will be no new information for
employees until July 31st.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still masks on.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the real world for for, you know,
working it and doing it, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Washington and back up this we open
back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 30th is the day they're going
to get rid of all covid restrictions on
[SPEAKER_05]: the 30th of this month, although they said
they're going to maintain the state of
[SPEAKER_05]: emergency, which gives the governor a
whole bunch of like extra constitutional
[SPEAKER_05]: powers, which is strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: But currently, they lifted the mask
mandate and there's no more restrictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, some of the denser populated like
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people are still wearing masks and
most of the businesses require masks where
[SPEAKER_05]: I live out in rural Washington on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: No mask, no restrictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Life is back to normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it ever really left normal,
but now it's actually like fully normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I really want people to do
here is hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no masks, but hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be coming on the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not doing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think I might hit this little
crazy walk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is nice little slurper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good little slurper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got my OG slurper from JP
and you can really see the length.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the length.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one really is much more like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call it there, Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: The rising film evaporator style.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's my first thought that the
path there is getting long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they based it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be where they're going with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's create a longer inner
tube, not a wider or shorter tube.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need a vacuum jacket, that little
part right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it all jacketed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you get your marbles in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three of them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hit a little six star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Johnny B's torching up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask Dustin just about some
of the controversy we hear about Delta 80.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on on that whole thread?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty big and pretty controversial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys have heard about
this topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to throw that out there for
discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew this one was coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been thinking about it a lot and
trying to follow along.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people assume that I'm
fully aware of everything that goes on in
[SPEAKER_05]: the forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: No person.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's start with why people started
making it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're going to start at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, we were running the short
path, making distillators, coming out
[SPEAKER_05]: orange, yellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of our short paths were like cheap
Chinese glass you got on Amazon because
[SPEAKER_05]: nobody was making it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just piecing together chemistry
sets.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were throwing all sorts of crazy
ideas out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them, which this is how Photon Noir
broke into the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, look, if you take
[SPEAKER_05]: an activated bleaching clay, which is just
like clay that's been acid washed or
[SPEAKER_05]: certain types of silica, like filter
sands, all of these various medias,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can throw them into the boiling flask
and the distill that comes out will be
[SPEAKER_05]: basically water clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked earlier about testing and the
ubiquity of testing and how advanced these
[SPEAKER_05]: labs were.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is way before any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is when the labs are yet testing
cannabinoid content of flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll test cannabinoid content of
your extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington is a little better than other
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: You throw these things in there,
it makes water clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing we didn't know because without
the testing and when you're just making a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of carts to send off wherever,
you're not testing every single bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was happening is you're greatly
reducing your Delta nine content and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're also greatly increasing a bunch of
other random peaks all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making a dirty mess of distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those peaks we've now realized the
eight, and this is something that's been
[SPEAKER_05]: known for a long time, but the labs just
finally caught up to what these scientists
[SPEAKER_05]: had back in the six and seventies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were making Delta eight on accident,
making really nice looking carts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moved forward quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've refined the technique through
analytics back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got really high quality DA to get that
last little Delta nine out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of really shady ways you
can make Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing it that way leaves the possibility
of having all sorts of nasties left in
[SPEAKER_05]: your distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywhere from the reagent that you used or
the catalyst that you use is something
[SPEAKER_05]: dangerous or radioactive or super toxic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have left that in there or it
could have also caused all sorts of weird
[SPEAKER_05]: side reactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We converted the Delta nine into God knows
what.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those cannabinoids that in the
literature says it killed the rats
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these weird shit that could
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't stop anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: For years, they did that and sold it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as we know, nobody died.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no chronic outbreak of everybody
died from this batch of distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that doesn't mean that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows if those people are going to get
cancer and die in 30 years or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know that about smoking vape pens
either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those might give you cancer and kill you
in 30 years too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Point is, when a member, Ion Trap,
said, everything out there has got
[SPEAKER_05]: dangerous side compounds, cyclohexanes,
all these different toxic things.
[SPEAKER_05]: My testing has showed this, this,
and this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for this one lab, I found this one
random pen that's safe and it's clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the ones I tested and yada,
yada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's like, wow, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of people jumped on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of people were like, well,
maybe that's a little weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll back a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lab that got involved with us,
KCA, they have been active on the forum
[SPEAKER_05]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're out in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been always up front about
everything they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sponsor competitions within us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: They improve their procedures based on
what we say.
[SPEAKER_05]: They hopped in and said, oh, that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to test a bunch of different
samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then at that same time, when they start,
they crowdsource this big funding or this
[SPEAKER_05]: big testing campaign and they run through
it and they get all these random samples
[SPEAKER_05]: from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes out that Ion Trap is a member of
that company or works for that company
[SPEAKER_05]: that was the one clean one.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of other people start asking
questions and it turns into this thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: long comment thread of he said,
she said, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's a scammer?
[SPEAKER_05]: KCA comes back and finds none of any of
that in multiple different, none of them
[SPEAKER_05]: had those impurities in it and they run
another round and same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turns out that people actually aren't
making super dangerous Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_05]: Delta-8, while still most of it is hot
with Delta-9 because it's a very difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: process to get that last little Delta-9
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have yet to find a random sample that
has any of these super toxic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can take a palladium conversion.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's CBN.
[SPEAKER_05]: A PTSD, a fairly toxic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you left a bunch of that in there,
it would be no bueno and be pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_05]: identify, but people are not doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeing pretty decent woot-grade
chemistry here on this Delta-8 thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unfortunate what's happening on the
regulatory side because of the implication
[SPEAKER_05]: that it could be unsafe or whatever it is
that our federal government has up its ass
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming through on D8 and not only
does that ruin the potential for D8 for
[SPEAKER_05]: its truly medicinal value, which is that
it's strongly anti-emetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost absolutely anti-emetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's super important for children that
are getting chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that people die when they're
getting chemo a lot of time is that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not able to feed themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not able to hold down nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: With Delta-8, you can completely eliminate
that problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the second problem with the
regulation that's coming about from this
[SPEAKER_05]: fear campaign basically is that it starts
to affect all the other cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_05]: have medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at now are we going to still
be able to make CBN because of the interim
[SPEAKER_05]: D8 that perhaps gets made?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are conversions going to be synthetic
chemistry of cannabis and you can't do it
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore?
[SPEAKER_05]: This D8 thing is a wild ride for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just killed a bill alone in Texas
because they added Delta-8 to the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got friends in Texas who have been
working on it and that sank that one
[SPEAKER_04]: quicker than anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the fastest torpedo.
[SPEAKER_04]: The individual cannabinoid firing and
misfiring is going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a cannabinoid
whack-a-mole situation until legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: and compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think, Dr. Skeldon?
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I don't have a problem with
the molecule itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: The molecule is cannabinoid, so it's safe,
meaning that humans can take a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to shut down your
breathing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't OD by taking Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess whether those results are real or
not, what it does call for is production
[SPEAKER_06]: under some type of regulated environment
because it's no longer an extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not extracted anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically the product of a chemical
reaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Dustin points out, depending on how you
run that chemical reaction, it could have
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of different products there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus, can you let me share my screen so
we can go through some literature I pulled
[SPEAKER_06]: up here so we can talk about this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I share my screen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I get to share a screen thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then select which on your page.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're going to do is we're going to
go back to the Michelin literature.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great, Dustin, because this is
exactly what I had as a PhD chemist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had not learned cannabinoid chemistry
academically or in my graduate work or my
[SPEAKER_06]: postdoc work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go and totally self-immersed
myself into this literature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we find a paper from Rafi.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the title of this paper is
Hashish.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a series of four of these where
just the chemistry of Hashish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, this is from 1966.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you half of our viewing audience
wasn't even born yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at what he describes here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He describes here, this is the first time
that I'm seeing this in the literature
[SPEAKER_06]: where he shows the conversion of CBD right
here over into, well, here's Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got an arrow going to Delta-8,
but he also has an arrow going to Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he recognized right away is that
you can use acid catalyzed cyclization
[SPEAKER_06]: chemistry to cyclize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's even something cooler for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look what he did after he cyclized it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He hydrogenated it and made
hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_06]: This I think is one of the first reports
of hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see it gives a mixture of both up
and down.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from 1966.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Later that year when his article published
in the Journal of the American Chemical
[SPEAKER_06]: Society, he entitled it concerning the
isomerization of Delta-1 to Delta-16.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the old nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be Delta-9 to Delta-8 these
days by our nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you see here is that yes,
he does have a procedure that uses things
[SPEAKER_06]: like sulfonic acids to basically isomerize
this, which is Delta-9 into Delta-8
[SPEAKER_06]: because Delta-8 is more thermodynamically
favored.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very interesting here because
what you also see is you can see
[SPEAKER_06]: isomerization of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, this here is CBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBC can isomerize over into this very
peculiar what's called isoTHC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where isoTHC rears its ugly head.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a paper from much later.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called the Chemical Aspects of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this paper by Hart, by Hanoush and
Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this paper, he describes what happens
when you take CBD and you treat it with
[SPEAKER_06]: acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can and mostly make Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: But under certain acidic conditions,
you can make other compounds including
[SPEAKER_06]: this isomer of THC, which is called
isoTHC.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, this group of Italians last year
published this wonderful paper on the
[SPEAKER_06]: conversion cannabidiol via acid to
catalyze intramolecular cyclization to THC
[SPEAKER_06]: isomers.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you can see here is that yes,
they talk about conversion to Delta-9 and
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-8, but they also show these two
other iso isomers, which are formed in the
[SPEAKER_06]: reaction depending on the condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on the conditions that you use,
there's two double bonds and there's two
[SPEAKER_06]: hydroxyl groups one pathway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pathway A leads to these iso products and
pathway B leads to the normal products
[SPEAKER_06]: that you find in the plant, which are the
THC configured materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Realizing that Delta-9 is first made and
then under further acidic conditions,
[SPEAKER_06]: you just see isomerization to the more
thermodynamically favored.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the plant ends and the plant
is able to do this chemistry because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: in a viral enzymatic environment where
these molecules are being made and
[SPEAKER_06]: expressed, not in a reaction flask.
[SPEAKER_06]: This gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: You start with CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think Dustin, you pointed out
because of the glut of CBD isolate on the
[SPEAKER_06]: market and the promise that this was going
to be some big opportunity, people can now
[SPEAKER_06]: take CBD and convert it into THC and put
it into products that get people really
[SPEAKER_06]: high because they have THC isomers in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you could see here if you look at
this table is that you get a plethora of
[SPEAKER_06]: different products in this reaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you take their best result here,
their best result here is right here,
[SPEAKER_06]: 93 percent Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my question is, what's the other 7
percent?
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they're quantifying the iso-THC
isomers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the iso-THC isomers in this case.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just 7 percent other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to assume that in that case,
they're actually doing some chromatography
[SPEAKER_06]: to clean it out, to turn that 93 into
something like 98 or 99 percent plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: You only have a very limited amount of
what the unknown material is at.
[SPEAKER_06]: If people can make Delta-8 a cannabinoid,
that pure using that as Marcus would say,
[SPEAKER_06]: another arrow in the quiver of being
another cannabinoid that we can make.
[SPEAKER_06]: But look at the reaction conditions here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're using a Lewis acid called TMS
triflate.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's trimethylsilyl triflate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's not only a really nasty Lewis
acid that you can't use at larger scale,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's something that's prohibitively
expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would never use this in a commercial
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would try to get away with some cheap
acid like sulfuric or some acid that you
[SPEAKER_06]: can just throw away and not have to
recover.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dichloromethane, a chlorinated solvent at
minus 10, no fucking way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could find a process by which you can
make a pure cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the wonderful thing about this for
researchers like myself, is that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: forced to publish in peer-reviewed
literature where they have to show their
[SPEAKER_06]: data.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just show you one quick thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You all know that I love NMR.
[SPEAKER_06]: NMR is nuclear magnetic resonance.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're looking at right here is the
proton spectrum for purified Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what's great about 4200 and Hash
Church and the literature is that as
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid scientists, we do have a
crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the literature and we can look
into the literature and find things like
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great for me because I can look at
my spectra and I can compare it to this
[SPEAKER_06]: like a fingerprint and see how clean
something is or how unclean something is.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I want to show you here is that this
is the proton spectrum and this peak right
[SPEAKER_06]: here, this one right here at about 6.3
corresponds to the vinylic proton that's
[SPEAKER_06]: right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you I summarize Delta-9 over into
Delta-8, that proton shifts about,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, here it is right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It shifts from 6.3, it was over here,
to about 5.4.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can use NMR as a diagnostic tool to say,
do I have Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-9, just like you can use HPLC.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's even more important is when you
look at HPLC, especially if you have the
[SPEAKER_06]: sensitivity of a mass spectrometer,
you can find all of these trace compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to just point out one more paper
from Mishulam because I love this paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this paper, what he was doing was he
was actually using a stoichiometric
[SPEAKER_06]: oxidation to make CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are interested in CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was using a dicyano-dichloroquanone,
which is a really nasty oxidant reagent,
[SPEAKER_06]: to basically convert Delta-9THC into CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love what he says about the
reaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just picture Rafi saying this
because he's such a humble guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for the quote exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: He basically says that, well, you can't
use this method because it's a really
[SPEAKER_06]: toxic method.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I wanted to point that out
is because, again, what you'll see on 4200
[SPEAKER_06]: and you'll see on other forms is that,
oh, there's a literature method to make
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: What they don't realize is that these
literature methods are not production
[SPEAKER_06]: processes to make pharmaceutical-type
compounds for human ingestion.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are to make little mounts of
milligrams of stuff to put it into testing
[SPEAKER_06]: in mice and other types of
pharmaceutical-type testing before it's
[SPEAKER_06]: actually developed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the good thing about 4200 when I
see it is that there are a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: who are chiming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell just from ion traps what he's
posting is, well, the guy is really
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been in cannabinoid science for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like having a dialogue with someone like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he have a dog in the fight?
[SPEAKER_06]: You start reading through that thread and
you're like, well, there is a clean,
[SPEAKER_06]: compliant way.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, Dustin, am I right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the title of the thread.
[SPEAKER_06]: The title of the thread is a clean,
compliant way to make Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy has a dog in the fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a dog in this fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree with him that it's bogus that
people who are flying below regulation who
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't regulated in this industry are
basically selling a chemical reaction
[SPEAKER_06]: product that's no longer a cannabinoid
extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether those things are in there or not,
Dustin, I think the discussion that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: having right now is more important to make
sure that you don't just say, okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-8 sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-8 has to be regulated like Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, now, if they knock it off,
the Controlled Dangerous Substance Act,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's one of the biggest problems with
Delta-8 is it's mentioned by name in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Controlled Dangerous Substance Act under
code 7370 as a tetrahydropenabinol.
[SPEAKER_06]: End of fucking story.
[SPEAKER_06]: That puts it outside the provisions of the
farm bill in my non-legal sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government really just put its foot in
its mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna get a drink of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_05]: On that whole deal, on one hand,
they passed off regulation of hemp over,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that set this precedent, and then
within that says, and all analogs within
[SPEAKER_05]: the hemp bill says that of CBD,
and since I can get to D8 from CBD,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why it's been allowed and spread so
wide because there is a legal discrepancy
[SPEAKER_05]: in Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up until now, that states are giving
specific exclusions to D8, but not the
[SPEAKER_05]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those states are making these decisions,
which is within the rights of a state,
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it true that people have been
extracting THC and CBD from more hempy
[SPEAKER_00]: type of products, but then they either
separate the THC or they concentrate it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that instead of being 0.3% it's more like
three or four or five or 10 or 20 and
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow legal under the Farm Act?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's illegal then.
[SPEAKER_06]: This distillate before remediated had
about 4% by weight percent THC in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it has no measurable amount of THC in
it because it's gone through a process
[SPEAKER_06]: called remediation, which is a
non-chromatography process where they use
[SPEAKER_06]: heat to basically convert the THC over to
CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: At some point, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say it's funny, but everyone
was like, oh man, CBN, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually genuine interest in CBN
because CBN does have a lot of interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone always thinks it's the sleep
cannabinoid, but I can only find,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's like one study in the literature
and it's like 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's crystalline CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of the conventional knowledge,
Sam, was that CBN was just some dark tarry
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff, but no, it's the white crystalline
solid as you know it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing, yeah, so he's
showing, so who's making that isolate
[SPEAKER_06]: right there, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make this one at future compounds,
which is our kind of compounding lab in
[SPEAKER_05]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CBN isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you held up several tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was dark colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is the CBN distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is like right after the
conversion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has not been washed yet either.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do several liquid separations
throughout the process to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: add or extract various, you know,
what's the percentage at that point of CBN
[SPEAKER_06]: purity in the distillate?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only tarred.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the white stuff is easy to say 98,
99% pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 99 plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: White and crystalline like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have CBT?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in bulk currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or CBCA?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sam, is CBC also a white solid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, if you get it, CBCA I believe
was, I don't remember with CBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there is CBC isolate out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have the genetics caught up yet?
[SPEAKER_06]: Genetics or synthesis?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you're going to get it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the cheap way is with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got a variety that produces
CBD, if you don't have a THC problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, then it just gets mass produced,
mass produced, mass produced until,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the bubble pops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I thought we were talking about this
at last hash church.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some tech that talked about
conversion of CBD to CBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark, I think it's CBG over to CBC.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a simple plant guy, but chemistry
has lead to smarter folks like you folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it's not necessarily
smarter, but you know, it's a little more
[SPEAKER_06]: detailed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the cool thing is again,
so Dustin, was this some of the literature
[SPEAKER_06]: that you kind of started with here,
the Michelin stuff, or where did you,
[SPEAKER_06]: when you started your deep dive,
where did you begin?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so first Google scholar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, if you spend any time
over there, you're going to come up with a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of Michelin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also purchased a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at a bookstore in Seattle and it is
the, it's an annals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Annals of the New York Academy of
sciences, volume 191 issue one,
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana chemistry, pharmacology,
and patterns of social use, December,
[SPEAKER_05]: 1971.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was there in, it was the last time
that they were going to meet and talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all shutting down all of their
cannabis research because the government
[SPEAKER_05]: was no longer, you know, that's when
everything changed and they weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: allowed to do research anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was like a, just a dump of
everything they had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, look, we're,
we're getting rid of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're moving on to other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's everything that we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what some of the things that I found
really interesting in there was they had,
[SPEAKER_05]: they had made every single different kind
of cannabinoid they could theoretically
[SPEAKER_05]: come up with, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're throwing random shit at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here's all these new ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had isolated it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they were taking that and feeding
it to like dogs and, uh, feeding it,
[SPEAKER_05]: injecting it, smoking them in a little
box, dogs and rats and monkeys and all
[SPEAKER_05]: sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the cannabinoids that they
listed in this book are wild and just
[SPEAKER_05]: killed, killed the animals that no
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could definitely overdose on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, and at that time we were doing
pretty large scale, like this bucket tack
[SPEAKER_05]: backyard ethanol, and then doing a crew,
you know, to crude and then distillation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just started getting photons,
you know, throw the bleach and clay into
[SPEAKER_05]: the boiling flask.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it right there when I read that,
I was like, Oh shit, what if I'm making
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's going to kill all these
dumb monkeys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh, that's not going to be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense because I mean,
again, when you treat these things with
[SPEAKER_06]: acid, I mean, THC and the Delta nine
configuration is only metastable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And converting over to Delta eight,
you know, people were always under this
[SPEAKER_06]: misconception that Delta eight is made in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not made in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biosynthetic pathway ends at Delta
nine configured cannabinoids and any
[SPEAKER_06]: conversion over to Delta eight is just
advantageous from humans fucking with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like you get to the point
where, well, okay, so what that means is
[SPEAKER_06]: over the millennia and humans using
cannabis, people have consumed Delta
[SPEAKER_06]: eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta eight is a minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of that commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a degradation component, but so are
all those hydroxylated, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids that, uh, else solely keeps
finding on his moldy weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so all those degradation, components,
are they really going to get you out?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at it, actually, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you look at those, those else solely
droxylated intermediates, they're all
[SPEAKER_06]: hydroxylated, which by the way,
is a hallmark of biological degradation,
[SPEAKER_06]: oxidation.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all hydroxylated in and around
that cyclohexane ring, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's trying to turn the thing into
bio food or whatever, but ultimately all
[SPEAKER_06]: those things are going to thermally
eliminate to give CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so like you can smoke university of
Mississippi's moldy weed with those
[SPEAKER_06]: hydroxylated things, but what you're going
to get when you inhale that is CBN because
[SPEAKER_06]: that nail temperature, those things are
all going to thermally dehydrate and make
[SPEAKER_06]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always, I always said that CBN got me
loaded, but it didn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Loaded, but not high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like Sam, when those guys were
discovering these new cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_06]: saying, Oh, look at all these.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny that those are only found on
the cannabinoids or on the cannabis that
[SPEAKER_06]: they grow down at the university of
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just changed, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that just opened up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just gave out multiple more licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Dr. Sue get one?
[SPEAKER_06]: They did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't been following that close enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it changed like a week ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the guy was on Joe, the, the founder
of maps was on Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was talking about it as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he got his license that they applied
for in like 2001.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Sue is, is one of those that is top of
the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think, um, I think it was Sue
who kind of blew the whistle on the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that a lot of that cannabis was moldy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It caused a lot of controversy because,
you know, uh, people thought, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: government weed must be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as we know, because I tested it back
in what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nine 2010.
[SPEAKER_06]: My point more, more eloquently made is
that even when the stuff goes moldy,
[SPEAKER_06]: those compounds are just fine and safe for
humans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is the guy who got the can of joints
every day or whatever was his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was patient one, but currently,
uh, there's one patient out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, there's people who smoke that
weed, like it's snow tomorrow.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and he was loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we had a whole conversation with him
and it actually made me think a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: because of course, you know, this is back
when Todd was on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all like, dude, we've got to get you
better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you need better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, listen, guys,
this weed is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just, I really quite,
I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all just like, I had a similar
discussion with Robert Randall when he was
[SPEAKER_00]: still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I said, well, you know,
if marijuana has all this great,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, benefits for glaucoma for you,
then, uh, wouldn't hashish be even better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually looked at me straight in
the face and says, has she doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: medical benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I was quite shocked and quite
surprised and didn't really want to argue
[SPEAKER_00]: with him, but, uh, yeah, that was his
personal belief.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to understand they have to sort of
be representative since they received
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't necessarily go out and,
uh, shit on it completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I mean, Robert, he's the one who
stepped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just talking in Irvin's fence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've had multiple conversations
specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking Robert, Robert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, although we, we do work with
Alice, uh, she's been assisting as
[SPEAKER_04]: veterans in all of our different filings
and, uh, keeping us up to date.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, uh, yeah, his, the 20th
anniversary of his death just,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, passed a on the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rest in peace, Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit really hit the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think eight or 10 or whatever other
compassionate, uh, programs who are
[SPEAKER_00]: available for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, from the government, but then he
showed the AIDS community how to apply and
[SPEAKER_00]: there were like 1000 applications and the
government federal government stopped the
[SPEAKER_00]: compassionate program altogether,
but it grandmothers those eight or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was into the program for life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's down to one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Mark, um, that link I just posted
into the chat is, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he starts it from THC and then he
goes from THC to CBN and then from CBN to
[SPEAKER_05]: CBC, I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: His, his, his, um, I I've read every one
of his papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to admit, um, I've read several
of his papers several times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I go back and I read them again,
just read them again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I read his paper so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could hear him speaking as he's,
as he's writing these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just the connection that we have
with the chemical literature, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I think like what I always sensed
from hash church, like in the early days
[SPEAKER_06]: when, when Horatio said, Hey, Mark,
you gotta come on because because Tony was
[SPEAKER_06]: talking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he wanted me to set Tony straight
either, you know, he's Tony's talking
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you come on to hash church and get
this guy grounded on side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I always knew that there was so
much kind of like interest and kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: hunger from the community that wanted to
know all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that machine did back in the sixties
and then Adams did back in the thirties,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just really, to me,
just fascinating because I think they knew
[SPEAKER_06]: the importance of the chemistry that they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the thing that really made Adams's
chemistry just kind of go away was,
[SPEAKER_06]: was world war two, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he published like 13 papers in
less than three years between 1939 and
[SPEAKER_06]: 1941.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the world war two happened and they
just kind of forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I think in his movie,
he talks about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: He tried to write off for NIH funding in
the early sixties to study the chemistry
[SPEAKER_06]: of the cannabis plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the NIH was like, go blow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then after he reported Delta nine
isolated, they came over and smuggled the
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 grams that he had made back,
back to Bethesda and did all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: secret government work in the NIH on it,
where they came up with actual possible
[SPEAKER_06]: rods patent, you know, on, on neuro
protection.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and, and so like, there's this whole
secret agenda that the government had on
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis while they were locking up
hippies because Richard Nixon thought that
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking weed was the end of the United
States, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it even goes back further
than that, it back to the original reefer
[SPEAKER_06]: madness bullshit, but man, where we are
today, think about where we are today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even in my lifetime, I was born in
62.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Sam's got me beat by about 10
years, but you know, we even go back just
[SPEAKER_06]: even half a century to where we are now,
to where people are doing research to
[SPEAKER_06]: where I I'm reading.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just read this paper about MDMA to treat
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, it's fucking amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we are today in the use of,
yeah, psychedelic, and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: and just a great, great place where we are
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to people like Marcus for putting
Hash Church and you for putting 4200
[SPEAKER_06]: together to educate the community because
the rising tide rises all boats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to share the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I like all the different
discussions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, for quite a while,
Dragonfly Earth Medicine was in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of going like, fuck putting chemicals
on shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, no, that's the whole plant is
better medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I totally get that perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not like, I just find it super
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this information and taking apart
the plant and learning about it and sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of expanding our knowledge on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do also see value in it, A, for the
science alone, but also for specific sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, of course, listen,
if you can get some beautiful life in the
plant.
And then, of course, you can do a lot of
research and you can do a lot of research
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's definitely living
soil, organic, you know, fed whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine or an extract through water
extraction or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the example I always use is
that the profiles change and that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to reformulate if you don't do things
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, you know, like Haley Rose,
Haley's Comet, which John could speak of
[SPEAKER_02]: as well, that sometimes that would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes it wouldn't work and it
would just change the slightest little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: in maybe the grow room variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now her medicine no longer worked and
her seizures were super or are super
[SPEAKER_02]: serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not lightweight seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are like, you know, potential life
ending critical style seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to be able to like find exactly
what works for her and then be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: just take plants apart, maybe multiple
plants, to put that profile together,
[SPEAKER_02]: make it accurate and be able to give that
to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to me, I see a value in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I get where they're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very passionate about that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope they come in later and share
with us about that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to be careful when you're
super passionate about one side that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not making a bunch of assumptions
in repelling the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Hash Church has taught me is to be
more open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I dabbing on distillate right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, I'm dabbing on six star bubble
hash and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we've got to allow the
conversation at least amongst ourselves to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to discuss these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I'll say about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I like fresh rainwater straight from
the or maybe straight from the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also like pickles and I have to take
that water, mix it with pickles,
[SPEAKER_05]: do a process to end up with those pickles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean I sometimes don't want
water and sometimes I want pickle juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had to go through the process,
this fermentation or the salting process.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is life.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what humans do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We take things and we play with it and we
change it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes we end up with things like
Delta-8 that might be beautiful medicine
[SPEAKER_05]: for a child getting chemo, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there are high use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, you're never going to get
the Delta-8 by growing the most hideous
[SPEAKER_05]: plant you ever grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a permaculturist, 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want all of my weed that I'm going to
consume to come from Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I might also take some of that and
turn a little bit into D8.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that means we can't be friends,
then so be it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't mean it's going to stop me
from doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're going to come in later.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just really busy right now.
Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the greatest of folks,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could feel his passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know also that their souls are
absolutely being crushed right now by the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 2.7% of our rainforests in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our elder forests are getting cut down
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping they're going to come in as
well and give an update on that because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a pretty fucked up situation that's
going on here in BC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's circle back on the trees too because
we have the same thing happening down here
[SPEAKER_05]: in Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let me move.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking off, Colin?
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got to get going, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, it was really nice to see you
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll catch you guys on the next show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get it ready to fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Colin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a beautiful Sunday, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You too, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: You too, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we got right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says CBG, Cannabagero, and they label
it as VII.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dehydrogenated with chloranyl and
benzene, which like you were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about, yuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: They explain how and why it ends up
converting itself to cannabichromine,
[SPEAKER_05]: which they've labeled as VIIII,
and a pretty decent U, especially since we
[SPEAKER_05]: can now bulk grow CBG in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the ... You can just see the move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's VII, so CBG goes with chloranyl in
that benzene soup to VII.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so let's just talk about chloranyl
for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a chlorinated aromatic that
basically makes dioxin-type compounds when
[SPEAKER_06]: it's consumed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you're going to make this in a
laboratory, it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to make this for human
ingestion, got to be something just
[SPEAKER_06]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I would worry about
with this kind of thing is that ... The
[SPEAKER_06]: reason why I pointed this out,
Dustin, is just as an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's literature where you could say,
okay, there's a method out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I need to know, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: A guy in a warehouse or in a garage would
say, well, here's a method.
[SPEAKER_06]: What equipment do I need?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's piece it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's figure this shit out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did it so we can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the other important thing,
and again, I know Colin would agree with
[SPEAKER_06]: me that one of the big issues,
I think, is not just necessarily the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're making this, but being able to
have the intellectual capacity to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that you need to develop a
process for commercialization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Run it several times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you run a commercial process,
I think Marcus, she'd probably agree with
[SPEAKER_06]: me, especially when it comes to stuff
that's related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's variables that sometimes subtly
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't tell with our naked eye,
or it takes very sophisticated looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: many, many different properties to be able
to reproduce a process time and time again
[SPEAKER_06]: to make the ... for something that's going
to go into people, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only do you need the analytical
controls, but you need to be able to run
[SPEAKER_06]: that process four and five times,
look at the data and see what kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: spread you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a process like this where it says,
I don't know, 95% yield, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: what if you run it again and next time
it's 98, or what if you run it next time
[SPEAKER_06]: it's 88?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have this constantly
moving thing that you need to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: standardize.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that I really don't like about
using a stoichiometric oxidant like this
[SPEAKER_06]: is it makes stoichiometric waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, it's chlorinated halogenated
chlorinated waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chlorinated phenols are the synthetic
precursors to dioxins.
[SPEAKER_06]: These things, if they haven't made
dioxins, will go to a landfill and make
[SPEAKER_06]: dioxins in a landfill.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just not good, not practical,
would never be scaled up commercially
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I got to echo things.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how we got to Delta-8,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, we got to Delta-8 on accident,
but once we realized what we were doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is how we progressed Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went into the literature, saw that they
were doing crazy things with crazy
[SPEAKER_05]: solvents and acids that most of us can't
even get our hands on.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's step one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of these ... and that's changing as
our future compounds lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now have access to quite a bit of
stuff, but we never sold any of our
[SPEAKER_05]: intermediates and never would because it's
not safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs a lot of cleanup.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we obviously want to use the
cheapest, safest solvents and acids
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always where we start and work in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Dustin, look what he says right here
on this paragraph to the right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Work done by our group and others has
shown that one, which is Delta-9,
[SPEAKER_06]: can be readily isomerized to Delta-2 in
the presence of peritoneal and sulfonic
[SPEAKER_06]: acid and nearly quantitative ... That's
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're off to the races.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a chemist now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We just made a chemist out of a bunch of
people by listening to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the big, giant secret right there
that's made a lot of people a lot of money
[SPEAKER_05]: in the last couple of years.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry that I keep hijacking the
conversation market.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chatting in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you're right about the waste
products because you can get all of this
[SPEAKER_05]: to a safe spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, could you do that cost effectively?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but you can wash,
scrub, pass through chroma, get it to an
[SPEAKER_05]: isolated compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: We take this isolate that's at 99.8% or
99.9% in CBN isolate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There could have been lots of nasty shit
happening before that that now is not
[SPEAKER_05]: present in this, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not radioactive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides that, at this purity, disregarding
the idea that we're throwing away a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of nasty shit, or in theory, we're
throwing a bunch of nasty shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to have a pretty clean process for
this CDN, but right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these, and they go through a lot
of this, they get to an isolate point and
[SPEAKER_05]: then are checking it on NMR.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say that at the beginning of this
paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they've confirmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're getting this stuff to some
ultra purity, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That CBC that they made with this nasty
process that they got to purity would,
[SPEAKER_05]: in theory, be safe to consume,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but again, to use chromatography on
the laboratory scale where you're just
[SPEAKER_06]: putting a column together with 60 grams of
silica.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had to do that and make several
hundred kilos of material, it would be not
[SPEAKER_06]: only cost prohibitive, but I mean,
the process chemistry and the equipment
[SPEAKER_06]: that you would need takes a substantial
investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, let's just compare it to
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are certain drugs that are insanely
expensive because the only way that they
[SPEAKER_05]: can get there, well, politics aside,
the only way they can get there is through
[SPEAKER_05]: that investment that you said it took so
much money to scale up this entire thing
[SPEAKER_05]: that when we get this 1% of 1% yield,
that's the magical medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that may have gone through a nasty
process to get there, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you're discovering a
medicine, there's usually two phases.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a discovery.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do a lot of discovery and you try to
find new structures and you make a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: different compounds, basically assembling
Legos in different ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when you find your set of Legos,
there's a development.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you find out that that not only has the
biological activity you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_06]: but hopefully some sort of safety
assessment or safety assessment on the
[SPEAKER_06]: metabolite.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a pill.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen inside the body?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you look at a lot of different things
when it comes to safety assessment,
[SPEAKER_06]: because again, a drug is not a food
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, the pharmaceutical mantra is to
certainly hook you for life and to make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that you have to take this medicine
for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume that again, the discovery
phase can use all kinds of chemistry to
[SPEAKER_06]: get there to discover the molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the most important phase is the
development phase, which is where you take
[SPEAKER_06]: that initial molecule or compound that's
been discovered and now think about how do
[SPEAKER_06]: we actually make a manufacturing process
to make this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not going to necessarily use the
laboratory synthesis to make it because
[SPEAKER_06]: the laboratory synthesis uses all this
toxic, expensive crap that we can't use on
[SPEAKER_06]: the shit ton scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to make this drug, we need to make it
on a shit ton scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't just create a bunch of,
you know, for every one pound of product,
[SPEAKER_06]: you create 20 pounds of waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mark, when they're doing that process,
before they go to the manufacturing scale,
[SPEAKER_05]: they've done their safety testing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, typically you do initial research.
