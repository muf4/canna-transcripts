[SPEAKER_02]: Alright!
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man and Chester!
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in Amsterdam!
[SPEAKER_02]: We're back in Amsterdam, here again at the
Dam Square.
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost got killed by that tram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a tram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, you do not want to mess around
with these trams.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will hit you!
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's the last day of the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: 26th Annual Cannabis Cup Live Times here
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on our way to the Milk Veg,
the Milky Way and the Leidseplein and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to see the awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping we're not going to be too
late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't put too much stock myself into
these awards, but I've got friends that
[SPEAKER_02]: have entered and I love to congratulate
them when they win.
[SPEAKER_02]: And support them, you know, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And support them, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go get some video at the
Milk Veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll show you some of the winners and
we'll probably go pop some bowls with some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the people who placed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably so, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned!
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we hit the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, Chester.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys soon.
Alright!
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey pal, have you ever driven a bike
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus!
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost got killed by the fucking tram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's getting mad at you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's John B.
[SPEAKER_02]: John B is just in front of us in the tram
and the tuk tuk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I don't fall out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a pretty big tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everybody okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all gravy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head down to the Milky Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the last people on the last day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to go to the awards show
and see the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see who won for best hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go out on a limb and say it
was water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for parking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of a delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost won the last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice try there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought he was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was betting on it, but not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just needed to get that wheel over that
curb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can take a ride with the girl on
the scooter.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Fabiola.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Fabiola?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabiola's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, catch that guy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got you got more days here
though, right?
Another fine day.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
I know.
It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who I am, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wasn't up to it, I wouldn't have come
so out of bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be happy to us if we don't
see you guys one day.
