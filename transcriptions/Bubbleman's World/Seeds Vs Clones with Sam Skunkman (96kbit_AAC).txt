[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your email said, and I thought
it was a really great context,
[SPEAKER_03]: a good place to kind of jump off the
conversation, which is why I mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark and Kevin, was seeds versus clones,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how those two different types of
propagules influence cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a lot of history in
that conversation because we've ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: using clones because of the way cannabis
has been over hybridized for years and
[SPEAKER_03]: years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, up until recently,
the only way to get to crop uniformity was
[SPEAKER_03]: to use clones, right, to get chemical,
chemical stability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the work that I did with Mark
Lewis down in California was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably some of the earliest work on
towards getting towards chemical stability
[SPEAKER_03]: in a seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the last few years, you know,
phylose and relentless genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, refined genetics, these guys have
come along.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've come a long way in creating
actually stable seed lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so- Well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: You say refined genetics is stable,
but they don't use true homogenous parents
[SPEAKER_04]: to create their F1 hybrid so-called stable
varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say stable, I mean uniform is
really what I meant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're using inbreeding to create almost
homogenous varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and that's the way that it's been
typically done in corn is through
[SPEAKER_03]: inbreeding to create, you know,
either inbreds or recombinant inbreds that
[SPEAKER_03]: we then use to create F1 hybrids,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So an F1 hybrid, an F1 hybrid,
my definition is not stable, but it's- Dr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boksha always told me, don't use the
inbreds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time you inbreed, you take away
bigger and bigger, you know, so I'm a
[SPEAKER_04]: believer in what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at- You did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you did do that in the creation of
the propo lines, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you created those swarming lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we also did was we restored all
the vigor, which is what they hope that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're also doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not starting with homogenous
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't start with absolutely homogenous
homozygote lines either, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we only sell them three or four
generations and that's not enough to do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to have a true homozygote,
you need to double a haploid or do some
[SPEAKER_04]: other trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean- I'm never seen an IBL actually
from like 50,000 seed population.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to throw this out there for
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is ever resembled anything true to
form on the parent stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen- IBL is a silly term.
[SPEAKER_02]: More chasing of dreams than I've ever seen
in my entire career.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I have described it was,
okay, so you take an IBL that's a cross
[SPEAKER_04]: between a white plant and a black plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither one of those really exist,
but regardless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you backcross it to either the
white one or the black one for three,
[SPEAKER_04]: four more generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're never going to get a black
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're never going to get a white plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to end up with- you
understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, we use the term IBL in the
cannabis world in a really silly way.
[SPEAKER_03]: IBL means inbred line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be inbred one generation or it
could be inbred 10 generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you end up with different things along
the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we say homozygous, we really mean at
multiple traits in the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're starting to fix traits along
the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the farther down we go the line,
the more homozygous it becomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you self a plant, every generation
you get 50% more homozygosity through the
[SPEAKER_03]: process of selfing subsequent generations.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And one good example of this is when Sam
sent the skunk over to the University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Mississippi, they inbred it for a whole
bunch of more generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: One to one, one to one, one to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually they got to a state that
they called isozygous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isozygous just means the same on both
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's approaching what you'd get from
like a double tap.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did it on a family line level in
California for 10 years before I brought
[SPEAKER_04]: it to Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I used clones to reproduce the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people, like when I sent those to Dr.
Voksha, he also told me that they were,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, no, it was a cytology lab we did,
that they were more homozygous than any of
[SPEAKER_04]: the registered hemp varieties that exist
in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's step number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those things have been also bred
on a population level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes back to this inbreeding
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you inbreed cannabis, cannabis is an
obligate out-crosser like humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you breed two plants together,
they each have their own variation in the
[SPEAKER_03]: family heritage that is essentially
replicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very unnatural process to breed
brother to sister, brother to sister,
[SPEAKER_03]: brother to sister over a series of
generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in humans, you just can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You end up getting all these weird deep,
deep defects in the children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because there's this really
high genetic load of defective alleles,
[SPEAKER_03]: or what we call lethal alleles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so essentially, we have these built-in
genetic mistakes in all of our genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is no different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you start putting them into this
inbreeding process that's quite unnatural
[SPEAKER_03]: to cannabis, you start uncovering all
these traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they start pairing up in a homozygous
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you end up with really bad-performing
plants, or plants that just start getting
[SPEAKER_03]: weak, which is why Bokska would say,
don't inbreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, it's a means to an end.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're inbreeding with the intention to
out-cross at the end, that's how you can
[SPEAKER_03]: restore vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as long as at the end, you combine to
restore the vigor, have different
[SPEAKER_04]: backgrounds, that really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did DJ Short do in all of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't he inbreeding and finding mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain a little bit about how he
went about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he had always seemed to work out
in his favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anybody that's grown blueberry
would really say that it's not a very
[SPEAKER_03]: high-performing plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got all these weird crinkle-leaf
mutations in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a slow-growing plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't yield very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you out-cross it to a bunch of
different lines, like we did in our hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: or joint projects, the out-cross is
actually way out-performing the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually a really good example of
what we call inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's genetic weakness that gets built into
these lines as you go throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: inbreeding process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mark, you've done a lot of work on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've seen it to some degree in
your work as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know, but we've been
focusing really hardcore on type 3s for
[SPEAKER_01]: the past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of action on the type 1 side for
genetics these days, because everybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: a tendency not to respect contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the type 3 side, we took the
propyl, 3Vs, and we inbred them by terp
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have about 12 inbred lines that are
S3 or deeper now and same on the pental
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you pair those terp cassettes up,
you get your hybrid vigor back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get twice the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll watch the oil start
depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that first introgression step,
you'll have like 3%, 4% oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you inbreed, the total oil
just keeps going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you lock in the terp cassette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you bring it back to the
pental, you get that hybrid vigor back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's exactly what we did for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a place in Europe called the
Crag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do a lot of genetic work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were saying that it only takes
three inbred steps in different directions
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to create a hybrid with hybrid
vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So S3 one way and S3 the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can bring them back together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it to three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we made a few that were five
self-generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after three or four, most of them were
functionally sterile.
