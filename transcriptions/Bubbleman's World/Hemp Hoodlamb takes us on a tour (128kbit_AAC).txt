[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Bubble Man here with Doug from
Hemp Hoodlum in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you want to give us a tour of your
office, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, come see our new office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come right in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This photo was taken in Ibiza.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like snow, but it's actually a
salt mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that worked for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually done in Amsterdam
when the canals froze over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you take a canal boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on this situation, you're able to
walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen every winter anymore,
does it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it happens about every eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, five to eight years or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we have the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, we have Santa's little helpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's cutting hemp insulation for our
entry into the Canada's country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a drop TH seeds, not bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we were just to drop seeds instead
of bombs, the world would be a better
[SPEAKER_00]: place, especially if they're MK Ultra
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one bean in each package?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a feminized MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to get some good ganja
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our hemp art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is George in jail because if he was
alive today, he would be for the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp he grew, he would be behind bars for
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be next to Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would be horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here is your... Our new drop
seeds, not bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually came up with that in I think
it was 95 the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logo was different, but that was our
slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember playing with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95 was my first cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, ahead of Booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the upper office where we do
internet sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's our other slogan, of course,
which is May Camp Not War.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we entered last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around, this is our winter jackets,
our winter collection, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the hoodlum stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, you have... It's kind of a
mess now because of the ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our summer range for 2014,
next summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got an electric scooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For making deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing we like to do is to
support Sea Shepherd against killing the
[SPEAKER_00]: whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a percentage of everything that is made
and sold goes towards Sea Shepherd to help
[SPEAKER_00]: stop the whaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the signature from
Captain Paul Watson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from Captain Alex,
who was captain of three different boats
[SPEAKER_00]: for Sea Shepherd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just here last week, and we sent
off for the next campaign, which is called
[SPEAKER_00]: No Resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should know the name of it, but it's
going to be another successful campaign to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop the whaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here, we have the guys more
messy side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where we keep the... These are our
leftover hemp rolls, which we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: decoration and for sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And upstairs is where we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoodlum crew holding it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beginning of the cannabis
camp, all starting tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for having us out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
