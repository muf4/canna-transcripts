[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world
just a short little clip here today on a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful afternoon I wanted to show you
just a few of my plants my mom's as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as some mixed in they're going to go into
the next bloom potentially with the lush
[SPEAKER_00]: XL dominator light that I have on the way
shout out to Kingston herb and the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: people at lush for setting that up we're
going to be doing a side-by-side
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison and I'm hoping some of these
babies right here will end up in that
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison what we're going to do is have
the lush on one side and HPS on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side or potentially two separate tents
we'll see what happens anyway wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you guys what we got going here today
so we've got many haze this is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little guy a little bit bigger of an astro
boy another many haze from mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Burfella and what else we got we got
Hoss the haze cross with the OG crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the skunk man I'm looking forward to
checking out the Hoss she's real nice next
[SPEAKER_00]: to that we've got the East Coast sour
diesel stretching out like nothing I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen very very crazy long stretches
with nothing from the stock where I cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up six plus inches before
there's growth sites keep cutting her down
[SPEAKER_00]: next up we have another many haze so I've
got three many hazes that are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: going into bloom should be interesting to
see what she produces right next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: many haze you see this bush which I've yet
to really trim down and that is a sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk this one I did manage to spin down
trim down this is the Barbara bud and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: really trimmed her down nicely and that is
the original Barbara bud that Matt the
[SPEAKER_00]: great gardener gave me on the video there
right next to that is his Afghani nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little Afghani a little side branch coming
off there nice fat stock on that Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: Congolese nice bush on the Congo looking
really forward to flowering some Congos
[SPEAKER_00]: out and then up here we have house of the
great gardener Afghani another sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that I've posted on my Facebook
account the last couple of times just
[SPEAKER_00]: really loving the petite-ness of this
plant how it's almost bonsai getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go big Barbara bud so this will be the
first of the Barbara buds look at the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaf on a tiny plant like that you
know give you an idea the size of that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and finally last but certainly not
least we have the 20 year old Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: triploid so as you can see on this
Jamaican we have a triploid right here we
[SPEAKER_00]: have this leaf we have this leaf and we
have this leaf all coming off the base
[SPEAKER_00]: stem instead of a two leaf we're rocking a
triploid so that's always very exciting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that one two three I'm sure you guys
can all see it and that is the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: lambs red cross from 1995 you can see
another mutation in this leaf here as we
[SPEAKER_00]: lift the leaf you can see more leaf
underneath it a bit of a strange mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah so back over the babies
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different leaf structures what can
I say I'm super excited to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants all mothered out for future clones
and the ones that are going into the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm super excited to check out the
possibilities between the LED the HPS the
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halides and everything in between
I'm looking forward to growing resin for
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin production I want to show you
guys the profiles I want to show you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: the melt factors and just learn a bunch of
new things as we're doing it so stay tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: keep watching bubble man's world and we'll
talk to you next time Peace!
