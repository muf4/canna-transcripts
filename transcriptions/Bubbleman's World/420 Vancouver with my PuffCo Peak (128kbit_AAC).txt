high But we're still capable of doing

getting hurt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is how we do it every year Okay
Everybody the ground has been dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only been a little bit of drizzle
All day, so the ground is dry We need a
[SPEAKER_07]: pathway that goes right from the middle
all the way to the first tip there and
[SPEAKER_07]: then we need to pass So before the girls
with the joints even come walking out the
[SPEAKER_07]: first thing you're gonna do is make a path
So I need some pothead to organize Take
[SPEAKER_07]: two steps back that way take everybody
take two steps back that way We need a
[SPEAKER_07]: path that goes all the way to the end all
the way to the end

need marijuana in the world so we can
