[SPEAKER_01]: So I was gonna maybe start with Mike a
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got something you want to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just gonna say there's skunk
man's here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to hear a quick intro
from him I know a lot of people know a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: about him, but it might be a neat thing to
hear a couple of words from from the man
[SPEAKER_01]: himself Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot No problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he is now howdy howdy howdy everybody
in Hatch Church Yeah, I my experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse was I built my own greenhouse
about 40 years ago and then I moved to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands where I ran many many many
professional greenhouses with computerized
[SPEAKER_02]: darkening computerized watering and and My
favorite way to grow is greenhouses
[SPEAKER_02]: although there's But I I've been there
I've seen most of the changes we were one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the very first in the world to use
darkening for a few mature cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers in the when we were in the
northern environment in the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody has any questions, I'm I'll be
happy to step up to the box But except for
[SPEAKER_02]: that I am what I am and I think pretty
much everybody knows me Thanks for sharing
[SPEAKER_06]: we bring out Sam I don't know you I would
be interested to hear about your
[SPEAKER_06]: progression Of you know greenhouse growing
and and some of your maybe your life
[SPEAKER_06]: deprivation experiences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is it on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, howdy howdy I've been growing in
greenhouses ever since the first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew cannabis in Santa Cruz that was in
maybe 70 72 or something around like that
[SPEAKER_02]: and That was just a homemade primitive
greenhouse once and friends of mine were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing Darkening for sexing not for
flowering but for sexing and that was in
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern, California But one of the
problems with the sexing was at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't really understand what they
were doing So they would darken it for two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks until the plant showed sex Whereas
what the research that I found when we
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing the research in Holland was
that most indica varieties you can darken
[SPEAKER_02]: for one day and then two weeks later they
will show sex they and they were not
[SPEAKER_02]: staying on and with with veg with Excuse
me with sativa varieties sometimes they
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be darkened two or three days at
the very most But then two weeks later
[SPEAKER_02]: they show the sex just and so it's I mean
I had a friend who produced thousands and
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of seedlings and then darkened
them off just for sexing to sell early
[SPEAKER_02]: known female plants to people and A few
times he because he darkened them for two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would not come back So the customers
were rather irate that they had these
[SPEAKER_02]: little plants that were you know Two feet
tall and flowered off and they would not
[SPEAKER_02]: return veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you also tell the story of how you
discovered?
[SPEAKER_02]: like greenhouse light depth in greenhouse
light depth What happened was I went into
[SPEAKER_02]: a curtsanthum greenhouse I because I was
interested in building my own greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: or or or buying one or renting one or
whatever and so I saw the cursanthums were
[SPEAKER_02]: being darkened to induce flowering and I A
light went on in my head, and I went Jesus
[SPEAKER_02]: Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I had seen people darken plants
with a tarp in the late 70s and early 80s,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I wasn't interested because I wanted a
greenhouse that was multiple acres and You
[SPEAKER_02]: can't hand darken multiple acres well
actually you can if you have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor, but it's so once I saw what
darkening could do I instantly understood
[SPEAKER_02]: what this was for cannabis and So that was
I don't know maybe 86 or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that and but what once I saw that yeah,
I never stopped that back for for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands you need darkening because you
can you can grow multiple crops a year or
[SPEAKER_02]: you can grow one big good heavy crop and
Darken it and get it out before the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes and your heating bills are ten
thousand dollars a day a week And can you
[SPEAKER_03]: also comment Sam on earlier?
[SPEAKER_03]: Micah was talking Micah was talking and he
mentioned how he kind of Likes to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: them a little bit smaller which might be
perfect for what he's doing and producing
[SPEAKER_03]: super high-quality flowers But you came in
as a sort of like oh, I'd like to have
[SPEAKER_03]: really big greenhouses and maybe just talk
to wire that is Well the main reason is is
[SPEAKER_02]: I like big plants a lot of the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing is not commercial production
It's breeding work and for breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start seeds thousands and thousands of
seeds and then what I do is I Want to pick
[SPEAKER_02]: the best plants and to pick the best plant
from seed It's very difficult to do with a
[SPEAKER_02]: little one or two foot plant you grow at
12 feet tall You get a really good idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: its positive and negative qualities and
for for a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's really required so I That's why
I had a very high ceiling my ceiling was
[SPEAKER_02]: well Maybe 20 feet or so and I could grow
15 foot tall plants if I want get three
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five kilos of dried material Let
me ask you Sam about the sexing one more
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know for people that are you
know, maybe Don't have a lot of power
[SPEAKER_01]: still in Humboldt or you know these craft
farmers if they were to sex their plants
[SPEAKER_01]: like you were saying how long if it was
it's depending on strain you would say but
[SPEAKER_01]: if somebody was to do it would you say to
darken it for a day or two instead of the
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks like you're Because I
experienced the same thing I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that Didn't come back out of the
veg and it was a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you talk a little bit more about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is my mic on you're okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing is that Cannabis will take
two weeks to express its sex But one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two days of darkening is enough to trip
the expression two weeks later That's the
[SPEAKER_02]: main thing you have to understand with
earlier varieties only one day if it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: very late late Equatorial variety,
maybe it takes two or three days at the
[SPEAKER_02]: very most and then when you put them back
on a long cycle two weeks later They sex
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't stay flowering face Are
totally veg and you grow them really
[SPEAKER_02]: really big and then flower them off and
you know what sex they are That's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: like at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should also say you're welcome because
that was a gem right there
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely a game-changer thank you for
dropping that knowledge You know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean like couldn't we can't we quantify
things with lab tests sometimes because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that I've talked to a few lab
companies that have said over the course
[SPEAKER_01]: of time some of the greenhouse material
they've been testing has has tested higher
[SPEAKER_01]: in the THC CBD and even the terpene
percentages and I know that the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: companies bubble man, maybe you Might know
something about that with greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: material and the terpene production that
you might have heard about or known Let me
[SPEAKER_03]: see am I unmuted yeah, okay, yeah from you
know right from Tony's mouth almost always
[SPEAKER_03]: the lights at the greenhouse is gonna
produce like a way higher level of terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: production, you know, not just a smaller
amount but like a substantially larger
[SPEAKER_03]: amount and not to change the subject
completely but while I have the mic one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the things Sam was mentioning about
greenhouse triggering flowering as well
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly in I guess it was in like
Close to the equator countries where they
[SPEAKER_03]: have 12 hours and 12 hours of light and
darkness And often people are trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow with added lights additional light
They'll maybe put it on for another five
[SPEAKER_03]: or six hours Sam had an interesting bit of
information to share on tropical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growing but basically what we found is
that We're even in the Netherlands when I
[SPEAKER_02]: would grow big giant plants at 10 12 feet
tall over the winter I could give as
[SPEAKER_02]: little as I was using these little 60 watt
blue incandescent Agricultural balls from
[SPEAKER_02]: Phillips and So they were geared towards
but but they were only 60 watts and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would use one of those for every 10 square
meters, so that's a hundred square feet
[SPEAKER_02]: and It absolutely prevented flowering not
not only that but you could use as little
[SPEAKER_02]: as just in the instead of giving them six
or eight hours of light to keep them veg
[SPEAKER_02]: What you could do is just in the middle of
the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them two hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they needed all you do Yeah,
I've been doing this for 30 years That's a
[SPEAKER_03]: big one for people that have been
especially in countries where you know He
[SPEAKER_03]: was mentioning like only having one
generator only being able to turn on
[SPEAKER_03]: enough light in one section of the
greenhouse You could do a quarter here a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter there a quarter there and instead
of leaving it on I'll tell you how severe
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was storing plants under
refrigeration at about plus three four
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees so they're in a refrigerator with
lights and All's I gave them was 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes of light four times a day so every
five hours I'd give them or five or six
[SPEAKER_02]: hours I give them 15 minutes of light
totally preventive flower and they stayed
[SPEAKER_02]: veg They also weren't growing because it
was so cold All's I was trying to do is
[SPEAKER_05]: keep the plants alive as a library Did you
see that there was any reduction in actual
[SPEAKER_05]: growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh growth practically I mean under under
three degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's practically zero growth Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't trying to grow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to maintain them Yeah,
yeah, but Mike I guess my question is is
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I think some people would argue
will they keep all these lights on because
[SPEAKER_05]: not only do they want to Keep the photo
period going, but they're also trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: have the plant grow at the same time So
I'm just curious if you saw any difference
[SPEAKER_05]: at any point in your in your experiences
where there you could see like a
[SPEAKER_05]: difference in growth growth rates the more
Lumens and the more hours, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna get more growth, of course
But that wasn't my goal my goal was to I
[SPEAKER_02]: had big plants in the ground which I
conserved in my greenhouse I had a small
[SPEAKER_02]: collection on on ebb and flow tables under
under halides and Just as a library and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had a third collection in I had specially
made like a refrigerator with lights built
[SPEAKER_02]: into it which and in those I I gave them
as little as an hour a day it broken up in
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 minutes so that They never received
really long periods of dark at any one
[SPEAKER_02]: time Awesome information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing Yeah, I just met a guy
in Humboldt a lot of my research comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from old old school growers in Humboldt
County and they said the same thing Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: was saying as far as the keeping the
plants in veg The guy came here recently
[SPEAKER_01]: and did a greenhouse tour and he goes no I
only have my light on in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night for one hour in The winter time to
keep him in veg and I thought one hour and
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah To save on generator and power and
all these things that people deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't use all this electricity or
access to it Maybe in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night, you know So when he told me that in
the veg period he that he only uses the
[SPEAKER_01]: light for one hour in the middle of the
night I was just like holy crap and now
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to hear little bits and
pieces of it and then of course now Sam is
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of confirming that whole thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I'm gonna try it, you know,
like I think it's pretty cool I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try the sexing stuff and play around with
all those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like doing experiments and and Thing to
remind yourself is is lots of lumens less
[SPEAKER_03]: time like an hour, but less lumens maybe
two hours To prevent flowering right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind as your sort of
recipe as you get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, cuz I'm sorry, so that I'm
just I just want to make sure I'm hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: you right So the thought process is don't
don't give them a long period of no light
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying just break it up and you're
turning the light on for 15 minutes Every
[SPEAKER_01]: hour I've heard that and I know Sam was
saying that for his library and part of
[SPEAKER_01]: his experimentation was to keep these
plants from Growing but to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: library and so he said he dosed him in a
couple times 15 minutes at a time if I
[SPEAKER_01]: heard you right Sam and Then a two hours
and what he were just confirming was the
[SPEAKER_01]: two hours for a low lumen light Right
exactly if you had higher lumens you could
[SPEAKER_03]: use maybe less time thing you wanted to
share about talking about lumens But
[SPEAKER_02]: basically what we found is that absolutely
need lots of lumens to Produce biomass and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetation is flowered halfway or more and
pretty much also it's going to do then is
[SPEAKER_02]: fill out the flowers and Maybe add a lot
of weight from resin and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found lower light levels I'm talking
about from the Sun or from artificial
[SPEAKER_02]: lights actually produce superior product
also what I found is that the high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures associated with flowering
really high temperatures It's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: positive because it has a tendency to
vaporize terpenes right on the plant So
[SPEAKER_02]: lower temperatures a little bit lower
lumens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found produce superior product Here when
we were on mute that would you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: mention it Sam?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to mention that when I grew
the identical clone big small even In
[SPEAKER_02]: vitro so that the flowered off plant was
only Maybe an inch or two tall when it was
[SPEAKER_02]: completely flowered in agar agar in vitro
in a test tube The resin is much smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: the resin individual resin heads on that
plant when you grow it two three feet tall
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're talking about for sea green or
something the the resin is is Quite a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit bigger, but when I grew my same
clone, and it was 12 feet tall the resin
[SPEAKER_04]: was again a little bit That's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We we missed that last that last little
part, but Well the the last little part
[SPEAKER_02]: was that if your plant is 12 feet tall and
you flowered off, and then you collect the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin from that it's again a little bit
bigger than the Three foot plant the each
[SPEAKER_02]: individual resin head is a little bit
bigger and for hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important you
