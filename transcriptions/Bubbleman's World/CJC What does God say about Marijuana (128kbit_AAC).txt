cannabis journal club with dr david allen
[SPEAKER_00]: and bc bubble man uh the cannabis journal
club is where we review and interpret
[SPEAKER_00]: united states cannabis patents and
scientific journals with concise overviews
[SPEAKER_00]: of complex scientific literature in an
understandable and easy to consume manner
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain the knowledge hidden within the
scientific literature we do not claim any
[SPEAKER_00]: medical utility but we do advise you to
obtain your own copies of these public
[SPEAKER_00]: documents and share them with your doctors
and your family so without further ado i
[SPEAKER_01]: will introduce dr allen welcome thank you
hi i'm dr david allen and this is cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: journal club and we're going to throw you
a little bit of a curve today normally we
[SPEAKER_01]: just talk about cannabis science but today
we're going to talk about god so what does
[SPEAKER_01]: god say about marijuana so on the first
page of the bible genesis 129 it says and
[SPEAKER_01]: god said behold i have given you every
green herb which is upon the face of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth and every tree bearing seed and
for you it shall be for meat so god wants
[SPEAKER_01]: us to eat herbs now romans 14 2 says some
may eat all things others who are weak eat
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs and romans 14 3 says let those that
eat herbs not despise those that don't and
[SPEAKER_01]: let those that don't eat herbs not judge
those that do so in the king james bible
[SPEAKER_01]: it says it's wrong for man to judge people
using herbs and uh in exodus 30 23 you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find the recipe for god's holy anointing
oil and you will be surprised that that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was part of god's holy anointing
oil in the king james version it says
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet calamus but the hebrews call it
cannabis and so that's cannabis and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: god's holy anointing oil you should check
it out and show other people so we hope
[SPEAKER_01]: god is happy with with making us and we
hope god helps us spread this information
