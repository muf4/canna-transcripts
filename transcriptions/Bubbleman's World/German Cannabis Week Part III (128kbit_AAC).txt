[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit about your honey
real quick for Bubbleman's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's honey that is collected by bees
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: They collected pollen from the anemphils
and anemphrodites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Female plants you can't do anything with.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people think you can do,
but you need pollen to make honey like
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD, or a hannep honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so this is CBD honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had the vanilla, it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice on my throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've also got a mint honey,
a Dutch honey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like hemp honey, from hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lavender, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walnuts, and lind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course cream, don't forget cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very unique product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't find it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made from the bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the purest form of CBD, or honey,
or how do you call it, hannep honey you
[SPEAKER_04]: can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we try that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd love to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to try the CBD honeycomb?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to try the hemp one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the Dutch honey, and is that the
same?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked for it, Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the honey man is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that smells just like honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to try something also?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I also got creams for your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by Bee Wax, just for skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you chew up the honeycomb,
you're left with a little tiny bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: beeswax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spit it out, or you chew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to chew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, right on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch honey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much CBD is in the jar?
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 milligrams for the whole jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I did too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's got a real hemp flavor to it,
hey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really hempy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's noticeably hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The honey is more liquid because it's hot
down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do people find you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mysterybees.com?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're from Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to put it out to 140,000
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
