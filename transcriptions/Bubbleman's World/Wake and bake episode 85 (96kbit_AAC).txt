[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome to the Wake and
Bake episode 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World and welcome
to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see quite a few of you have been
hanging out in the chat since I created
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Daryl Cornell and Peter S and Bingo
Lombardi and Banzai Breeder and Octo Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole crew already chilling and waiting
for the bakes of the wakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got my HQ shirt on today with a message,
never stop growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that could mean never stop growing
cannabis, but it could also mean never
[SPEAKER_01]: stop growing in regards to your maturity,
in regards to the evolution and the
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never stop growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, shall we bake the wake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Martin Gillis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well, my friend,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this was from HQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if they put their,
oh yeah, right on the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_01]: HQ, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their little logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a smiley face guy puffing on
a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do rinse the bong for the occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bong is a little bit dirty,
not gonna lie, but I can hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, and we're gonna be turp dipping
this morning as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was turp dipping the Jack Frost the
other day and holy shit, it is so
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminds me that I wanna let you guys know,
Canadians only, apologies for those that
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't Canadians, but those of you that
are Canadians that wanna try the turpines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can check out BlueRiverExtracts.ca and
I have a new code for 30% off your order
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is BlueRiver, all lowercase,
B-L-U-E-R-I-V-E-R-2-0-1-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: BlueRiver 2017, that is for Canadians for
the BlueRiver Canada extract site.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get yourself 30% off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 50 bucks per vial that the
discount is, so a good discount,
[SPEAKER_01]: well worth the time to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out if you're looking to get
turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks CJ Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a difficult position in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always the easiest thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have a discount code, Coot,
of course, I'm not gonna leave you
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that spaced on the
last discount code.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were a little surprised when it ended
at the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I figured it was time to make
another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna give a shirt away today,
but I don't know if I should give a small,
[SPEAKER_01]: a medium, a large, an extra large,
a double XL or a triple XL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're going Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going Congolese bubble hash rosin
dipped into Jack Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it a large, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three larges, four larges in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just give them all away,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it's gonna be a large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it's gonna be a large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of larges popping up the
screen and I think that's what it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly how I'm gonna go
about doing this because I'm just fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: playing it by ear, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing it by ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we got our carb cap from Nish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stoked on this Nish carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everyone has their dab or their
joint or their bowl or their sublingual
[SPEAKER_01]: drop patch, you know, capsule,
whatever it is, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're out there enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wake the big, shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even explain to you guys how
amazing that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: are so incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredibly tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a taste point, from a taste
standpoint without anything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it wasn't even modulating and creating
a stronger effect for me, I would still
[SPEAKER_01]: hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Frost, man, holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are the real deal, Jackie Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just cleaning up the mild,
dirt in the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cannot believe how delicious that,
really, Mike Atomic Skier, that's old
[SPEAKER_01]: school for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only, well, the company had only
really existed for about three years at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is very fucking cool that you've
been on it since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an OG, my man, you're an OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get this bowl clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a big, big banger that it's really a
job to get all around and clean it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see we got some pretty decent
cleanliness going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I think of kif rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, kif is dry sift, and what I think
about it depends on two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of the dry sift head,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: how well was it grown and how well was it
able to express itself both on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the purity of said head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the purity of the dry sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% heads, 40% heads, 99.9% heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the two factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when pressing rosin, taking rosin,
or dry sift that has been contaminated,
[SPEAKER_01]: or not, sorry, decontaminated,
so it's just maybe 20 or 30% heads,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have some effect come in
from the non-glandular material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what it is,
but it will affect the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not get as nice of a resin as if
I were to clean it out and then squish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you clean dry sift to 99.9% heads,
and you get your purity, and the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: is unveiled to be a nine, very few people
are gonna consider squishing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, there are people who
will.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be people who
will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, you really don't
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true, Jay Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: 86% of statistics are false, and that's
only in 43% of the statistical analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: that they've set up and done.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 21%, no, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a bowl, shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's three star sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know what three star sift
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I would try to stay away from
it, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make this, can I make a tiny request
if I may?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you do a wake and bake making a batch
of bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one day possibly, or in the very
near future, hopefully we'll be making
[SPEAKER_01]: some bubble hash here in Jamaica,
and I'll be able to do some videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I haven't had the real
material that I want to run to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get the greenhouse going with Ron in
the backyard here, of course we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing many, many batches of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine every morning doing a different
show, from like the building of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse over the course of a week,
from foundation to structure to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights and light depth, the whole nine
yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the planting and the soil making and
the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all the whole nine yards just to
show on every single aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now remember, we would just be sharing and
kind of learning as we go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to pretend that we're
greenhouse experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron has a lot of growing history.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows a lot about growing, but by no
means would we, it would be a learning
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys would get to be there with us for
the entire learning experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to see our successes and sort of
that's kind of the vision that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to do that right from the
start of the grow, right down to the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the grow where we're processing it
after hanging and drying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be a pretty cool show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for this greenhouse,
we would be creating living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be using the Soil Balance Pro,
the bacteria's on the roots, and we would
[SPEAKER_01]: go for as an organic option as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, potentially using biodynamic
gardening methods and tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ron and I are no strangers to
mistakes, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: People often say, oh, geez, you sound
fairly intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go to university or college?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say, no, I just made a lot of
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, yeah, I ate a lot of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked a lot of herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between those three things,
right there, brilliance can and will be
[SPEAKER_01]: attained, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja University, the school of hard
knocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants a forever flowering
greenhouse in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's for sure not going to be a
forever flowering greenhouse smash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to Eric and but I've talked to
some other companies and some other people
[SPEAKER_01]: who represent greenhouse, including Brian
from Vital Garden Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what greenhouse we're kind of
like, listen, should we just go blow 50
[SPEAKER_01]: G's on a greenhouse or should we see the
value that this particular show could
[SPEAKER_01]: have, how much advertising that it'll be
for this particular greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on which one we buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just figured there could be some
reciprocity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to say that we deserve a
free greenhouse, although you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a company out there that
feels that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to take the money that we have
for investment, put it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what, we're gonna give a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this greenhouse is the one and it's
really, really amazing and useful,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that they will be making a lot
of sales through greenhouse sales through
[SPEAKER_01]: these videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think these videos over the
course of time would probably gather up
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if each one was only getting 10 or
15,000 like a hash church, if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: through the 146 hash churches,
there's well over a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Views there already, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, we're not haggling at all,
Canna Stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very ready to go and just do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone had mentioned, why would you
do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so much to offer in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could work out a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working at a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to get a good price.
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly haven't asked for a free one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free one would be amazing, but I'm not one
to ask for free ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I do have people contact
me on the regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it works out and when I see the
value of their social media, or where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're sharing, I've been known to give
away free bags and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what Canna Stones was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to read everyone's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you for letting me know and
keeping me on the right track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to talk to Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Eric actually said was that he
would try to match the best deal that we
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish he would have just said,
here, this is the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have decided whether it was
something for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could have already ordered the
greenhouse and have it on its way here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Ron has already taken the cuts
from the Congo plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the greenhouse cuts are already vegging
and rooting as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to get on it sooner than
later, probably hit him up in the near
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have him back on Hash Church
maybe in the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have Brian from Vital Gardens
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have Peter from Soil Balance
Pro come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the regular panelists and
maybe even a few new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Jordan, I'm not interested in entering
the market that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entering the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I could help with my distribution to
help sell greenhouses if I found one that
[SPEAKER_01]: I really loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally do that with all things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I love something, I'll try to promote
it and let people know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the glass cleaner, I don't get
paid from the glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a few free bottles,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I could have kept the 14 that
he sent for giveaway if I really wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, I was giving those away and
I think I have maybe one left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I'm definitely giving a t-shirt
away, but I haven't figured out how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come to be just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Peter's very good, Cuban.
[SPEAKER_01]: He impressed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like his vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if we do greenhouses in Jamaica,
natural alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica can just do fields and they're so
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll really be dependent upon where our
grows are and what kind of weather and
[SPEAKER_01]: insect variables happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll learn those things as we have
been learning them over the course of the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years with the small research and
development projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you need my help for, Richard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Campbell,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the greenhouse going to be just
Congolese?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking it might be sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't decided that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're talking pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what we'll be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice early wake and bake only 904.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm yawning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had what have I had one rip?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have only had one rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have another rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to go into the Bruce
Banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, little Bruce Banner turps left
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why Congolese?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you grow what you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I hope the answer is not
because that's what the market dictates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that that's the worst answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good that people have an
interest in cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that the market's been so
controlled by the monopoly that is
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I.e., only people really willing to break
the law play the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't really bring the best of the
best of the best of the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people who could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, some people are worried about
these new, fresh people that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into the scene and getting on cannabis
because they weren't involved for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm welcoming it personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see the excitement from
the new group of young people that come up
[SPEAKER_01]: and get degrees and go and study
agriculture and botany and sciences and go
[SPEAKER_01]: and travel around the world to countries
that are now legally producing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, to me, is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very much so looking forward to just
all of that, how that's going to play out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next 10 to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some exceptional people are going to come
into this with exceptional minds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to execute their ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's all going to benefit us a
great deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we don't have to deny the fact
that prohibition did not benefit all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So removing prohibition should benefit the
scene in a very, very good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna Pussy's in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like I might have to ban hammer
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look like Adam West's stuntman.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam West.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Batman?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Adam West?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is this like a new Adam West that I'm
old?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking Batman from the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boof!
[SPEAKER_01]: Bap!
[SPEAKER_01]: Kapow!
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, your bubble hash won't bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can teach you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to grow better weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even being a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to grow better weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You called fresh headies left an email
because your bubble hash won't melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, all bubble hash does.
[SPEAKER_01]: All bubble bags does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isolates the glandular trichome heads
from the rest of the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your quality is up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with how well you've offered those
genetics what they require.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, call it a narrow leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the super, super narrowest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people ask that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, do some Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm googling on microplaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microplaning is simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezing the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezing your tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breaking the pieces into small little
squares so when you're microplaning the
[SPEAKER_01]: warmth of your hands don't melt the patty
and kind of become a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to be shredding heads
generally when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which will give the effect of a more melty
hash even when the hash is not melty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it as a cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see fresh frozen microplained hash as a
cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that if I take that hash and I
leave it out at room temperature it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to butter out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not going to melt as nice
towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just like to sieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: That half of you fucks are only here for
the giveaways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you read someone's like
just even like because you might not have
[SPEAKER_01]: said it like in a kind of hateful way but
when you read it it's like oh my goodness
[SPEAKER_01]: like he just called half the people in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're here for bottom line is no
judgments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here and that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're here because you want to get
some win some shit well that's fine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still hearing what's said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be because at any point in
time the question could come that could
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to the caret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the t-shirts that I'm giving away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you catch that reference?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really trying to lead you guys at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving shit away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that it'll end one day but it
seems like a fun thing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People keep sending me little boxes of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love carrots too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb Gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you won something Herb Gardener?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I sent anything to you Herb Gardener?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well what size carrot would you be Herb
Gardener?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to send say a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size carrot would you be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be like a small carrot or like a
medium carrot or would it be like a double
[SPEAKER_01]: XL carrot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of like what kind of range of
carrot would you happen to be in if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were in the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to check in dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: XL will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I don't know if I have an XL bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can check real quick but I think that's
the one I don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the one I took.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact she sent me one of almost every

office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And send this shit off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sound Russian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I do often do a Russian accent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do enough accents over the course
of your life sometimes they just become
[SPEAKER_01]: you know little voices that will come out
whenever they need to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's done with love.

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Quinn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your buddies were all around and they were
like oh our buddy was supposed to come
[SPEAKER_01]: here and he's like your biggest fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like well I can't remember if
they said can we call him or if I said
[SPEAKER_01]: let's call him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said can we call him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure man I'll talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a dude after all.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are always like wow that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a famous person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like above anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like if it's and I love good
vibes I love like happiness and smiles and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone go what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean FSS the other day was so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just called him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey what's up dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh fuck it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell he he changed his whole vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah didn't you end up coming down Mike
Quinn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't I end up meeting you after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there again though at the Karma
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna have Blue River terpenes and should
be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes yes father Mike I am the bubble man
hash dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what more than being a hero I
will take that compliment which is you
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me not fuck up my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I'm here for to help
people not fuck up their hash and really
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's for a personal agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be greedy and selfish in the sense
that when I bump into you I want your hash
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the best hash possible so that when
you share it with me the enjoyable
[SPEAKER_01]: experience is that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bar is that much higher set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so perhaps it's a little bit greedy of
me but I feel like give that information
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to come back not just to me but
to anyone to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean shit when someone makes great hash
and then they smoke it with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing let's talk about the
responsibility factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of growing great weed and making great
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about that next level shit
above a nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so next level that it could cause
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could cause discomfort in people and
when you have hash or oil of that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important to when
turning someone on new when it's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: showing them concentrate for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to try and destroy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be like a childish immature high
school kid and I apologize if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: high school right now watching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all high school kids are immature but
I was a bit immature and you know we you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we thought it was funny like oh give
him a big glob give him a you know like we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to hurt people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to turn people off and these
are powerful substances in the sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: when taking a concentrate for the first
time in a larger dose than is necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get really really really stoned
and that's not our intention when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to turn the mainstream onto
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could show them that listen yes this is
very strong if you ate enough I could
[SPEAKER_01]: probably do a surgery on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoked enough you could potentially
create an uncomfortable or a level of
[SPEAKER_01]: discomfort that is maybe more than you
have experienced in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that said it's also a powerful
medicine and when using like micro micro
[SPEAKER_01]: micro amounts especially for newbies for
people who have never done this before you
[SPEAKER_01]: know for people that we want to be able to
enjoy cannabis but if we come at them and
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy them with something so powerful
and I see it happen all the time to me
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing the work of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not on the right side of things
it's not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroy yourself destroy your friends that
request it but don't destroy people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are who are have never had a rip ever in
their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really try to turn them on in a proper way
which is in my opinion a micro dose
[SPEAKER_01]: something so small that first of all when
they see it versus the ones they've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: you give all the other people in the room
including yourself it's like a tenth or
[SPEAKER_01]: twentieth of what you took maybe even a
fiftieth if you're taking really big dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take overly huge dabs I mean even
this right here would probably be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit bigger than what I would take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now don't get me wrong I could take a huge
dab I just find it wasteful and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy it quite as much as I enjoy you know
a really nice proper size dab that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: finish in one rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes you did Rick Fondelier but do not
worry we will be giving more things away
[SPEAKER_01]: in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're talking about etiquette
we're talking about when someone is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke their concentrate or hashish with
someone for the first time someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: has maybe never been exposed to it maybe
they have a bit of experience with joints
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they have no experience with joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about really showing
people how to micro dab and get them the
[SPEAKER_01]: smallest amount so that if they request
another one they can have another one no
[SPEAKER_01]: problem but if you give them too much it's
hard to now say can you get rid of this
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling I'm having an anxiety attack and I
was just kind of saying that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to be turning people on that
way that's not that's not the way to show
[SPEAKER_01]: someone into the wonderful world of
cannabis by producing a really
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable experience exactly cartwheel
that as well super low temp micro dose not
[SPEAKER_01]: like super huge rip hot as fuck like man
so many people putting that so many people
[SPEAKER_01]: putting that on the nail it's not even
funny like unbelievable like rippling hot
[SPEAKER_01]: rips this creates an effect of burning and
harshness and coughing that in itself is
[SPEAKER_01]: an experience that is not really enjoyable
now combine that with extremely high
[SPEAKER_01]: someone for the first time just take a
huge dab like that it's just not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: combination I think that cannabis deserves
better representation and I hope that you
[SPEAKER_01]: all can respect that when turning new
people on to cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: through dabs especially yeah pens aren't
too bad for sure you know that's a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a great way but you know what I like to
show them dabbing I like to would you know
[SPEAKER_01]: why oil would taste like sulfur yes I
would absolutely know why your oil would
[SPEAKER_01]: taste like sulfur you're not going to like
it it's a product called defender it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of other names it's a smoker they
spray it kind of a fogger they spray it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of for powdery mildew it's when you
have massive amounts of powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that because when you can see
powdery mildew generally you'll have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: so a good way to find out this and I do it
before I run anything because of back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day in the 90s oh it's nasty pharmacy
I made 28 grams of Renee bubble hash like
[SPEAKER_01]: full melt the most beautiful blonde it
would have turned to an amber golden
[SPEAKER_01]: amazingness smelt like pounds of weed like
just the most beautiful hash and it's it
[SPEAKER_01]: had sulfur I hadn't checked I was learning
about this so I hucked it right off my
[SPEAKER_01]: deck and just said goodbye to it no need
for that it's contaminant it's not good it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to go there's no way to get it out
and yeah powdery mildew powdery mildew is
[SPEAKER_01]: a nightmare from hell this is a problem
when you have people growing cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that have never had to fight mildews
because they grew up in dry arid mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: ranges not in the jungle or in the in the
rainforest of the Pacific Northwest you
[SPEAKER_01]: know temperate rainforest we have a lot of
humidity and a lot of rain here so these
[SPEAKER_01]: are the wrong cultivars to be growing and
because of it you get a lot of powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew that grows on these plants
Congolese for instance is resilient to
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew because it grew in a jungle
it's used to moisture and humidity and so
[SPEAKER_01]: over the course of time that that plant
was was bred and selected by humans it
[SPEAKER_01]: chose to build itself resiliencies now
whether that's the terpene profile I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's likely which is one of the
reasons we grow it right because we want
[SPEAKER_01]: that unique terpene profile I don't want
to plant a bunch of cushions in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse behind my house and have
powdery mildew come in and take out the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole the whole crop yeah exactly pharmacy
that's why people do breed their own
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars the sulfur comes from the
product it's a powdery mildew it's like I
[SPEAKER_01]: think what it really does is it changes
the pH of the leaf it attacks powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew in some way but it's not in any way
Anna you're still going at it eh you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm just gonna go poo I don't know
maybe it's a little bit harsh but gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: keep that bandhammer on the fresh fresh
hammer out still can't get the image of
[SPEAKER_01]: those mites and webs on those plants oh my
god are you kidding me dude don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: listen for real I'll tell you something
that gave me like an anxiety attack when I
[SPEAKER_01]: saw that like I got dizzy and my heart
started beating and I could feel blood
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping much the way you would if you were
getting say pulled over with a trunk full
[SPEAKER_01]: of herb very much like that feeling just
looking at that whoo those mites all over
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant like what a bummer there's just
nothing good about that I would never go
[SPEAKER_01]: in that room I wouldn't even film his
phone I would be worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-contamination even over the internet
oof gross is right thanks for bringing it
[SPEAKER_01]: up my god whoo well 32 minutes and 47
seconds I think we did pretty good I see
[SPEAKER_01]: herb the herb gardener has sent me his
email so I'll probably head down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: post office and get this stuff off to all
of you and in the meantime I hope everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: has a great day I hope they all have oh
it's not a pic Matthew it's located on
[SPEAKER_01]: hash church when Tony showed his phone
with a video of mites it was the video
[SPEAKER_01]: that made it so much worse it really was
it has been 33 minutes actually did I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: get my email from episode 81 I believe I
did I don't know what your email was about
[SPEAKER_01]: or what but if it was an email that said
your address and you won something then I
[SPEAKER_01]: would suspect it's been shipped off just
recently I shipped off like eight or nine
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I had saved up so sure Alex QC
why not have a bong right before before we
[SPEAKER_01]: leave why not we'll do a little ripper put
that right there get this party this party
[SPEAKER_00]: started ooh bong rip then trim jail you
know I was never a fan of trim jail I seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to recall you saying don't be nervous I
take rips that would crush you so I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just being funny I'm not like ego
competitive in my dabbing at all I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: claim to take the biggest drips I just
felt like that was kind of a comedic thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to say didn't you didn't you kind of enjoy
it on a comedian level on a comic level
[SPEAKER_01]: comical level that would crush your soul
all right violator yeah never stop being
[SPEAKER_01]: funny it's all about being funny I was a
class clown if you can imagine I always
[SPEAKER_01]: liked making people laugh I thought it was
like a noble person suit to put a smile on
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's face just seemed like the good
thing to do let's do this
[SPEAKER_01]: can still taste the turps from the last
dip I didn't even dip that how the hell is
[SPEAKER_01]: that possible like the bong is just fully
turped quite delicious when are they just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna leave us alone hey when are they
just gonna leave us alone let us have this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant one thing after another it would
seem fully turped de-chassed a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: dark here where it's reclaiming but
that'll clean out real nice as long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: banger itself the dish is clean have I
ever had my rig turned blue from turps no
[SPEAKER_01]: no I have not what is that Tuzeline or
Hugh I can't remember the name of it Jim
[SPEAKER_01]: Frayer posted it a few times about be man
rips would cripple me only I only vape
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers well you know what that's why we
all get this is the beautiful thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that the bioassay and that's why
I say be respectful for people because
[SPEAKER_01]: when they don't know what level they sit
at when they're coming in fresh it's best
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to bring them in smooth and nice
not to like yank them in in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: that is discomforting for them so cannabis
can be powerful is oil that tastes like
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur dangerous to consume well you know
what I'm not gonna say that it's do you
[SPEAKER_01]: try to I wouldn't say I trust inhaling it
like what was the sulfur sprayed for is it
[SPEAKER_01]: was it mildew obviously so you have mildew
and and sulfur that you're inhaling these
[SPEAKER_01]: to me don't seem to be like I don't think
people have been inhaling them for
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of years safely the way they
have been cannabis I have faith in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cannabis produces terpene
profiles and cannabinoid profiles that
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to have been over the course of this
last several thousands of years safe for
[SPEAKER_01]: human consumption so sulfur it's bad man
it's bad you know and if I know it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: hard thing because but it's education
right I know I know so what you got to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is you got to educate the people around
you to stop purchasing herb from this guy
[SPEAKER_01]: who's selling sulfurated herb you also
have to educate him first and foremost so
[SPEAKER_01]: you give him the chance to stop on his own
if he doesn't stop then you just have to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of convince the people around you
that are your friends at least that that
[SPEAKER_01]: is no bueno and to try and seek out a
better source because you know it's supply
[SPEAKER_01]: and demand it's your you're the demand so
he produces it the grower if this guy
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to sell it will keep spraying
his shit with powdery with sulfur powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew is horrible it's like spores so if
his grow has it he's gonna have to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: strip everything down and clean that shit
with a nuclear bomb in order to rid
[SPEAKER_01]: himself of those spores they really are
hard to kill spore we talked about it on
[SPEAKER_01]: hash church a couple of weeks ago or maybe
even last week I think it was Peter from
[SPEAKER_01]: soil balance pro talking about the powdery
mildew spore and how intense it is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bowling ball actually is what he
referenced it to so yeah troubles troubles
[SPEAKER_01]: hate to makes me feel a little dirty
talking about it I'm not gonna lie a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit dirty oh wow that's insane wow
that's crazy isn't that the power of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis you know laughed for the first
time since the Holocaust that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: serious statement when you think about it
ideally I picture that the woman has been
[SPEAKER_01]: through hell during the Holocaust has not
laughed for the rest of her entire life
[SPEAKER_01]: and then at 78 tries cannabis Wow thank
you for bringing can laughter back into my
[SPEAKER_01]: life that's not too bad one of the many
beauties of cannabis you know another
[SPEAKER_01]: biological function laughter and happiness
have you ever had to throw a crop away
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble man I have thrown a crop away yes
Andrew Driscoll I did right before Johnny
[SPEAKER_01]: B went through his house that's why I
actually stopped growing for quite a while
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B gave me some clones and I had
been to his grow before and everything was
[SPEAKER_01]: fine but he gave me some clones and it had
some mildew on it and the minute I saw it
[SPEAKER_01]: like and I saw just one little kind of
leaf had a circle on it I just killed
[SPEAKER_01]: everything now it wasn't a huge crop but I
just got rid of it and I cleaned all the
[SPEAKER_01]: tents and I stopped growing it's been over
a year since I grew anything so I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of safe like that I'll be very very
confident when we bring the greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's no powdery mildew here and
that you know people who have gardens will
[SPEAKER_01]: also kind of go through a specific SOP
before they're allowed anywhere it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be like an open like hey you know
come on over to the greenhouse gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a little bit stronger on the SOP
than that but I will see how it plays out
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Ron and I are learning and it's
gonna be a fun experience I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have Ron back in my life that's one of the
things I'm most excited about having him
[SPEAKER_01]: back in my life and back in my family's
life super super excited about it so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't let this one fall to the wayside it
has to happen and I'm gonna keep talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it until it does so with that said
may the full mouth bless your bowls sooner
[SPEAKER_01]: than later bubble man is out peace you you
