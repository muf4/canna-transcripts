[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Man here with Andrew from Sample
Automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He flew out from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: New Hampshire, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: New England.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came from New England.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in the car, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we've been talking, myself and
Corey, his partner who's responsible for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the cannabis-based information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew, you're more focused on the
software, the sensors, all the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: hardware.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Andrew's going to walk us through the
Rosin Reactor today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, well, we've got about 1,800
grams of Apricot Kush Rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of looks like peanut brittle right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get this into the Rosin
Reactor, which is right over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to have Andrew walk us
through what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How it works, break down all the
components, the software, the brain,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys will have a great
understanding of why it's important to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a piece of machinery like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so you can avoid watching bubbles
as you decarboxylate and stabilize your
[SPEAKER_02]: resin for vapor carts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'll put it over to you, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our Rosin Reactor system comprises
of three main components.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a laptop, which is going to hold
your software.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our calculator, you've got a control
box, which can control two individual
[SPEAKER_01]: vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third is our vessel slash mantle
assembly with our manifold on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way this system works, it's able to
track both the ambient air temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pressure of the vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the internal product temperature,
as well as you can then control the
[SPEAKER_01]: ventilation and burping of gas,
as well as the inert charge of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: gas inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then can fully control the mantle,
and we are able to monitor the internal
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of the heating element to dial
in the exact temperature and track
[SPEAKER_01]: everything both on screen, as well as
control all the components of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of this control box is our brain,
as well as the temperature controller that
[SPEAKER_01]: will communicate both the brain,
but also control the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of this manifold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, mantle, apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different vessel sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a one-liter vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a half liter vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two liters, three liters,
and five liters, respectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all simply attach with a
three-eighths compression fitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've got the one vessel right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plugged into over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This manifold is all plugged into here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also another one on the
other side that you're not seeing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what he was meaning in regards
to you can run two of these systems off of
[SPEAKER_02]: one brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The software itself will actually run four
brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll run up to four brains, so you can
have up to eight vessels all of varying
[SPEAKER_01]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just simply stuck it out depending on
what your process requires as a facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, beautiful, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So explain to people why this is better
than, I mean, this is a very simple
[SPEAKER_02]: question, and I know the answer myself,
but why are people going to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in, instead of using vac ovens
and watching the bubbles finally stop in
[SPEAKER_02]: their material to figure out their decarb
time, what is this going to offer us that
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to sort of take it to the next
level, preserve volatile organic
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, and ensure that the THCA has
been converted to THC so that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have crystallization in your carts?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found is the usual process of
decarb oxylation obviously creates CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: which generates a pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that, the typical tech has always
been to watch the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens when you get towards the
end of that process is there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation of delta-9 and terpenes that
occurs that starts to hide any of that
reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see it on screen here,
but I'll briefly show you on one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: brochures, is you can see there is a
taper-off to the green line of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That taper-off could take two to three
times longer than what you initially
[SPEAKER_01]: expect, meaning the last 15, maybe 10% of
THCA that you believe is no longer inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of that material is still remaining in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it won't show until five to ten days
later after you've filled all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: product into cartridges, which can occur
either crystallization or cloudy
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges where you lose the perfect
clarity that you should have to create the
[SPEAKER_01]: most optimal product and preserve the most
amount of terpenes while doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like the microscopic
crystallization of THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not creating giant crystals,
but they're just these microscopic ones
[SPEAKER_02]: and they do create a very sort of cloudy,
not ideal for shelf look.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You additionally have some more controls
where everything in terms of this software
[SPEAKER_01]: is all built in as one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a logging function that you can
start and stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can disengage and engage the tanks
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can charge them as well as discharge
from buttons on screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The system is designed to work away from a
laptop where if you have a TV connected,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually pull out the graphs and
you can move these to different screens if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also, if we had multiple tanks,
you can turn this graph into a multi graph
[SPEAKER_01]: setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had four tanks, you can show all
four graphs all at once, or you can show
[SPEAKER_01]: all four graphs on a TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole system is network connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't actually need this laptop to
stay with the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can place this laptop wherever you'd
like in a facility, simply plug it into
[SPEAKER_01]: your network, connect the software and
everything can be controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can simply leave up and display
everything that is going on, but none of
[SPEAKER_01]: your users will have control of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a specific individual in your
facility needs to be able to get access to
[SPEAKER_01]: that computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The workaround we found is we use a
program called AnyDesk to give you remote
[SPEAKER_01]: control and you can simply place that on
an iPad and walk around your facility and
[SPEAKER_01]: connect into the computer wherever it is
in your facility and remote control it
[SPEAKER_01]: right in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the software itself comes as a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a calculator that works in
combination with this that allows you to
[SPEAKER_01]: input the initial product amount,
the volume of your vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your target temperature, your target
amount, or whether it's known or unknown,
[SPEAKER_01]: your amount of THCA that's inside of the
material, and it will help you calculate a
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity of events that it believes will
be the complete process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then use that in combination of our
venting, which we consider a frequency,
[SPEAKER_01]: to create an estimated time target that
will allow a user to be able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, accomplish a full production with
no issues of cloudy carts that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: rely on and repeat over and over and over
again at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And discharge, the button discharge that's
for venting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so right now we have everything set
up in a manual or an automatic mode,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if I go into my controller settings
and turn it to our manual function,
[SPEAKER_01]: our discharge button will now individually
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our charge button will work at any
period of time, but we control that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This play button up here, this is the
controls to your temperature controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's only set on a single
profile line, so you can set this into
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple profiles if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has just got one, but you can add up
to ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will work their way down it and you
have days, hours, and minutes which they
[SPEAKER_01]: can work through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you simply hit play, all that will
happen, it will come up and advise you,
[SPEAKER_01]: your set point is that, it will tell you
your heater set point, and it has now
[SPEAKER_01]: changed everything for the temperature
controller to start heating that mantle
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly to the temperature you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you press stop, it simply kills that
temperature and it will send it back down
[SPEAKER_00]: to a value of zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat is off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're going to be using the one
litre vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corey was talking about leaving about a
half a litre of head space for the
[SPEAKER_02]: material, so we've figured out that'll
probably be around 700 to 750 grams of
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have also marked the vessel so that
when it goes into here, we'll see that the
[SPEAKER_02]: tape line, the top of the tape line is
right where it goes to, and so we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want the rosin going above this tape line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll ensure us that we have enough head
space with the lid of the unit plus the
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of extra space here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be about half a litre.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 500 mil of head space, that's one
litre, so we know no matter what as you go
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, we spec vessels based on a body
size, and then our head always has a known
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of air space for that head space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always calculating the fact that
it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that Corey has found the most
unique out of this is the relative
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature change between inside of this
mantle and the top of this glass vessel
[SPEAKER_01]: creates the condensation of terpenes,
and you get a reflux, and you will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually recode because that temperature
shift is so drastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be 150 to 175 degrees in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is about 80 degrees on top of that
glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we can start with throwing our
rosin into the reactor, and then we'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of program we're going to run it
through and start this decarb.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so put a little bit of rosin in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually coming out a little easier
than I thought it might.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going to have to get the vessel
teared and onto the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Onto the scale, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get the weight of that on its own,
if you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did tear it already?
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be 1115.85.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1116.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1116.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just a little bit of,
it's kind of got that round bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picks that quickly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so see if we can't get this
rosin into that vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice when you're in a cold room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can actually get away with
touching.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where these silly gloves will come
in handy that I've got on the way here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I want to grab it from the
bottom, but I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make it worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hands are going to be stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get it figured out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be a nightmare,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so 1116 to 1400.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a little bit less than half
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take this glove off and throw
on a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calculator out as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just under 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: We managed to get some out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was impressive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So work like this could be done in the
cold room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how stuck it needs to be
before it actually releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really kind of have to cut it from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want it to be too thick
because I don't want it to hit the sides
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can avoid it, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that fall down naturally.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1817 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I say that's probably more than
enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tear weight, gross weight is,
well, it's minus the 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about 700, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gross weight is 1817.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minus 1116.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, 1116.
[SPEAKER_01]: 701.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1817.
[SPEAKER_02]: Base is 42.
[SPEAKER_02]: That weight is 701.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you do the... Oh, no, I didn't know
the end was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll do them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our raws in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got about 700 grams in here,
into the vessel and then into the reactor
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you simply place it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've placed a small little
O-ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an O-ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes with every vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That simply gets placed into the groove
that's literally listed on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to create your seal and your
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to slide the mantle
underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a little stainless tray to make
sure everything nicely fits underneath and
[SPEAKER_01]: stays balanced towards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that little guy right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have much better stands that we provide
on the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's the demo ship easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're doing... Line up your probe
centrally and then you're simply going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold your head and loosen your two clamps
to allow everything to slide down.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that slides, the probe will just press
straight into the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see that in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probe is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all we're going to do is use the
clamp which has a preset nut attachment
[SPEAKER_01]: and has a wing clamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply going to just press it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember these things are tight
because it's a seal that you're holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that that came off there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just probably a little
piece of that little thing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that's now sealed in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rosin Reactor is almost ready to go.
That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we don't have any nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to just do, we're going to
assume that I did a pressure test of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vessel before it came here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it's going to be sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But effectively we're going to make sure
we've got all of our settings correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going through the settings here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in Rosin Reactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a Fahrenheit temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a temperature control setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our logging file.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want our pathway for our folder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to prompt for a file name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then have our logging time interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will log on a 30 second interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also instructions on the right
hand side for all your settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're then going to go to our tank
settings and switch to go into our auto
[SPEAKER_01]: high-low mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gloves don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enable our discharge mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've now lost control of our manual
discharge button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've set our trigger values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our higher trigger value is five PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our low trigger value is one PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close our screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we hit start, it's going to erase
the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are then going to leave this as our
file name, unless you want to change it to
[SPEAKER_01]: what you had for your, to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: RP two three dot zero zero two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess we could add the D
because when it comes out, when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: finished, it'll be decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll save that as our file name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to save and log as a CSV
file.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two things have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the logging has started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your graph is erased to restart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started tracking the release rate for
PSI per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has started the heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the release rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got discharge mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got ambient temp, product temp,
heater set point, heater temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as pressure low, pressure high,
and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Effectively the five on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this release rate will only exist
when logging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will disappear when not logging,
but everything from the midpoint up is
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from the midpoint down is
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got it set at 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to let it sit and let it
increase in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is starting to auto tune to get to
the exact temperature of 180 degrees and
[SPEAKER_01]: set as a fixed temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to simply sit back and
wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do some waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just asked Andrew, you know,
what we're actually waiting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave a good explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go through that real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've now started the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for an initial build of
temperature right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our product temperature is only at 55
degrees, which means we most likely aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: having any kind of reaction take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to wait until our product
temperature stabilizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that stabilizes, you will then start
to generate a frequency of venting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that frequency of venting allows you
to determine a time scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a known count of total bursts
that you're aiming for, and you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency of those bursts, our calculator
then helps to determine an estimated time
[SPEAKER_01]: scale for that entire process,
which helps to that very last 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part that's the biggest catch
because you've gotten 90% of the way there
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've just hurt yourself by pulling
it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll wait till it gets up to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll wait till it starts creating that
pattern for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what do we do at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're then going to simply use that
temperature and that ventilation frequency
[SPEAKER_01]: to determine what works for our time
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going too long, we're going to
increase that temperature, which should
[SPEAKER_01]: then reduce the frequency and reduce the
time of the time in between bursts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore you're having faster reaction
and we're going to target the right
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature to time process that works for
both your facility as well as for the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest retention of these volatiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: One last thing I was asking Andrew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we got to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to sit around and we got to watch
this thing now and wait for it to get up
[SPEAKER_02]: to temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, man, we're going to go to lunch
because everything is controllable on your
[SPEAKER_01]: phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a program that every single
laptop is provided with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a name and a password.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the PC and you'll be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I can control everything
that is taking place on that tank and
[SPEAKER_01]: computer from my phone from our lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can simply just go out to lunch,
monitor the entire process, go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was why we would say to people,
if you want to connect it into a network
[SPEAKER_01]: and have a main PC, like we see here,
but that PC is actually located in the
[SPEAKER_01]: manager's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then somebody who's that manager,
if they have an iPad, they can very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: still be in this room and control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the only person that can control
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will there be a subscription that you
guys offer down the line where you kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: can help monitor for people that don't
know what they're doing maybe as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kind of give them a little bit
of hand holding where they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're about to do a batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little light comes on or you get an
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you guys are monitoring for them and
kind of maybe doing some of the math and
[SPEAKER_02]: organizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can tell you what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell them how to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corey, who's my colleague, he will sit
down and we have a package that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will give you, I think it's about six
hours of time remotely for dialing in your
[SPEAKER_01]: process, working on calculations and
determining everything you want to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it both works as a consultation aid as
well as a, I guess the best way to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a specific model that works for your
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call it white glove service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just came in to do a quick check and
Andrew's just going to point out a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of safety features that he got put in
based on a friend who worked at OSHA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just told me this, so he's going to be
repeating it for the second time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I thought it was important for you
guys as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead, Andrew, the importance of,
so we have a glass vessel that is pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: rated to 135 PSI at a hundred degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: The manifolds all have a adjustable PRV,
which can be a plunger can be added for an
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency relief if you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then have an analog pressure gauge and
a manual ball valve and they're all on it
[SPEAKER_01]: for worst case scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: situations where the vessel needs to be
relieved immediately of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was ever to go over a certain amount
of pressure, or if you don't have any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of connection to this for any reason,
you still know what's going on in this
[SPEAKER_01]: entire process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you definitely in the SOPs want to
always make sure that you're checking
[SPEAKER_02]: this, making sure that it's closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if it's open, I guess we're never
going to be gaining any pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I wanted to cover
with you, Andrew was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a few different things that can
fail on the unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is it to troubleshoot if
something fails, walk us through what that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basic troubleshooting you can use by
the software where there are two buttons
[SPEAKER_01]: onto it for discharge and charge that
control both of your two solenoids for
[SPEAKER_01]: discharging and charging.
[SPEAKER_01]: By clicking them, you can simply easily
check there's an LED on top of each
[SPEAKER_01]: solenoid that will flash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do it now because it's
currently running live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to the internals, you have two
temperature controllers that can easily be
[SPEAKER_01]: taken out by two bolts and our main brain,
which is effectively an embedded PCP board
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's held on by four screws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you simply switch the board out and
that's the main component change.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, that's actually it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have your two solenoids,
you have this little plunger piece inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get to the inside of that valve if
you need to, by taking off that nut,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get to the physical shaft,
which can be unscrewed off the valve body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can clean all the seals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get fully inside to it and then
screw it all back together again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath it, you have a seven micron
particulate filter that once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can easily take out the filter,
put it into an alcohol bath, clean it and
[SPEAKER_01]: simply place it right back in again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, you can always adjust your
automatic PRV.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go higher or lower,
everything is set to 35 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, everything is a basic
component switch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sensor for your temperature and your
pressure is held on by a standard
[SPEAKER_01]: compression fitting as well as your
temperature probe is held on by a standard
[SPEAKER_01]: compression fitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of your sensors and solenoids are
attached by M12 four-way automation
[SPEAKER_01]: cables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that goes down to a single
12-way cable going into your board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fairly easy to troubleshoot and find a
problem if you have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fixing and replacing pieces are
incredibly easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept is you need one Allen key set
to fix everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, now you've seen the Rosin Reactor
in action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I was unable to get
footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't there for the finishing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it took us around 14 hours per 700
grams that we ran.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did end up doing about 2,700 or just
over two and a half kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it into carts, which I can show you
the picture of the cart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice color.
[SPEAKER_02]: The color in the labs when you're doing
video, the Rosin looked much darker than
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked kind of like a peanut butter,
but it was quite yellow, amberish color in
[SPEAKER_02]: the vape carts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste was absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are waiting for the final COA in
regards to showing that we got a terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corey did hit me up the other day and let
me know that he was getting a substantial
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in terpenes from a couple of
batches that he did recently in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're quite excited with the unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to admit taste-wise,
decarboxylation-wise, we had the COA come
[SPEAKER_02]: in and it was like 100% decarbed to
perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this really allows you to get that 100%
decarb and get it accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not watching bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're able to monitor through your phone,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be using the Rosin Reactor
here for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone has any interest or questions
about the Rosin Reactor, please feel free
[SPEAKER_02]: to reach out to me at bcbubbleman.com,
or sorry, bcbubblemanaticloud.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can send you some information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hook you guys up with the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to be helping them remove some
units here in Canada and hopefully in the
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in all, we're quite happy with the
White Glove service.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're quite happy with the fact that Corey
was monitoring the decarb each and every
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we're just, you know,
more tools to be created for the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're in that are designed
specifically for these jobs rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: jerry-rigging and doing things sort of
half-assed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys have any questions,
I will try to do a follow-up video
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually showing the final process of us
opening the unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you allow the unit to heat up,
the rosin can be quite viscous and that
[SPEAKER_02]: way you can take that and pour it right
into your filling machines if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: vape carts or get it back into whatever
vessel you want to have it in before you
[SPEAKER_02]: get it into, you know, edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, please subscribe and we'll talk
to you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
