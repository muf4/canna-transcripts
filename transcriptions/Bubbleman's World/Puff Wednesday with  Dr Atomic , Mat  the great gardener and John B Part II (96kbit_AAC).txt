[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that, didn't interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a new friend in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt just rolled in.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to have you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just met the doc.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, big honor for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool, very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just watched the video the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, aw man, I gotta meet him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Atomic Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the strains that we lost in
the 2004 raid on Vickree in Victoria with
[SPEAKER_05]: the Vicks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the strains that we
absolutely lost.
06?
[SPEAKER_04]: 04.
[SPEAKER_04]: 04.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been gone for 10 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was super popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it is very much like it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is software, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've bred it and you've worked with
it and you've created your own sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: species, I feel if you don't want to share
it, then don't share it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give it to anybody and then say,
hey I gave it to you and then don't share
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want it and you want to keep it
private, keep it private.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's like a cut that's out there,
it's out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just share it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty open with my genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because for me it's the medicinal
side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it makes somebody feel better,
then I think the plant needs to be out
[SPEAKER_05]: there making people feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took the barb home the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb by the old Shishkeberry line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the strains that you
grabbed from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pretty nice little strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had an old friend come up to me in
London.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we'll be able to bring some
pure Shishkeberry back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shishkeberry I think was another strain
that we lost in the Vickree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Raid along with the Princess.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Princess for us and the Vicks was the
number one painkiller overall medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: strain that we had.
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't keep it on the menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sold, sold, sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was another one that was lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to hit some of that barb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb-ra.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The award-winning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just did some Fresh Frozen yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I was looking at that picture today.
[SPEAKER_05]: That piece was solidified like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it into the sieve to scrape it and I
had to put it into the freezer to sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: chunk it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be key is temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the same problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you saw my last video of
the Astro Boy Fresh Frozen that I went to
[SPEAKER_02]: run through my strainer and then it just
went and just I was like oh put it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer for like two hours took it out
smacked it with a hard cold spoon that was
[SPEAKER_02]: also in the freezer and it just broke like
glass on top of the parchment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We stuffed it in for like 10 minutes or
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just enough to sort of get that gumminess
off and we weren't able to get it through
[SPEAKER_05]: the sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We threw a wet piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sizzled away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just white.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like did you see that one shot?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the same color of the scrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I liked it and even commented on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drooled when I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I told Doc about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you grab the barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was like grab that one because it
produces resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a strain that should be bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is a genetic trait then it should
be somehow isolated and passed on into
[SPEAKER_02]: other strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was running.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Warlock Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean the Warlock.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Warlock is up there for producing
dynamite hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I crossed it with the Kanatonic and
all the phenols that are coming off of it
[SPEAKER_05]: they're great but the hash doesn't produce
the quantity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it in the big tumbler.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do the hour run and you're like.
[SPEAKER_05]: You open it up and you're just like hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know it fills a fairly good
container up.
[SPEAKER_05]: An hour run with barb will fill the entire
ziplock bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a half pound bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: No joke.
Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: A half pound bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: What comes off?
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an hour run it's still like 50% heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which to people that aren't hash makers
that might not sound like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even by itself would be that much
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean without extracting it from the
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the bud itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something about smoking the bud
that's not as.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor in the bud for some reason
doesn't fully carry over to the taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with the new Tangy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you smell it it's like oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it carries over in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the barb it doesn't so much in
the bud but the resin is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's me and I'm just around so much
other flavorful bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: No the bottom line is I make a lot of
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like skunk man Sam skunk number one
produces resin like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so did the strain that they crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did they cross to produce the sleet
stack?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that sleet stack skunk cross was the
one that also just produced an enormous
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one day we'll be focused on that when
we all have greenhouses going and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to grow way larger amounts and it's
just like oh I got a 55 gallon drum just
[SPEAKER_02]: full of material I have to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really I have 10 of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Running in the HPLC right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what it tests at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't even be in HPLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen that little device that you
can just like if they're making it for
[SPEAKER_02]: fruits and vegetables it's like the same
idea as a spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they needed to take a spectrometer
which is like a large tabletop machine and
[SPEAKER_02]: they turned it into this tiny little chip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it took them three years to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fits in this little hand thing and
it's basically like a molecular sniffer or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you pointed a fruit and it'll
tell you if there's pesticides used.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just reading online the O-Phone
where they can send, right now they're
[SPEAKER_05]: like 30 programmed scents but you can mix
them together to make over 300,000
[SPEAKER_05]: different smells and you can send it to
your friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a picture along with a smell to your
friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the technology is out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sitting on the ferry and I was like
man the smoker kids of tomorrow are going
[SPEAKER_05]: to have the whole colour spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you tried this variety?
[SPEAKER_05]: And potentially spectrums outside of that
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go looking for it and they go
looking for those smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole you know when you turn the
flashlight on in the dark room it's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing how easier you can move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the metaphor as you get in deeper
and you understand what you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you see all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say you're really
taking it to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like even this gear you know like
I've always been enjoying Kai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but now the dabs and the butter and
the shatter and all the hardware and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools and all the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The six-year-old master crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call the technological side?
[SPEAKER_01]: Innovation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must say that you've really refined
the high by zeroing in on that trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah and the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cleaning of it and getting it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because on the island for ten years we've
been sort of dry sifting on the island for
[SPEAKER_05]: a long long long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us it was always just trimming the
bugs on the screen and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sort of collecting this and collecting
this quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've always ever just had like little
balls of it and little containers of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last cup for me you know sort of
opened it up to cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cleaning it and getting rid of the
contaminant that's in there right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really the difference between.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the high is exponential.
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 and 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you get up to those crazy levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from 95 to 98 that 3% is like telling
you it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the first time I ever went
to Skunk Man's place and he puffed me down
[SPEAKER_02]: with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob Clark would always tell stories of
like oh man I left his place like
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-eyed the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I like sat there one night
and puffed I left so destroyed I was
[SPEAKER_02]: literally just like okay I understand now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 99%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 99%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because he's in control of like
growing that resin and cleaning it and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where it really starts and
that's what that's what I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I love cleaning resin and playing
with resin and running different people's
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff through my bags and screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also love growing resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man it puts a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I've got some Docatomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Docatomic brought me some NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah some beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude of course it's yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Harmony which is from Hyperman.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that on the island.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I photographed it recently at that
licensed production facility that I went
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tilray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they had Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a whole bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice to see nice bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not allowed to talk about the facility but
can definitely say the bud was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't smoke the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't smoke bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photographed the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photographed lots of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say it was like just kind of
right up there with most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the real sort of test would be
to isolate the resin and then be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I could literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a cool thing for a bubble
man to be able to offer to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even a crew of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we're like well we're well known
people in the cannabis industry and what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're offering is we'll come in,
we'll extract your resins, we'll smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll give you a review on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can keep it private if you want or
you can use it as you know your.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah you know like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like here's the thing
everyone's bashing these LPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like okay fine if they're selling
moldy weed or they're not growing good
[SPEAKER_02]: herb or they're selling strains that
aren't the real strains then fine then
[SPEAKER_02]: that they deserve to have people on that
because it's important that they don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there are ones that are just
literally good people they're like well
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just growing herb to sell it to
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like an old business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just like to know which ones have
good herb because I haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get behind and you know unfortunately for
us to order herb as licensed users here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada we lose our ability to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put that in some amendments so
it's why I didn't I was going to order
[SPEAKER_02]: herb from all of the licensed production
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do that either but I thought I'd
do it with a bunch of my friends if we
[SPEAKER_02]: each picked one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well you could make you can get your
doctor to say sign five different forms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And say you have 20 grams and you can just
say I'm getting four grams four grams from
[SPEAKER_05]: five different guys and then therefore you
can't you can't get that many.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's a hassle to the doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still I wanted to do a review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get like a half pound from
each one and then run it through my
[SPEAKER_02]: screens photograph the resin show the
resin whether it melts or bubbles and
[SPEAKER_02]: literally have it in a room full of people
where we all do a little mini cup and just
[SPEAKER_02]: say you know like listen I've been all
over the world and smoked all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: world that's good resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one I didn't like that much but I
just you know it'd be a nice honest
[SPEAKER_02]: review.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of these LPs can really
use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think if you're out there and
you're in an LP and you want some
[SPEAKER_05]: professional advice from people that have
been in the industry for 25 35.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably close to 80 years in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is right there and it's like you
know and we're not the only ones by any
[SPEAKER_02]: means you know guys like Ramo and get you
know there's a lot of different people out
[SPEAKER_02]: there not just even in British Columbia
all across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can sort of I think suit that you
know that need where it's like you have
[SPEAKER_02]: respected individuals who you know people
are following them on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter social media all the social media
outlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge you know it's how I give
it's how I stand behind both of you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: like I have to say just because you're my
friends and I wouldn't be like all like
[SPEAKER_02]: promoting you guys if you just didn't have
things that inspired me I would have a
[SPEAKER_02]: hard time doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean like.
[SPEAKER_01]: No hard time being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that you guys both grew the dank
and both breed the dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important and and I love the fact
that you guys both sell your seeds at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in-house we're always shouting them
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca's golden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah she just got back from Jamaica
herself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple Tangy Fino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah there you go.
Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy Fino.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's won a lot of awards.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as I smoked this it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys smoke that joint because there's
never been a joint smoked in my office and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love it to be smoked by these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna smoke some down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a fan that once that joint gets
puffed up and we're not filming anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably heard me turn the fan off at
the halfway point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school, new school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow that Astro Boy tasted really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Margaret needs some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay well then I'm gonna get you guys some
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doc's out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doc's out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright he's out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hanging out for a bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny's here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chill for a short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright we'll do a short Puff Wednesday
sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the dirty resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well two have left and one has arrived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get you puffing right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the nice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some of that dry sift barb that I
pressed up quite some time ago to I think
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed it in a video.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whiting out of the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you a little dunker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dunk it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll probably float right over the hole
there but should be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made a little hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe lost a tiny bit in the center but
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just missed Doc while you saw him
in the driveway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a video with him next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, Doc brought me the Harmony from
Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is really bringing us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought us the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to test that Harmony against
the MKUltro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I think I have something that has
some Northern Light in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well this is the old Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think you were going to pull it
right out of your back pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was not joking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has got some Northern Light in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: The My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Bubba Ken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a pre-98 Bubba Kush with a Ken
for reunion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross into a Northern Light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked to Doc about that at the
bottom of the stairs when he came up and
[SPEAKER_03]: he smiled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said 92 and he's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which number is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is number 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fino 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fino 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Fino 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have one of those right now in
bloom down in my tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get that happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bloom that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll definitely do a little shoot on my
channel probably in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: days of where the My Little Pony is number
1 and number 4.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like week 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B ordered a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same camera I'm using which is the
X920 Panasonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a prosumer model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Costs about $800-$900 if you want to check
it out on BNHphoto.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Johnny got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got the nice wide angle lens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The macro lens which maybe we'll play with
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't I let you talk about what
else you brought while I go grab your box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I need to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The box showed up the other day and you
know what I was going to wait until Puff
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday to open it and at the same time
there's the Medi Kush guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man now that's something I can get
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay I'm going to go grab your box.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell us about the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I brought Mark another Medi.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did the last round of it and he was
talking about how great the resin was and
[SPEAKER_03]: how much he really appreciated and he said
it's definitely his medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took some great shots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some macros which you know he's well like
he's understanding how good Medi Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: works for me and a lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10 beautiful clones from that such a
[SPEAKER_03]: small plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my thinning of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not thinning I peel the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently thinning is something
completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do my peel.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have seen it in some of my previous
videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's being peeled so it's splitting my
top right there already.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just forcing these bottom really
nicely here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely get a great little bush
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Special delivery!
[SPEAKER_02]: I got something for you Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to stand up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put a more comfortable chair in just
because well I like to be more
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You alright?
[SPEAKER_03]: You still talking about Medi?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about Medi and I was talking
about how I could show them how many
[SPEAKER_03]: different clones and how I was doing my
peel and how I forced this down as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see so this will really pull it out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's opening up my box.
[SPEAKER_02]: No no I'm just actually opening the
plastic for you to cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got your tool there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't buy myself pretty much anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's no man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: No I've had this box for days and no plans
on opening it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even someone was like oh you should open
it up and charge it for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like no no.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be opening it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
That's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your card.
[SPEAKER_03]: First we have the mega card so we can do
lots of videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: SD card 64 gig.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we're definitely going to be
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we pull out the macro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ultra macro conversion one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost it in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well now we have one that we can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the wide angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the wide angle that we are now
looking at through right now so I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your Watson dual charger which I
have mine literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: My new Panasonic digital camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dude yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I can do some more videos on how I
do my medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do some videos now even how I
decarboxylate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about the different
people who different decarboxylations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get some great education
from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically ordered everything for John.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like just get me what I need and
then I was like okay I'll tell you this is
[SPEAKER_02]: the dream package right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I made one fail at not getting
him a tripod and I'm hoping he himself
[SPEAKER_02]: goes and gets one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been telling him this for about a
week now since we ordered this camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get a tripod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get a tripod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even today we probably would have filmed
with that camera had he gotten a tripod
[SPEAKER_02]: because you need a tripod.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well where do you put the camera?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well see I have a few tripods at home but
I realized I'm going to need to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: better one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious on a couple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at how yours was and how it
slid back and forth and I was reading on
[SPEAKER_03]: the site there where they had that one
that motions with you so if you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a $500 tripod.
[SPEAKER_02]: $275.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you look next to it the other
component that you need to make that work
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would wear on your belt is like
another $200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh so we're definitely not getting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally am looking for about a $40 to
$50 tripod.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I have is a nice I have nice big
Manfrotto legs with the professional video
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fairly expensive tripod at maybe
$300 plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for something extremely light
because of course it can't carry too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I don't like that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it so I'm definitely not getting
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate carrying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a lighter one to carry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hitting a swap meet this weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: That camera that I want to give it to
Mikey is loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his little bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've seen a couple pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh he's snapping pictures like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to document so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came from the cool kid in Toronto
at Champs who gifted me the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I have now been gifted a new camera
so I passed yours on with the help of John
[SPEAKER_02]: to his neighbour Mike and you can watch
them on their videos and I'm sure you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get turned on to Mike through his social
media and start checking out some of his
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures that he's snapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: My garden on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where you get all of Mike's
pictures and he's going to do videos on
[SPEAKER_03]: how to cook your own food and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all about educating and it's really
cool so we're actually affecting more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more people around us and even you're
going to get a camera out there and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do some videos and help educate
other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best thing about YouTube is we're
educating everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you see your dry sift here that you
brought by?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow yeah no this was um let me tell you a
little bit more about this guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually a hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're looking at was the CBD and I
was curious of what is being sold in town
[SPEAKER_03]: in clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell CBD caps and they're three to
five dollars and we were curious what was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a good look and what we're
realizing is well how much of that is
[SPEAKER_03]: really completely like absolutely nothing
in there would you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say maybe about 85 to 95 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: 85 to 95 percent of that is pure waste so
I'm really seeing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't even seem like a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like carpet or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what we're taking a better
look at what's going on with what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening with the new industries and
everybody's getting into these CBD caps
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's out there hearing it all over
the place but you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what people are putting in those
caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what people are putting in these
caps.
Be wary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be very wary if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't grow your own hemp that's the
only problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't need to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: No you just grow cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're needing caps and if you're
needing a CBD product then grow a CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: known strain and it doesn't matter if
there's THC in it just don't decarboxylate
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC or the CBD will still be active.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll still be able to acquire it through
your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't need to activate the THC and
so there's no worries of needing a hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: product that's grown for food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't grown for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or grown for other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were just curious and got my hands
on a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I had no idea that I cleaned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent like an hour and a half cleaning
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to clean hemp and no one's ever
going to use it for medicine but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time well spent for the experiment we'll
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well we've taken a look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see what's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you got all the macro photos and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I still actually have yet to shoot
each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The video is waiting to upload so yeah
you'll have seen this video that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about prior to the video we're
filming right now because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: edit it and upload it first.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one will go up afterwards and you'll
have seen all the macro photos of this
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a little bit of education out
there of what people are being.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this big craze and you know me and
Mark talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's like CBD CBD CBD so this is of
course another way of people extracting
[SPEAKER_03]: money from the sick and disabled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude I'm excited to grow some Medi Kush
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Medi Hayes growing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got three of them blooming along with
the OG I think it's a Haas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Haas number nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some Astro Boys and I have two My
Little Ponies that are quite big and
[SPEAKER_02]: stretched out really stretched out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very very excited on the sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you don't have sweet scones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have the couple that rooted the
Sour D.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that didn't root for me was the
Cone Root.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right yeah exactly which I told you I
could give you a new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so of course right now I'm just kind
of going away so I've got I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you'll see in my videos basically my
whole room is down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well my room is just about to get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited to actually get
everything going today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope John is going to tell me that he
brought the new tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new tent in my truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something new today too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have for you there's a power corner
in there above a tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have this new cloner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I set the power cloner up on a
table in the corner there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome so you got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Picked up some hard pots of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you like those hard pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the well we have the tent the DR.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nano Lux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh of course you have the Nano Lux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nano Lux ballast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only got one ballast this time because
the Lush people have sent me an LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Kingston Erb for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook up and I'm going to put the LED for
half of this tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The LED 2XL dominator is going to be in
there and on the other side will be the
[SPEAKER_02]: simple high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens between the two
that are on either side and then we'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have like you know Congo sweet
skunk, Congo sweet skunk and then in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle Congo sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have one far spectrum of one or the
other but then in the middle at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time you get the combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be something that I'm going to
be doing full video full macro photography
[SPEAKER_02]: documentation of so stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you say we get your camera
plugged in and sorted out so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: started and then we go film the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey we've got more stuff to do so you know
what let's just switch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: you you
