[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it snowed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little bit crazy, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that blue out of... Oh, it's
constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's constant this whole winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, are we kind of even,
or are we off?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure we're even.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want in a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always looking to see if we have the
same amount of space on either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an epic view behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, welcome everybody to Bubble
Man's world, and of course, welcome to
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B is in the house for this Puff
Wednesday, and I'm pretty excited to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that after so many years of people
bringing me dry sift to clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you brought me something that was
worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, so shout out to your buddy who
produced this lovely trikes and grew and
[SPEAKER_01]: listened to you putting screens under his
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some beautiful dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it was originally... This was
originally what I got to work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll show you that in a better angle
as well, as well as photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: John had cleaned up a little bit of it
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a nice little chunk here,
and then I basically went forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaned the sort of low quality,
the seconds that he was left with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I did this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this particular Puff Wednesday
is going to entail, I suspect,
[SPEAKER_01]: is us talking about this dry sift,
and of course, us enjoying this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, there's a little ball in there
because you just touched it with your
[SPEAKER_01]: finger, and it just went right... It was
amazing how fast this product melted in
[SPEAKER_01]: your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just touched it, and it was literally
clear, almost opaque, amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about this is just this
part of this is how fresh this resin truly
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, we went from... I've convinced
a few people to start trimming with
[SPEAKER_02]: screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trim over the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take a look at what you're losing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he calls me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, dude, you gotta come check this
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the beginning stages, he took the 60,
the 90, the 120, and the 200, and just
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmed over top of them and put it all
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I came back and he had it all on
these screens, and I did a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning, and I did original cleaning that
you taught me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is using the 60, the 90,
the 110, and then cleaning on the 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I pulled this off the 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it showed him a little epicness,
and I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: To really show him the true magic would be
to come and see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that alone would just happen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sticking the dabber on here and getting
it hot and then putting it into the sift
[SPEAKER_02]: as it melts around it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would give me a little dab,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a little dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very light and fluffy, so it won't be
an oversized dab, but I figured while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're chatting away over there about the
beautifulness of this, I just gotta puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gotta puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really, really enjoy about this,
guys, is of course this is organically
[SPEAKER_02]: grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is grown with 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's my one part grown bloom that I
really, really get behind, and stand
[SPEAKER_02]: behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really shows, and Mark will contest
to that, whenever I bring resin that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: grown with a certain nutrient,
what I do, we get these awesome glows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it really do is just maturity,
taking it to day 63, day 65, finding out
[SPEAKER_02]: when it stops drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these little tricks and tricks that
ensure that I've learned just from talking
[SPEAKER_02]: with you over the last four years of how
to make sure that I have developed
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: As he's doing that, and he's looking for
the cap, if you don't think I'm jumping in
[SPEAKER_02]: here right now and doing my own little
dab, yeah, it's like on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a beautiful thing right here,
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to leave you hanging, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, because I left the Q-tips sitting
right over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the recycling bin, so I couldn't see
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I saw them with the
sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was looking for a carb cap,
and then I started using the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, he's looking for a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, he didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Q-tippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember to always clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've learned now, I've been
cleaning my thing, and I actually managed
[SPEAKER_02]: to pick up some of the goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when I went and saw a friend,
and he had a jar of it, a bottle of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, can I have some of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get you a nice big rip on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, I just tried doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, I'm learning it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're holding on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's getting a little bubble going on
there, and that bubble is actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like the end of the dabber's got a
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get you proper styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You deserve, oh man, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do macro video for you to see
the melt factor on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny little bit of char left over on the
sapphire nail at the end of the hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but very little compared to the quality of
the actual resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always that you get resin of this
quality, you know, and it's why a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have a hard time making that
six-star bubble hash or making that
[SPEAKER_01]: six-star 99.9% gland head ratio dry sift,
because having the material first and
[SPEAKER_01]: foremost is what's going to move you into
the next stage of actually being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: game and now being in a position where you
could unveil the quality of that resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three different piles?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got three different piles of epicness
and then two piles of get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's one was that,
well, it is nice to have you come over and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, I got some resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you clean it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did that there last time we got
to see the difference and there was hardly
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was last resin that you brought me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I went to clean it and there
was literally like nothing, like not even
[SPEAKER_01]: a dab worth of a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of interesting because I
thought it was really, really good sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny when people think something
and then you show them otherwise and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're kind of like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas today, you know, when you brought
this, I knew the second I saw that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be fire, but you were like,
no, no, clean this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the shittier version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's, now it's what I clean is much
nicer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at that color right there,
this is the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can start seeing that color
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to turn this into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this pile here is going to be big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be probably like,
it'd be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should weigh that to find out what
percentage of heads we get out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I bet it's 50 to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will weigh it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will be detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a photo essay at the end of this
video, we'll be able to show you the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of what we started with,
the weights of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll kind of make this a fun,
interesting video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets to show you what you can get and
what the screens that I get from you and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they can possibly work, what I'm able
to accomplish with just screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, dude, like I said, you did a great
job on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely looks fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was showing my bunny and you know
what I used the best part about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I used to clean this was a Tim
Horton's donut box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was showing him, I was going over
and I said, you got to cut it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: was pulling out what you have in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pulling out all the leaf matter that
they mix into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's got a different way of
trying to do their sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you showed me, I've, you know,
came up with little ways of making sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: pull the contaminants out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it easier for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how easy it was to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to get from here to this stage with
the static and using the DVD and the
[SPEAKER_02]: parchment would probably take me about a
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd take a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I can come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, 15 minutes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it took 15?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to catch an ant with your
son.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that's what, I mean, I didn't
know cause I was, you know, we were
[SPEAKER_02]: catching an ant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality time with the tea man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was explaining to him how he went into
the hole and he was going to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought he never come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bugger did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up to be at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got dabbed out with a wet napkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of this hot dabber
technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was cool because you had a
bubble come on there and then he dipped
[SPEAKER_02]: into it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the bubble and it's like,
boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really hard to pick up this sift
because it's just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, all I can do is really melt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when it first snows out and it's
really, really nice and it's powder and
[SPEAKER_02]: you look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fluffy powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fluffy powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it settles and as it day
progresses, it settles and gets harder and
[SPEAKER_02]: harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's exactly what's happened here
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in about an hour it's going to be
stuck to that curb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's to you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it seems like just yesterday I
was watching the RCMP rifle through your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, put you under arrest and threaten
you with a jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't it seem like just like yesterday?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coincidentally enough, one year to the day
where they announced that we won the
[SPEAKER_01]: injunction, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or my picture with the neck brace on,
on the paw leaf was on the front page of
[SPEAKER_02]: the golden mill all across Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the same day, a year later,
I got pulled over and was questioned if I
[SPEAKER_02]: had been smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any cannabis in your car?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, if I were you,
I would have said, you know, funny enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, which is extremely, extremely
rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly can't believe you didn't have
cannabis in your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you not have cannabis in your car?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one Medtano XL with one bud with a
boba pack in the console.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I'd had nothing on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also a brand new car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three weeks old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you take it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best part about it is I love this part
because you guys didn't see this part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at first he comes up, he comes to the
passenger side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people think I'm in the passenger side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the driver's side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way the camera was set up on the
dash and he thought it was part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mirrored.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at that and he comes to the
passenger side and my girl rolls down the
[SPEAKER_02]: window and he looks in and he goes,
um, you know, you blew a red light back
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, it was green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, Oh, it smells like cannabis in the
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have any cannabis in your car?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and at first I said, no,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be some in this Medtano and
handed it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go this smell proof grinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He opens it like this smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, Whoa, pulls back and hands it
back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then asked me and I said, well,
I'm a patient to get my mirror.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I go since 2012, this is when,
uh, you know, uh, we started the
[SPEAKER_02]: injunction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm protected on the injunction while
I'm up until I can verify with health
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, you're under arrest for cannabis
possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, pardon me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, well, you're under arrest for
cannabis possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand him my driver's license.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I'm not going to charge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to charge you for running a
red light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so as the day, as this progressing
went to his car, I'm watching in my rear
[SPEAKER_02]: view mirror as another cop pulls up and he
started adjusting his camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's, here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Albertsford, which is a private
police force, but I was pulled over by
[SPEAKER_02]: RCMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the, at the exact time that the federal
top cop that was put in charge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis fucking, what, what do they call
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Blair was actually in Albertsford
that day doing a talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know that, which is
guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why those RCMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had RCMP there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pull me over and then when I see them
going through the camera, I go,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, when I saw it first, I was in
disbelief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, is this from like six months
ago or six months ago it happened again
[SPEAKER_02]: for this same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something I'm witnessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get pulled up behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm driving a brand new car.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a company car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's registered under the company feeling
like they're watching you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do I guess you do put videos up
on YouTube for people to watch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, but I mean, I'm doing,
but not to be, but not to be harassed by
[SPEAKER_01]: cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just tell them, listen,
man, I got a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see what I'm all about,
you can watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I update it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm on Facebook live right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you add me on Facebook live,
you can watch you doing what you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm looking in my rear view,
I see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit Facebook live because I think,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a good move that you did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought it would get like 25,000
plus hits in a period of like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like 800 people watching live.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were telling me that because I was
going to the mom cup, the mail order
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana cup, and everybody was waiting
for me to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of people shared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hundreds of people shared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone shared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody shared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you get those views up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to share those videos,
you know, and unfortunately, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be great if people shared more
than just our dramas and the bad shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understand this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to a lawyer about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got pulled over in a company car,
what was registered under my company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and the first thing he asked me is it
smells like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now speed back six months prior to that,
I got pulled over in my truck with my dad
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled up the window and goes,
it smells like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both times there's no marijuana in my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time there wasn't a med team and the
last time I was with my father,
[SPEAKER_02]: there wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sweat marijuana though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do sweat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does come through my glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, as being a medical
patient and the advocacy that I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: am I, is it on my record?
[SPEAKER_02]: When my come up and they go, Oh,
check for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause now this is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what, that's what you get for being
a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cannabis activist because,
because, because I'm a medical patient and
[SPEAKER_02]: I use cannabis for my pain, which you get
John, I got, I got, I got two hours of my
[SPEAKER_02]: time taken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat in that and, and this is the other
one I said, so when I sat in the back of
[SPEAKER_02]: the car, that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I sat in the back of his,
in his Tahoe and this Tahoe has got a
[SPEAKER_02]: police dog in it and it's barking like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I'm sitting in there,
I can see he's been computer screen,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's duty trunk rolls, Dr. Marijuana
girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I would pull over with marijuana,
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this whole screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this traffic, this traffic officer was
not a traffic officer at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was RCMP drug squad because Bill Blair
was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on a back road, driving down the
road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled up beside him and knew he was
beside me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't click.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was RCMP until after the fact that done
the video and left and what, why was RCMP
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're feds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're feds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go anywhere they go anywhere they
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt the RCMP even have traffic cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're all federal agents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually almost say, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you got something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the federal task force.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have any time you get busted for
any sort of like illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the RCMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I ended up getting busted in
West Vancouver years ago, it was RCMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: RCMP ended up coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got charged federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a provincial crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of confusing and weird,
but, uh, well, the bottom line is I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry that you got harassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do hope that you'll enjoy that big
old fucking dry sift that I just hooked
[SPEAKER_01]: you up with.
You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nice to be able to sit here and do
this now, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got a nice couple of carb caps if
the one gets too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice melt on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a five star for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe closing in a little bit of char at
the end, but it's still pretty damn clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's, I'd say it's a solid 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tiny little bit of contaminant
in there that probably makes up the one to
[SPEAKER_01]: two percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I did do a very quick, quick cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe when I have more time, when I clean
this one, I'll take it to that next level
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's for Johnny and Maya's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically head stashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me, you and my buddy who grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the other people we puff it with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about it is,
is he's the guy who's going to puff it
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and being able to, being able to
actually finally show him what he's been
[SPEAKER_02]: losing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The look on his face, dude was like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be doing this for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I know you throwing away
totes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, wheelbarrow, 20 pounds of heads,
wheelbarrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you growers are throwing in
the garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a set of screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what some of you growers are
throwing in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I doubt not a lot of people have
that same sort of mentality of the old
[SPEAKER_01]: school sort of just, you know,
I called it hilly built hillbilly growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't say it as like a, like a
negative cause I'm a hillbilly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that country hillbilly action,
but the growing way of that sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: real loose and real sort of just like,
we'll just get her done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always going to produce this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, dealing with commercial growers,
there's a small percentage of them that
[SPEAKER_01]: can even do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hung dry this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that I talk about is what he
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was just the way he cared it,
the way he grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genetics, just the genetics,
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no unveiling of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if they don't put it there in the
first place, you know, I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, a lot of people have brought me sift
in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first time in a long time
that I've been like, I'm like right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I saw the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to clean this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you came up like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where last time the good one was,
it wasn't even a pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like inconsequential.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really, really surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, the last one was
commercially grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less dried on screens and not hung
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should show them a nice macro hit on
the Sapphire of this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think it won't be this hit
because I'm going to be cleaning up the
[SPEAKER_01]: dish like really clean, but we'll cut as
I'm about to take this rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be seeing this melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to like talk about it,
Johnny B, the melt content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best part about how this melts
is how it puddles right away and it swirls
[SPEAKER_02]: around the bowl and goes into a really
nice liquid and you can see a bubbling and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can almost see it dissipate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not getting the great big huge
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of just kind of goes like water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of that, that is my
favorite coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get it in all the videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first video we did, we're cleaning dry
sift in 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift clean in 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we used to rip it so hard,
it was like we were trying to get like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pulled muscle.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true, true that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's come a long way and
learning exactly the proper ways of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I say there's no proper way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that you like, the way that you,
the proper ways, the proper ways,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's times and temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, I used to like a higher heat,
but now that I'm not in such that harsh
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic pain anymore, my pain's different
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower heat seems good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen me hitting anything now
at 710 to 740 anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause cause I felt like that, that higher
hit hit me harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more terpenes and I can see how
the terpenes are being able to modulate
[SPEAKER_02]: and help me better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like the sift so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it gives me all those flavors
that I don't get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful macro photos of this stuff as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see glistening gland heads mixed
in with the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny, tiny, tiny little bits of plant
matter in there with a little bit of maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: capitate stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid 98% hash with, you know,
done in about, I mean, realistically done
[SPEAKER_01]: in about four or five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll end it with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer Puff Wednesday Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and short, but sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at how sweet that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to continue doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll sit and we'll puff for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll clean this up so we get the bowl nice
and white and we'll film a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: macro rip of some dry sift hitting the
dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we're not going to carb cap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is going to be a little bit of a
waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's going to get that sort of,
uh, you know, carbless rip, but we do it
[SPEAKER_01]: for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you all enjoyed this little
episode of Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might throw a little drone footage in
there, but, uh, we'll see you next
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend, hopefully for Hash Church and
hopefully next Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the weed that keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the weed that sue the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the weed gave by this
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the weed let I view the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja is not here to trick the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only here to do its purpose of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have been traveling to Kingston,
both 20 miles and hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be flipping on the job, won't fart
like the clock doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh vegetation, weed trees and weed
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can step on, kick the gun.
Thank you.
