[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a bit since I actually mentioned
anything about my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just in the middle of chopping down a
little Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Astro Boy here, to give you an idea
of the quality of this nugget,
[SPEAKER_01]: is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very nice nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been growing for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice smelling, as Astro Boy always
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my screen out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one nugget already here trimmed
lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also trimmed about a plant's worth
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got another plant and a bit right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just sort of wanted to go over the
quickness of how I prepare my plants for
[SPEAKER_02]: washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, usually I cut them down fresh,
do a fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: These have actually been hanging for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do notice already just a little bit
of a difference, even in how the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: feels to touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically just do a quick snippety
snip and remove fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're washing the resin
off of the plant, you want the resin to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to cut it off like the way
you would, you know, if you were smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: just the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to remove all that plant matter
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just take it a step further and I say
leave all the plant matter so you can take
[SPEAKER_02]: it all off with the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
and a boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about three more booms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just getting them right down to nice
manageable size buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will make for an easier extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I also saved the stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stalk is completely sticky and covered
in lemony, limonene type smelling
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those terpenes are inside glandular
trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would we get rid of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll actually do, this is of course not
going to be a first run by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in here will be just bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a small pile of just the
small trim leaf, but I don't get very much
[SPEAKER_02]: of it because mostly I leave it all on for
the bud run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, I think I had three, four plants of
the Astro Boy total this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Downstairs in the tent I still have Medi
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Little Pony, an Afghani, and I believe
a Hoss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoss number 10 from Mr. Berfello.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of, I should probably leave those
Medi Kushes or Medi Hazes and the My
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Ponies.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it is getting to a point where I
have to go away again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have nine to 10 plants already
prepped and ready for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the, for the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those is actually, a couple of
them actually are the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm fairly interested in getting those
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I may very well chop the Medi Haze and
the My Little Pony, even though it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's probably potentially about a
week to two weeks, what you would consider
[SPEAKER_02]: early for that particular strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only have a few plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be running them for hash
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I've mentioned before that,
you know, sometimes you can affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: profile by cutting it early or late,
and it's not necessarily a negative
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you want to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be one of those times
that I believe I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll keep you guys informed as to what
goes on with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'll also keep you guys informed
with what goes in exactly to the tent,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I had it written down somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see my book anywhere, but I had it
written down all the different strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have ready right now, and there's
about nine or ten of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if there's an East Coast
Sour Diesel in there, a Congolese,
[SPEAKER_02]: and some Jamaicans, and maybe even a
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a nice selection nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not everything I have, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just nine plants ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll keep you informed of that as it
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, this plant was flushed for
four, geez, about five, five of the nine
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks that it was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just decided, pretty much less than a
month in even, to just start watering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant never really turned yellow,
so it's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Medi One OG flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple, very simple, simple feeding
product, one part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very low in pH, so when you dump it
into an eight or a seven pH water,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking down at three to 3.5,
so a little bit of pH to bring it back up
[SPEAKER_02]: to that 6.2 to 6.8 perfect sort of
cannabis-friendly pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how this was grown,
basically, in that tent under two 600-watt
[SPEAKER_02]: light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nano Lux were the ballasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret Jardin were the tents, so I'm
really quite happy with how it all turned
[SPEAKER_02]: out, especially for a summer crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer's always harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you guys know, the bugs like to move in
in summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get heat issues, you can get
mildews, you can get all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from the smallest, smallest amount,
I saw a little bit of white flies just on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom, and I just, just had the hint
of a mite or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really glad that I safer soaked
these before I put them into flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that summertime these bugs just
come out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to cleaning the tent
right out once I cut those many hazes and
[SPEAKER_02]: my little ponies down, as well as the Haas
and the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghani looks so good, and I'm telling
you, it smells almost identical to old
[SPEAKER_02]: school Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan from Romulan Joe, back in the days
of the Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I hear so many people talk about
that strain, and I don't remember any of
[SPEAKER_02]: them being around back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get the herb from Joe himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would trade him my own Dutch treat that
I was growing for the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would trade him an ounce or two ounces
for an ounce or two ounces of his herb,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I remember that Romulan very,
very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking for it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am really, really under the belief now,
after getting the Afghani from the Great
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardener, that the Romulan, if it wasn't
that Afghani, it was definitely an
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: That piney, incredibly piney taste that
the Romulan was so well known for really
[SPEAKER_02]: shines through in Matt's Afghani cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask him and find out more
about the lineage of that Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: where he acquired it, and to follow it
back as far as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from Afghanistan, but it's always
nice to know the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who got it?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did they go there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did they collect it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The more we can know about this stuff,
to me, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to continue on here,
cutting this bud up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share a little bit of it with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to get some macro shots of the
living resin on some of these buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some in the fridge already that
I'm freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we'll see a little batch of
fresh frozen come our way sooner than
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do leave for Jamaica in a couple of days
here, going back to work on the project
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I'll get a batch off before
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to show you that I'm done
chopping up those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two large bags of bud,
maybe 100, 150 grams of dry product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got myself all the stalks that I
chopped and all the bandages in these two
[SPEAKER_02]: bags here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four half-pound bags, pretty stuffed to
the bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The brim, I'll be able to fresh frozen the
buds, wash them, do a couple of runs,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a good chunk of bubble, like a 10% to
12% return.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll be able to take that material
and I'll pre-soak that in a coconut oil
[SPEAKER_02]: extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it's a lower quality,
I can still offer it to friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: to myself, when I don't want to eat a more
powerful or maybe if I just want to use it
[SPEAKER_02]: as a self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then these two as well, the stalks and the
fan leaves and the small trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be turning that into a coconut oil
extraction as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this one little bud now I'm going
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take macro photographs of it
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to leave you guys with a little
macro slideshow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to wound every season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do your research and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to wound every season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs.
I use the herbs for more than one reason.
I use the herbs to wound every season.
I use the herbs for more than one reason.
