[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World and Puff
Wednesday with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back home, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys saw a few of the videos
that I posted and some of the photos that
[SPEAKER_00]: John and I were posting, as well as Tony
and some other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it was an amazing trip to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very interesting trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great people.
Good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fried fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today's Puff Wednesday,
while we yammer on about all the things we
[SPEAKER_00]: yammer on about, I won't delay in smoking
a pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's been waiting to try one for... Two
weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the quality of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: No paper, no glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing it to you and explaining it to
you so you don't have to ask in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pure hash pressed out laminated into
a thin flat strip and then rolled over a
[SPEAKER_00]: toothpick or another small straight
object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that pulled frozen and it sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty much looking forward to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you light that bad boy up?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a little bit of etiquette with a
pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to be gentle when you put
it in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to squeeze it with your
fingers and close the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just lightly, you know,
cherry out the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually put my teeth in front of the
hole because it can pull a little hot the
[SPEAKER_00]: first few times until it resins up and it
closes up a little bit in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while John's doing that, I want to
thank Dynasty Genetics for a multitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they sent us some beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent us some shirts that we're both
wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing right now and I've really been
impressed with his photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the MPE lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what body he's shooting on,
but he's taking some really great photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumbs up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely digging the macro shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to see macro shots, whether they're
mine or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love to see quality macro cannabis
shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm being a little quiet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that you'd be quiet with this
hash joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I also want to thank Method 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be putting my Method 7 shades on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my Sun Resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently sent me a real nice little
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of photography under the HPS
and metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sent me a set of the Resistance
HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are basically, they turn under
the HPS light to look normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll imprint a photo over the video so you
understand what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a set of the metal halide
operators, which are under that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get quite as bad of a headache,
but these just filter out the light that's
[SPEAKER_00]: bad for your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like their company logo here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Method 7, don't grow blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a couple of meanings,
but I thought that was pretty sharp of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also sent me the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a green lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I look under my LED light,
it looks just perfectly normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool what this company's done
and how they've created these simple
[SPEAKER_00]: lenses for your eyes to produce that
normal light that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they do the camera filters
now as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a pair right in the very beginning
for protecting my eyes, being in a room
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they work great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say some of my beginning photos on
Instagram were taken with Method 7
[SPEAKER_01]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, just taking it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing some filming and stuff like
that when we first had some, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Planet Nutrients picked them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I picked them up from in
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Green Planet Nutrients is the
company that Method 7 asked me to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to as well, as they are a
British Columbian or Canadian distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are looking for the Method
7s and you're up in Canada, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the US, you can check out
Method7.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even here in Canada, you can check out
Method7.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they'll just direct you right to
the Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Planet Nutrients, Green Planet
Wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a t-shirt as well,
which I'll wear in the next video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, everyone, for these
wonderful gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Method 7 was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent it as a gift pack, you know,
welcomed me to the team and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't ask for a review, didn't ask for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, we know our product works
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it's another product that just
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll just be happy to see you using
it and talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about all I can do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving the way that has joined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just burning so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was saying, Method 7s,
had them some day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're definitely pretty pimped
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the UBC Chemo Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now rooted and growing in a two
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember when Remo gave this to
me, I posted a little picture of that
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little UBC Chemo Kush that
I'll be sharing probably first with
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny, as I generally share with him
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next to that, we've got the old
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you believe how tall this thing is,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to start topping this beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful ash on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing's about four feet tall now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that Jamaican hybrid that I've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The World Filo Taxi, which has three
three-leaf fan leaves coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has three.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has three.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle section basically is the two
sections with three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it splits up here and it normalizes
in these two stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and if we cut that top off,
then you're going to get great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I'll probably cut this top off
and clone every one of these growths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't be throwing away any of the
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then update on the Jamaican sprout
that I planted the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably has a half-inch long taproot
on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be planted pronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something else we should do here
on Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get that done today, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll do that in the next few
minutes once this hash joint's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll clip forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're halfway through this, so we don't
have like 10 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you we can puff it in five.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're puffing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really such a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys were inspired by the Pure
Hash Joint video, and John was real
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to get puffing on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great way to spend Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 30 degrees out, which is about 85
Fahrenheit for you Americans in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it when it came back and it was
like, it's so hot, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hotter in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it actually came back to
refreshing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was hotter in Jamaica because at
night it didn't cool off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stayed 31, 32 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're on top of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when you're in the hills,
it's like more like 15 to 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I've got all my moms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Congolese, Barb, Sweet Skunk,
East Coast Sour Diesel, Afghani,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this side, we have Mehdi Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the OG Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then you also have a Sweet
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Skunk with the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first clone to be taken, the first and
only clone that was taken and rooted so
[SPEAKER_00]: far is that plant right there off of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take five more Jamaicans the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, he's leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too hot for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell us to hang out with that
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, that was a really cool bug that
landed on my screen last night,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably from my metal halide light that
was glowing in the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it attracted this really cool beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool colors on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was white and striped and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't think my son will be
seeing him now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just flew off into the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, let's carry on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a sweet, sweet joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I got back and the first
thing I did was woke up and made some
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the fresh frozen that he made is
really sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to share some macro
photographs of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to talk about that right now,
what you did, and we'll share the video as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was that MKU.
[SPEAKER_01]: MKUltra that I grew in my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's on my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a few videos on it and I cut down
all of the bottoms and froze them and
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped on a plane, went to Jamaica,
came back and woke up the next day and
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbed the neighbor Mike and said,
we're making fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought over the half moon ice,
loaded up the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same run, 400 grams roughly wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, I did a video on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look forward to seeing that on my
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got some great, great yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to seeing the photos of the
hash that he made while he's talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice 40 day flush, many one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So had those for, well, I got those
basically from seed back in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to pinch that there, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be real careful towards the
last little part of passing these joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: They soften up and it's once you pinch it
like, like that, it slowly starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: disintegrate and fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have faith in John and I that we'll be
able, I'll know it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pinch, the pinch took it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hash is still here and we can pop
it in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that was a nice gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just puffed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually felt uplifted from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a nice, nice little buzz from
that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a solid buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the bubble AK 47 at 30% and 70%
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste the chocolate in there a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're going to go get that seed
and we're going to plant it in a puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pre-soaked a peak puck, got them in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got our little Jamaican seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in like 24 hours or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want to see this little guy
go in, I always use a paper towel,
[SPEAKER_00]: a wet piece of paper towel to do my
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do tweezers or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there she goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just kind of cover it with the
paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there she goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get that in the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we puffed a nice hash joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, we planted a new, a new Jamaican
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the nicest, was it not from the
nicest bud we saw while we were there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like by far?
[SPEAKER_00]: By far.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was by quite a distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few seeds that I gathered
while I was in the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were from fresh plants though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with that is you never
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how a fresh plant just looks
amazing even when it's fresh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it's going to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it dries, it's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this herb that I got this one
seed from was from beautiful dried cured
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a small bud, but man, it had a nice
blueberry fruity kind of skunkness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely gave me a little bit of a
bud there and I rolled it up and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, this is so tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably smoked the bud that I took
the seed out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I gave it to Tony if that was the
one that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we rolled and tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one that we just planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely was the tastiest bud we
tasted on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you posted and, uh,
yeah, keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for watching bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Okay.
Okay.
