[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm really excited to give the
Freedom Fighter of the Year Award because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I think this event is
ultimately about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we all share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we all understand freedom in a
way because we know what it feels like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have our freedom taken away sometimes,
needlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're here in Amsterdam, and we're
living in a world that's changing really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to change itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to have to take part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you love freedom, and you love
cannabis, and you're ready to dedicate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to cannabis freedom, let me hear
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I want everyone to just take a
moment and picture a world where every
[SPEAKER_00]: single person enjoys that freedom and that
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well then let's welcome a woman
who has dedicated her life to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom and the freedom of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a public defender, and as somebody who
helped run the campaign to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in the state of Washington and
send a message to the entire world that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're done with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to happen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we owe a big, big thanks to our
Freedom Fighter of the Year for running
[SPEAKER_00]: that campaign and inspiring the world
Alison Holcomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it everybody, our Freedom
Fighter of the Year, Alison Holcomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you, is anybody here from
the United States?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so today is Thanksgiving Day,
right, in the United States?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's entirely appropriate to be
receiving this honor on this day because I
[SPEAKER_02]: am so grateful that High Times Magazine,
that the Cannabis Pup, have been fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: the battle to keep this community
together, to keep this community safe,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to make this community free for
decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank High Times and
Cannabis Pup for doing that for us.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I went to work on the Initiative
502 campaign, before I went to work for
[SPEAKER_02]: the American Civil Liberties Union in
Washington State, I was a criminal defense
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many of our family members,
so many of our brothers and sisters,
[SPEAKER_02]: have suffered the battery ram at the door,
facing mandatory minimum sentences of five
[SPEAKER_02]: to ten years, literally watching their
children be put down on the floor with
[SPEAKER_02]: guns to their heads, all because they were
growing a plant, all because they were
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoying the freedom of enjoying that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why I decided to take on the
work that ultimately led to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just filled with joy to be able to
share it with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for supporting High Times
Magazine and Cannabis Pup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's do this worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alison Holcomb, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really got to let Alison hear it as she
leaves the stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it!
Let's hear it!
