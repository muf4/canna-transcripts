[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here for episode five of Cooking
with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we brought Ramo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ramo's in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got, we had a request for you.
Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we had a request for you,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, someone was like, man,
you guys gotta get Ramo on there,
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, all right, let's make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really good to see you, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been way too long, first of all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since COVID, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you since the train show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what just killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been no shows, there's been no
events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually see, not in our country,
but like in Spain or some foreign country,
[SPEAKER_02]: I hang out with Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you in Toronto at Lyft or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live far away from each other,
but I still, I've made the, I've made the
[SPEAKER_04]: trek out to your area a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really nice to hear that you
guys were going to be able to make the
trek.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out here to Merlin's place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got a really nice meal plan for
us here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a whole bunch of tacos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do what I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you need me to do, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm going to get Mrs. Gror to try
a thing because it's medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Living gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the living gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that from DNA or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this is from DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the doctor that you just quoted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just quoted the doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about that for a little bit
because when you said it, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: for just a split second, I was like,
how does he know about the living gold?
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I remembered we linked up in
Jamaica many years ago and we traveled up
[SPEAKER_04]: to my buddy's grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a hike.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a straight wall climb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, we were climbing a wall,
like it was a ladder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember when we got up there and he
had like 55 gallon buckets and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, how did you get this up
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, on my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: He climbed up this wall with these huge
things on his head.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what the other crazy thing about
this is we got to the top and all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: out myself, we're just like sweating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is not one droplet of sweat.
I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you remember, he also climbed that
mountain with shoes that had no shoelaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tongues of his shoes were flipped
out in front of his shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember just being like,
looking at me and Remo, we got like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like the proper shoes all tied
up good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I'm looking at the doctor and
he's just like, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of just like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a full on Jamaica experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the weird thing about that trip is
that when we sat in his little hut and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're smoking the living gold,
he kind of gave me some foreshadowing of
[SPEAKER_02]: what the next few years of my life is
going to be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have this captured on video
where he starts telling me that,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't worry, cannabis is going to take
care of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get you food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get you clothes and shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember him giving you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we should pursue this cannabis
thing, which, you know, obviously we did
[SPEAKER_02]: in our hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was 100% worried about all that
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've done it a few times
since.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this was in West Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he's still got eight foot long
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Mikey was his name and they
called him Geronimo because he used to
[SPEAKER_04]: drive so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Geronimo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he would just rip by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was kind of funny because he was
the super chill dude, but he would drive
[SPEAKER_04]: like an utter maniac.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember all the stash spots that he
used to have on his car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, dude, like these
stash spots are not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are the ultimate heat score.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's got his joint was like four
times the size of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like no, he used to roll these giant like.
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 grand joints that were only like that
long, but like that wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would just, he would just have it
hanging out of his mouth all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was definitely a character.
[SPEAKER_04]: He crushed sugar cane for us and made like
passion fruit, sugar cane, some other
[SPEAKER_04]: juice when we were up on top of the
mountain drinking one of the gourds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was authentic for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Mikey, the good doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geronimo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I absolutely remember the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it was like crashing against
the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful setting to make hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the nicest place I've ever made
hash in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are mostly videos of that to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm certain we filmed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did document the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure where it is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what we wanted to do today was film
this intro, do the cooking, but I brought
[SPEAKER_04]: the rosin press and I've got that turned
on and I thought maybe you could capture
[SPEAKER_04]: the rosin pressing for your channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can kind of cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you the money shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got the, we got the Sasquatch M1.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you brought the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nice unit.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm going to hit this dab real
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to concentrated X and everyone
else that is going to make this dab
[SPEAKER_04]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it's going to take off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like it's going to take off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I'm, when I'm hitting it,
I feel like it's just going to go like a
[SPEAKER_04]: spit, a fidget spinner or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've gotten away from my wasteful ways
of Q-tips and now I'm in the wasteful
[SPEAKER_04]: isopropyl phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, this is actually good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an efficient way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your bangers are always going to be clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually if you're dabbing on the go,
that's awesome because you can just like
[SPEAKER_02]: dab a hot dab, throw it in there,
it cools it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice that it doesn't chas the banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, these bangers are like 400 us
dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you've heated them up too much and
you don't clean the little bit of resin
[SPEAKER_04]: that's there and then you heat it up again
for the next dab, it just starts
[SPEAKER_04]: darkening, darkening, and then you have to
torch it to get it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of creates a foggy glass,
which I love the fact that he frosted this
[SPEAKER_04]: glass already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good idea to,
you know, poor Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's told me he's gone through like,
he doesn't buy these ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: He buys the Chinese ones that are like 20
to 30 to $40.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was like, he was telling me the
other day he went through like a dozen of
[SPEAKER_04]: them or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he just, he keeps chassing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You understand using cannabis for pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cold starts are not the best for using
cannabis for pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They truly aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like John likes hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: For preserving the turfs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get all the turfs.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But have you ever hit one that's just too
hot?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, Whoa, I am way
higher than I normally am.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all agree when you hit a
900 degree dab, you're just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: your lungs are on fire and your throat
hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grantor and I'm a level three now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can lift my grandkids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go with the tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it tells me exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That rip I just hit was at 570.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice being in control, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do we say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what order we're going to do
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to want to go check out Ramos
channel, um, because the rosin pressing
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're going to do and he brought,
what was the cultivar again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got frost fruit cakes,
which is like green base for everything
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could put the smell up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminded me of like engaged
smell-o-vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It even has the, the, the, like it has the
flavor profile of like the fruity smell,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then it even has that background
flavor of like the mildly stale,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever the cereal is made out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I'm down with making some rosin and
taking a dab or two of that because that
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I brought another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called acai berry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, and this is a little addition
from ripper siege.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best thing in my room right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to take some pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I always like the, it's not good
light rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for me to go and bring this up close,
but I could take a couple of pictures of
[SPEAKER_04]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't bring my best buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought like kind of smalls and mids
cause I knew we were going to be squishing
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, here's a couple of good buds
in there to pick out and smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured you wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like hash too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Wednesday I celebrate hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash Wednesday, you know, I do for the
Catholics, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have to pass me a joint a couple
of times during this video so I can go
[SPEAKER_04]: like this and then 400 people can write in
the comments, but nobody's expecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taken them before to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did it 10 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the way to beat it is
actually to pass them a solid hash joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those hazel hash sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well we're going to get to cooking and
we're probably going to get the pressing
[SPEAKER_04]: rosin to check out the rosin video.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to check, uh, go head over to
Rimo's channel and, uh, want to tell them
[SPEAKER_04]: that channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Urban Ramo on YouTube, youtube.com
backslash urban Ramo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, we're going to press some rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to get some pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to get some footage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it will end up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So make sure you go there to check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Sunday's cooking.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Remo as our guest rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me and I'm getting
cooked while you're doing time out.
[SPEAKER_04]: How big did we get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well we did some dabs and you can
check that out on my channel and we got
[SPEAKER_02]: mangled.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the most baked we've gotten to do
cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, have, have patience with us people
watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to have some delicious
Mexican food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you've done an exceptional job
preparing this already.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say that about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remo is going to be my sous chef today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no cooking experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can burn water, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today you're going to make some,
some good hummus actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never made it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's that made with chickpeas or
something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to eat it with, uh,
we have some cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be our side and then we're
going to have three different tacos.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have shrimp tacos, Argentina shrimp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are uncooked even though they look
cooked.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just from Argentina how they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have some, uh, halibut,
uh, deep fried halibut has been marinating
[SPEAKER_06]: in buttermilk and, uh, spices.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pamela.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to use this for the ceviche
actually that we're going to do too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on the side since we had a bit of
halibut leftover.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought we'd do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can try it right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a dry grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it okay if I just pick a piece of this
or go for it?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can see here, check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's pink ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yellow ones actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're super tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crunchy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Add a little crunch to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a third taco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there not?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a third taco.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a sweet potato taco,
which has pretty much come into a finish
[SPEAKER_06]: right here in the oven.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got kale and, uh, sweet potatoes in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're deep frying the other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some pickled onions that we just
made before too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll start this off for the ceviche,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to soak it with the lime for a good
like hour, half hour to an hour prior,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then add all the extra goody stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to put some mango,
put some red pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find cooking so much easier when all the
stuff's normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it a lot easier like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all like this, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And some jalapeno.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, it is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you've just got it all super properly
prepped.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a bit of cilantro in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bit, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got a lot of lime in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mix all of that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ceviche.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some pretty good meals over the
years in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barcelona's definitely got good food.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the tapas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way they do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Octopus salad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the tapas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like the paella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real Spanish food.
[SPEAKER_06]: For real.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that dubie going?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would be really good in here
too?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a bit of mint.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of mint.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his devices puffing, dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get mangled off those dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mangled dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, Sean?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're cooking.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're cooking with Marlon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the chickpeas in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the garlic in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, putting the garlic in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing the garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all in.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is tahini.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, organic fair trade tahini.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like a garlic, or a sesame
paste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, two of those?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, two of those and we'll load it up
with a bunch of olive oil in here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there's the second one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get a bit of water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll wash that off.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to make the nice color,
we're going to put these beets that I
[SPEAKER_04]: boiled for about an hour and then took the
skin off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to just turn this red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you want to hit it with a bunch of
pepper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, pepper it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an important step, I guess,
because otherwise you'll wear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with beets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean the window, the ceiling,
the skateboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a nice color on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like insane, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty nice, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it's kind of like a sandstone
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm with you, trust me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up, I was vegetarian until I was
probably 13 or 14 before I started eating
[SPEAKER_06]: meat.
[SPEAKER_06]: My parents were like super big hippies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lived off the garden pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we're going to have your dad on the
show one of these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert Plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like an old hash smuggler back,
way, way back in the day in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a red hair, so they called him a
haji.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, once in your life you have to go
to like Mecca and you can dye your beard
[SPEAKER_06]: red.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he had a natural red beard,
so they just let him everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Working in hash farms all over the place
over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some eggs in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whip it up, whip it good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do the shrimp first, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever you think, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess because they have less the shrimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do those next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Egg and bread, those things are.
[SPEAKER_06]: For this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke that joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, smoke that joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have something we can do though,
Remo.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to get him to scoop out the avocado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's already put the lemon juice on
there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just fell out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you want your avocados,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, it's like a bit of cornstarch,
flour, and some baking powder to make it
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of rise a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to coat it so that it seals for
the oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll get it in the egg and we'll
get it in some panko.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get one more avocado for Remo
in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll put some of these
ingredients in.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get one more bowl for the
panko.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dash?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more than I would want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the whole thing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same size dash of the red onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big dash of red onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another dash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dash up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two dabs, two dashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put some olive oil over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a little bit of olive oil in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of salt and pepper in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you got the pepper there,
I'll take care of the salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at you guys go.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cooking with Marlin right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll get a little bit of lime juice
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you like pepper.
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be good like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, is it supposed to be a red circle
or a green pause on the camera here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do that all over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been recording the whole time,
but I just thought I'd, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're baked enough for such a joke
to go over decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a few years ago, I was filming
something that we were judging one event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what event it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we spent hours and hours and hours
filming and judging this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we realized the microphone was
off, so there was no audio whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we redid the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always check to make sure your
microphone's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesson learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesson learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why my microphone and my camera are
just one and the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can never do it over the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that looked right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been fun, though,
if you guys just overdubbed it,
[SPEAKER_04]: watching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been, yeah, it would have
been hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just been like, oh, I remember this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you breading those shrimp up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very lovely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, Remo, do you want to wash your hands
real quick?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can take these and put them
into there and flip them around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you having fun, bud?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I making you work too much?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just surprised you don't have a joint
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is one thing that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's the problem when you put Remo
on making all this food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remo, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're back on joint duty.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll wash my hands for a second,
bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Paul did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul rolled up with the dab rig while you
were cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was cooking last night,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I got all my equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to sneak behind here.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fruitcakes it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosted fruitcakes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get on doing this halibut here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so now you got Remo rolling
joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a privilege right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The blue ice that's been doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and probably people that are
watching this video, they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they haven't smoked that much at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to go to Remo's channel,
Urban Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube channel to check out the rosin
pressing we did with his frosted fruitcake
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made some really nice rosin,
took some dabs, and that video was filmed
[SPEAKER_04]: on his camera, and it's going up on his
channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go check it out over yonder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it resulted.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll finish that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the last piece there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did you put in here again?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's buttermilk, paprika, like Cajun
spicing, some chili powder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some chili flakes, and some salt.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it's not good to be grinding
wheat where your food is going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what do you got there in your
grinder, bud?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this joint doesn't taste the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was chunks of onion in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have your grinder open where we're cooking
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chunks of onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some garlic in there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know what his turn is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving garlic here, you tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to go in the joint anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it tastes funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would know when something's up,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, we're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our oil's at 165.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start with the halibut fillets.
[SPEAKER_06]: The halibut fillets?
[SPEAKER_06]: The first two are always the tastiest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll still what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he the testers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you want to make sure the oil is at
the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put soup on the oven here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet potato mix and cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that didn't take long at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a fire here, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic Remo lighter holder.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the Remo lighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lighter leash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase your lighter retention by 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Increase your lighter retention a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst thing is being a stoner with a
joint with no lighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unacceptable, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to make a big plate today
instead of individual plating,
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone can just grab one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do whatever you like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said, Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one else heard you say it because I
hadn't pushed record yet, but I heard you
[SPEAKER_04]: say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some purple taste right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to spike these things like this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you for the first one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just toast that skin right off of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a green tomato?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tematillo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got to be the best job ever to be
given.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen anyone cooking food give
this job to anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you want to torch flamentos?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fun job, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to torch that avocado, too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's your avocado mix that you made.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's looking good.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fish is looking spectacular,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get these shrimps in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put some shrimps on the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's crack pavolin snapping over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing, Remo?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I wanted a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your dab right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stick that in the ref.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heat those up so they're nice and
retaining their heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make a duca here.
[SPEAKER_06]: A duca?
[SPEAKER_06]: Duca.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so you've got some almonds,
some sliced walnuts, some sesame seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: pumpkin seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have sunflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, sunflower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and what are the small ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: The chia seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: The small ones are sunflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, those are sesame seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now some hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of this coriander seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coriander seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little cumin seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, they're golden brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just toss them on the side there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cooking it up over here, Remo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The living gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a pea soup.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like there's parsley.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of garlic, olive oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be for the cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the people who designed kitchens
did they really think we'd only need two
[SPEAKER_04]: plugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people seem to have like,
I don't know, five, six, seven different
[SPEAKER_04]: plugged items.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention the electricians never put
it in the enough power for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get two toasters going at once on
the same circuit, you're sure to blow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to blow it for sure with the
microwave running.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that's one down.
[SPEAKER_04]: One down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ceviche is looking good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Ceviche is flavoring up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll put these tenatios in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to grind those up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where we put a bit of avocado
so it thickens it.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, it just turns to like straight
liquid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also going to jam some olive oil in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little olive oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little cilantro.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of cilantro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some onion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some onion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a bit of jalapeno.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a bit of garlic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Garlic and jalapeno.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, Merlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to add in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like such a nice bean sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's better than the last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You keep rolling more joints over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got 100% less onion in it,
regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less onion tastes better.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, actually?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that my joint?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I put it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this one still, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your brush right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Movember.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Movember one right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and Remo are matching this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Movember split.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strength in numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lighter just said A.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to move some stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to come over here?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got some of this on there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the pizou.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the pizou.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, the first one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we add this one too.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little crunch to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one down.
[SPEAKER_03]: These wonderful things here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take our hot towels out.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we'll grab these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do our first floor with these.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the sweet potato and leeks and
some kale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I miss anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I rolled a fresh joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like we missed much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just him putting these in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a nice bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fatay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Le fatay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fatay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fatay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Taco Supreme, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of this tomatillo sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it looks the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole lot of tomatillo sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the things you toasted up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just ground them into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomatoes and toast tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a bit of cilantro on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have some, I just pickled some
onions as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, gotta pickle some onions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Free tacos, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what if you made tacos and you
didn't have the pickled onions?
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be absurd.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be fucked up, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be absurd.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life's too stressful these days to have
tacos without pickled onions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, homemade pickled onions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that one's pretty much good to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now our next one, we've got some sriracha
mayo mixed up here with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: lime juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's the good early kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to put a little dabble on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little dab, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab me up good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab you up good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what, for the halibut now or the
shrimp?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for the shrimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
Merlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, that's not a... He doesn't wear
a wizard's hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes him no less wizardy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Rimo's avocado mix here with the
mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going on the shrimp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this is...
[SPEAKER_06]: So on point.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta eat good food when you smoke a
lot of good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I agree, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the best part.
[SPEAKER_04]: His buddy Paul was like, I've never eaten
any of the meals that Merlin makes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just eat them because Merlin makes them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just eat like meat and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we still have the halibut one to
go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez Louise.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of cilantro on these as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for good measure, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cilantro it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last one is the halibut,
which I put right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those pieces of halibut look so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of sauce do you put on those
ones?
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful fillet.
[SPEAKER_06]: These ones, we are going to go with a bit
of this as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to sauce it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sauce it up, buddy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have a fish taco with a good
spicy sauce is always tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look how tender they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just fell apart in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's looking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to mix this up with a
little bit of... A little coleslaw?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little coleslaw with a little bit
of vinegar.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little vinegar in the coleslaw.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of vinegar, a little bit of
mayo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tossing it in at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to have coleslaw with your fish
taco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make sense without it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Baja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I love your helpings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, healthy scoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Healthy scoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you have an appreciation for his...
You know when you see nice food and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, I hope I get a nice chunk of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy's just like, scoop.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy snaps, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to finish those ones off with
more of this tomatillo salsa here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finish it off with some green.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that's good to finish with
green.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe how good it looks,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all of it.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and then last up is the ceviche to
get plated and we're good to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a good car to have on the
west coast of British Columbia in
[SPEAKER_04]: November.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you don't want it to snows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't drive, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have a truck, so I can drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it snows too much, I'd prefer not
to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snow in the mountains is different than
snow in the prairies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: People from Winnipeg will be like,
oh, those people in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't know how to drive when it
snows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, we just have fucking
mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you don't know how to drive
within the mountains with snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole different deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a totally different... Just watch
Highway Through Hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a deal breaker, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's nice, the way you're
preparing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, little bites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you fucking kidding me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, I guess you know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so choice, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it red light there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Red circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red circling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what an absolute feast you've created
once again here, Marlon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go through quickly what
you've got here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, surprisingly, we pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remo helped a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was my first full sous chef in this
show that we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, turned out amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got fish tacos with coleslaw and green
tematillo salsa.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have vegetarian sweet potato tacos with
leeks and onions and kale.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some pickled red onions,
some cilantro and a bit of tematillo sauce
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have some deep fried shrimp
with avocado, mango salsa with cilantro
[SPEAKER_06]: and a bit of spicy aioli in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also have some roasted
cauliflower with beet hummus, dukkha and a
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of pizou, which is like ground up
green vegetables.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a pesto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's very colorful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also, for the rest of the
halibut, we were able to make a mango
[SPEAKER_06]: ceviche as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, let's eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we just take one of these full
trays or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys want to start with one of
these?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you serve it the way we should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appetizer first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, appetizer first.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we actually also have some pomelo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might note that it's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually was empty when Remo got
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Show that to the camera, like a building
thing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I'll take a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ceviche.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope it's salted good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fresh halibut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was medicated, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I got Mrs. Grower here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't say that was bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good heat in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the heat?
[SPEAKER_04]: The heat is jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the fresh from the pomelo with
the citrus and the lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That great texture, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crunchy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's up to you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about we each try a different one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm going to go for the first
one in front of you, which is the fish
[SPEAKER_06]: taco.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fish taco.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go for the shrimp, and you go for the
veggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not normally would he go for the veggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go for the veggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go for the shrimp?
[SPEAKER_02]: I volunteer for the shrimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I'll take the veggie one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not against vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fish is so tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of flavor in these veggies,
too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to put Taco Bell out of
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm not disappointed with my first
bite.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's once again wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: This taco was delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The perfect hummus, the beet hummus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so vibrant, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm telling you, there was some
zingers of flavor in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mouth is still kind of zinging from the
ceviche.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the ceviche is super fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, put that thing down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't taste like what I thought it would
taste like.
[SPEAKER_04]: No?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad for your first time producing this
meal, creating this meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: First time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is the first time I've ever done
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done different variations of this
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done exactly these ones,
probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always just play around and try and
do something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, listen, I want nothing more than to
just go crush this hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some other people who are
going to be enjoying, as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking with Merlin, episode five,
with Ramo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visiting and hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for inviting me over for all
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is way killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this fishing was deadly, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, go check over at his
channel on YouTube, Urban Ramo,
[SPEAKER_04]: to check out the rosin pressing that we
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to finish up the way we
should be finishing up, by respecting the
[SPEAKER_04]: chef and eating the food that he just
created.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot for joining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My compliments to the chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
