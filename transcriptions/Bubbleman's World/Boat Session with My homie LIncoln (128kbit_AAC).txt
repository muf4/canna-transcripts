[SPEAKER_03]: Everything behind us that's moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Sunday afternoon and I'm out on the
boat with my good friend, Lincoln,
[SPEAKER_02]: aka Marklar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marklar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Marklar and I go way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've known each other for, God,
it's got to be 15 to 17 years for certain.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both involved in the cannabis community
and industry back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, one of the original churchers
right here, when we used to do church,
[SPEAKER_02]: before it was called Hash Church,
and we used to go across the street to my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend Amir's place at Rime restaurant on
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: That 12-man table that we used to sit
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful 12-man table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made Hash in his bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, many different wearers, all the
different growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was pretty cool and it was really
the, it was how Hash Church was started
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was that concept years later,
you know, just this last year is when I
[SPEAKER_02]: started it, 53 weeks ago, and it was the
church that we used to go to that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how it evolved, the evolving of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are out on the beautiful house
sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got boats cruising by us in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a variety of mansions here just on
the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to kind of pull in a little bit
close to the houses because the water is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit rougher out in the middle and I
wanted to be able to do a video where I
[SPEAKER_02]: could have my mothership sitting out
without being worried that it was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: tip over and potentially burn the boat all
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to be out on the water after
church.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is freaking a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a great sermon today too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was hard to, it was hard to
come out of the gate after Hash Church 52,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_03]: 52, you knocked it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an unbelievable experience and you
could tell everyone was excited about it
[SPEAKER_02]: and they wanted to be a part of it and
it's those people wanting to be a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: it and getting excited that makes Hash
Church what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When certain people just decide not to
come or enough people decide not to come
[SPEAKER_02]: and be a part of it, it'll get boring very
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got to keep it... Topics
changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, keep the topics changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it on point and keep it up to date
with everything that everyone's going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you're in the US, whether you're
in Canada, whether you're in somewhere in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to stay up to date on all the
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed stories are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we're really rocking right now,
hey?
Woohoo!
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you ain't getting seasick out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit!
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey listen, I think it's time to hit some
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this turp rosin here thanks to Tony
Turpin, my man Tony Turpin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Sour D rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gently added to the Lindsay OG 90 micron
bubble hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took the bubble, we squeezed the
rosin out of it, we added the turpin,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we were hitting it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on twister.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if we were sitting on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because we were on the other side of
this big house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting actually brought up in a
very nice way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll move the boat if I have to at one
point, but I think for now we're good,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time to have a little bit of
a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally got the D-nail, actually sorry,
the dabinator today we have out on the
[SPEAKER_02]: boat hooked up into the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the power source is solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not worried about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, maybe we'll just smoke all the
rosin that I have here, Mar Clar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm totally down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Mar Clar is a South Park
reference for those that you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like, was it the Ethiopian
guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: They called everything Mar Clar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumping the border?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the ones that try to take the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, you're taking our jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I thought it was, yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the Mar Clars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mar Clars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's going to fix it because they'll
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people watching are like,
up to date on this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stupid stoner, you forgot what it was
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, come on, it's super easy to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about that Ethiopian dude,
I'm certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think all he used to say,
he had a spaceship.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was the one that went derpa
derpa.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was, that was derka derka is the
Arabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the Ethiopian dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, nonetheless, we're trying to
figure out all of our prejudiced South
[SPEAKER_02]: Park stereotypes that they mock and rip
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it feels like when you rip on
everyone evenly, that it's just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as you don't like one rip more
than the other, it seems like you're okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a Dave Chappelle sort of
way of going out about racism and
[SPEAKER_02]: prejudice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have an appreciation for the humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom of speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom of speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour dude.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rang me the first round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what this is going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bell ringer every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about earlier when we were like
literally like 200 feet behind the ferry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of cool.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went out earlier for a little
adventure, but we didn't bring the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of felt like, man, these guys
kind of missed out on a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_02]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll, uh, we went back to the house,
grabbed the camera and decided to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: short little, just a little video.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a little after church video.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rocker for you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take as much of it as you want or as
little of it as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do the whole damn thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it as you please, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I may cough all over the camera,
but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, good conversations in church
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly going to get a couple of more.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one more version of church might
be coming down the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a little branch of the,
of the church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really, once we get more into the R
and D of these terpenes, we're hoping that
[SPEAKER_02]: we learn enough about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we can actually produce, uh,
you know, an entire show on Terp Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the full explanation of terpenes and
more chemistry, uh, other than from just
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Scaldone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to get in a terpene expert that
I've been, uh, going back and forth with
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get into church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, I just like the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the bioassay, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burn it and test it or smolder it and test
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's so nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: May I take a look and smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: You sure may.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the discussion that you guys were
talking about the parchment paper and
[SPEAKER_03]: about trying to find your next thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I found out that was really
interesting today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean that piece right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solvent and that taking away that little,
and you guys getting paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't cut it up into sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I grabbed this little bit of,
uh, rosin today and put it on a fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of parchment that had never been
squeezed or used.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also love the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, uh, you know, maybe at the
end of it, maybe we will come to the
[SPEAKER_02]: conclusion that parchment was the best
that we could do, but I highly doubt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the discussion will lead to
bettering the whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, glass would be your next one,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of people are talking about
glass, but I'm, you know, first glass
[SPEAKER_02]: won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do well under pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have to be some sort of special
glass on to crack and smash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also it potentially holds heat in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it'll be a lot of
different minds coming together to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you get enough people trying
things, leave something behind or you just
[SPEAKER_03]: get it off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, stainless is once again,
it's like, yeah, this is, this is easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: remove and put on and collect from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a transition, transitionary,
uh, process of the process where you go
[SPEAKER_02]: from the butter, the hash, squeeze out the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to squeeze it somewhere to get
it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now oil slick pad, parchment
paper, PTFE, all of these things have been
[SPEAKER_02]: used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, everyone argues
this is better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I suggest that I really don't know
which is better, but because I'm smoking a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the product, I would like to for
sure know which one is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's really why we bring up
the, uh, not the argument, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Discussion for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think like something like a
template or a small little like piece,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then you're getting into a metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's, those are the presses,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like obviously metal and glass and all the
things that presses would be made of would
[SPEAKER_02]: not be what we would be collecting rosin
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not going to happen like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have some sort of little
interface like this, like when a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: cracks and it comes out of the hall,
there's a little membrane that allows it
[SPEAKER_02]: to slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the, um, out of the seed hall
without being damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, skunk man, Sam mentioned it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's an actual name for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little piece and it were,
and I believe most seeds contain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just allows the embryo to slip
nicely out without the root or the
[SPEAKER_02]: caudaladon, which are those first two
round leaves of those plants, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps it from getting damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we're, we're drifting in nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you keeping your eyes open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your eye on the big log there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, three feet away from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, gotta look out for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably in about eight to 10 feet
of water right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe about 30 to 50 feet off of the,
uh, the shore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be probably about what 16,
17 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost feels like maybe 18,
19.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like it's up there, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like close to 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful day out here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burning on the back of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanted to share a couple of dabs
with you guys, share a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: view out there with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and uh, yeah, I don't know if I have
really much else to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dabbed, we boated, we chilled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a successful little video
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks for, I called right after.
[SPEAKER_02]: I announced that I was going to put my
boat on the, in the water after three and
[SPEAKER_02]: a half hours of us talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy literally called me a minute
or two after hash church and was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: went offline and I was like, Hey,
Marklar, you know, co-pilot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I put it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally just put it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's under the seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to pull it out at a weird
angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of push it in and then pull it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How it kind of fits one way, but not the
other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: How big is that log?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a dayender.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that in your boat going a full
speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many different worries out there today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had my boat in the water for
several months.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys watched on periscope that day,
when I cut in front of the big yacht and
[SPEAKER_02]: I, and the periscope went dead and nothing
else was said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at that point I had problems with my
engine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I shut the periscope off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I eventually got towed in and the motor
needed a ton of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for two months, the motor has been
rebuilt, replaced, overhauled the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: nine yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pinned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pimped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now the boat is, I've got motor
confidence, which is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tight, very, very tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how many logs are out in the ocean
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's busy out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm sure we could go logging
out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally could go pull out a thousand
logs out of this ocean, a little chunk of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest with you, you could pull logs
out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be probably very beautiful to
clean up and do some woodwork with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd just be like, yeah, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of them come from,
uh, you know, log booms, believe it or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of these logs that are perfectly
cut, like that one and that one and that
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the cut on them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are from log booms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other ones that have been fallen trees
that contain the roots, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a mixture of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple telephone poles right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the vision they got, the view
they're getting in the background of Anvil
[SPEAKER_02]: Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of Whistler area behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drove up, that's north right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would avenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would eventually end up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see the seal behind us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a seal right there swimming
in the, I've been desperately trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the whales and the dolphins this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, they've been eluding me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see them from my deck and it's
just like, I want to go and have a little
[SPEAKER_02]: dab session with the whales and share it
with the bubble man's crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that it would be something
that they would really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, uh, we're just going to
continue dabbing on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, we won't blab on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much else to say, but thanks
for watching bubble man's world guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sharing your time with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you haven't already, please give
the subscribe button a click.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have already subscribed,
maybe give us a thumbs up if you liked the
[SPEAKER_02]: video.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the ship?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitting steady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steady shipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much, so much to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stick to the course now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Won't stray away now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick to the course.
