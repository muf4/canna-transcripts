Oh shit.
Shit.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, oh my god, I'm gonna be fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this doesn't work, I'm gonna be fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, just work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck!
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck!
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I fucking cannot believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucked up, with my D-nail just
pooched.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: What an utter mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I could just cry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just... Hey guys, welcome to
Bubble Man's World and welcome to
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam!
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here at the Hotel Krasnopolski in my
room on the main canal here and just
[SPEAKER_04]: really just super stoked to be here,
I'll tell ya.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got here, I got a little excited,
I set everything up, I was ready to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: hit with you guys, and then I looked and I
realized I plugged in the D-nail only into
[SPEAKER_04]: a converter and not an actual power,
like it doesn't convert the power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more like it changed the plug,
but it didn't really change the power.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened to me many, many, many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happened is I pooched this whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I pooched this whip and I pooched this
bowl, because it works with that bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this bowl again is fine, it just needs
to get another perfect size whip for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the guys at D-nail had sent me
this other whip with a much smaller hole
[SPEAKER_04]: and a much smaller bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little smaller of a bowl than
I'm used to hitting off of, but I gotta
[SPEAKER_04]: tell ya, to have something as opposed to
nothing is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some beautiful sweet skunk dry
sift here that's just ready to puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think it's gonna be a good
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already been in touch with Jen Doe
and Mike, and they're hopefully gonna hook
[SPEAKER_04]: up with us a little later on today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony will be arriving in a couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I might just go head on over to Skunk
Man Sam's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's hanging out with Robert Connell
Clark.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be nice for me to go over there
and puff some bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly doubt it that they're gonna let
me pull the camera out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they do, I will absolutely get a
little quote from each one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunk Man Sam's very, very non-camera
friendly, so it's very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Rob, I bet he gives me a little bit of
an interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned for that on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for now, let's have a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I am in a non-smoking room,
so I probably will blow this outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't I show you guys what's going on
out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got a little bit of construction
happening here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working on the canal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down in front of the place, you can see
they've got a little bit of a thing set up
[SPEAKER_04]: right up in front of the bulldog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just down that way, you can see the
building with the green awning.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the world famous greenhouse,
where you'll see Franco and Aryan and the
[SPEAKER_04]: rest of the greenhouse crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Amsterdam in a nutshell is a really
cool place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to arrive on a day with a little
bit of blue sky, no rain, and a really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice warm temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be 10 or 11 degrees Celsius
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate that there's a little bit
of noise out there, but we can close that
[SPEAKER_04]: off in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's about three in the morning
for me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost four.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just really stoked to have you guys
here at the Cannabis Cup with me in
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably gonna have one more rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I'm gonna wait for Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I'm gonna go hook up with
Jen and Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably gonna end up just jumping in
a cab and going and seeing my good
[SPEAKER_04]: buddies, Rob and Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the start of the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are gonna see a ton of cool shit
this trip, I promise you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get some great interviews,
and I'm gonna make a point on just having
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of fun as we always do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned to Bubble Man's World,
and we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, Tony, you can keep talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not interrupting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep talking about Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are talking right now,
and I thought I would bring you guys in
[SPEAKER_04]: because it was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you guys wanna go around and
introduce yourselves, you guys just got in
[SPEAKER_04]: the Gold Coast, just walked in the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And introduce yourselves, go around,
and tell us a little bit about yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: from Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah, and you guys got some entries
this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's going into the cup this year
from Gold Coast?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some flowers, Thin Mints,
and we have some collabs with a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: different good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they mentionable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a Crockett Collab,
a Tangy Collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some collabs with TC Labs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very excited about those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we came around, speaking at TC Labs,
Tony was just talking about how he tasted
[SPEAKER_04]: all the different OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it OGs that you were talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about different
entries in the collabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the flavors and the taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's high on fucking taste right now,
and it's really great that he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of it, he's got these incredible
pure terpenes that he's extracted off the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of just hitting pure dabs of
Dry Sift or Wet Wash, we're finding that
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes he'll mix the terpenes in with
the hash, with a little technique that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other times, he'll just drop it right
on the dabber, right after you've hit your
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a chaser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a terp chaser.
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems to be the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens to be really a great way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's keep going around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at Brandon.
Brandon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brandon, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm just hanging out and relaxing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any entries in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is my Hoogs and Peter Mueller
shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when was this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a recent piece, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got this on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never been hit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how fast pictures of these things
go out of, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They are created, and they hit social
media.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes in three pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a seriously, I would guess,
extremely valuable piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm shaking holding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate holding glasses like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, Flav comes over to my house all
the time with $30,000 and $40,000 pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, oh, let's hit this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, dude, you left your piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: They left an FTK at my house one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: A real big one, like this big,
slime green.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Fab Klein Taurus or a Fab Taurus Klein,
the mothership one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got all of the main mothership perks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the Fab A, which is just a
straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's got, no, it's actually blown
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's got the Taurus and then the
Klein as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So completely ridiculous piece,
much like the one you brought.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say we do a session with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you willing to just throw this
portfolio?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the thing about quartz is this is
hot as fuck, like half an inch above my
[SPEAKER_04]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can always pull it out,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way quartz dissipates heat,
this isn't hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like brand new hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm always amazed when you actually
grab that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do it with glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: If this was a glass bowl, it would be hot
right down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would burn your fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would burn your fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can even feel the heat as this
finger climbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say right here is where it's really
quite hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can touch here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's perfectly hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: James here from Gold Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: James.
[SPEAKER_04]: James, you were the first, you two were
the first dudes I met and I met them via
[SPEAKER_04]: Hetty Heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is your brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've never actually met Hetty,
but I saw him come across, I think it was
[SPEAKER_04]: through Instagram and immediately it's
interesting how you can find out the
[SPEAKER_04]: quality via the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you have this quality,
generally, you're going to be pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your standards are going to be up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Dry Sift Wizard throws that all
into disarray because he's not really the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest quality dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not having ever met your brother,
I believe he's a pretty high quality dude,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I saw those photos,
right away I was like, man, I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke that hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only way to... He has a lot of
passion to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all about the sift, but he's the
real... He might be coming out here
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure hope he does, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd really like to puff a bowl with his
hash and I'd love to... I wish he was here
[SPEAKER_04]: in a session like this, which is pretty
much every session that we have had since
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quality folks, pure Terps, and then maybe
show you the anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's peed through that around the
other day and people were like...
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't have any smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony also extracted pure anthocyanin,
which is the color that climbs up the
[SPEAKER_04]: capitate stocks of the glandular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you've seen my macro photographs,
many of you have asked over the years,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is that purple color?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's anthocyanin and it's an
antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tony has also extracted a pure form of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll take a picture of it with the
macro camera so you guys can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus we want to see this under the macro
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that in a few minutes once we
stop filming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should look like fibers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what were you saying we should break
this in?
[SPEAKER_05]: With the sweet haze dry sifts,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So haze terpene?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not for his first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to stain the bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to stain the bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes terpenes can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about that with the tangy.
[SPEAKER_05]: My bong is stained mad, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tangy is notorious for staining
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy, gilly, and calio, all very citrusy
and orange-smelling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why if you take a dry hit out
of my mothership right now, it basically
[SPEAKER_04]: tastes like gilly.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a hint of coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told Don and Aaron the other day about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, you know, the tangy is kind of
like the in Spinal Tap, where the guy's
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about his amp, how it goes to 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, all right, man,
all right, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it goes to 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's louder than any other amp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else's amp.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after 11, after that's the best,
then let's talk about 10.9 and 8.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the tangy is so loud, it's like
everyone tries to compare it to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stains everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barb's around a 10.5 when it's full melt
and done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've only ever made it from seeded
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's seeded barb that he's just got so
much of.
[SPEAKER_04]: He cures it for weeks to a month plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before he even does like a shake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he'll collect like a half pound
full bag of barb, like just a big giant
[SPEAKER_04]: bag of yellow pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep that for like a month or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then gives me some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three little piles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or three big piles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe one big pile, kind of a medium
pile and a really small pile, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: generally the pile that most of us would
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never get the big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just never works like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're dealing with things like,
well, terpenes are no different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure glands with trichome heads,
even the anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's such small amounts of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at this, you have to imagine
how many.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably from several plants or
one huge giant plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a tiny little like half gram of
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small amounts of these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who's next up on the shoot?
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys literally just flew in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're probably in the situation that
Tony and I were in yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's hard to say because we
puffed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we puffed tough, but those guys
puffed tough, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love to smell our yesterday crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is basically what we're going to
be doing a ton of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to invite you guys into some of
these sessions with some of these heady
[SPEAKER_04]: folks that we hang out with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not even surprised that,
when I first saw Brendan, I've seen him
[SPEAKER_04]: for years, but not really connected with
him, but always know him to have some sick
[SPEAKER_04]: piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I met you, we talked last year at
the show at the Marcel and Deline and Dan
[SPEAKER_04]: Crane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took photos of the two pieces you had.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a mummy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had, what was the other piece?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a slot cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: For whatever reason, with the spray
painting in the background, the shot I got
[SPEAKER_04]: of your money was so fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the best shot I got, literally,
the whole cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the one shot that I thought was
like, that's artistic and it's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I framed it right and the piece looked so
fucking gangster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Captured that trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really, for me too, that is my last
year Canada's Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might have even had it in a yellow
Pelican case.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it in an orange one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange one, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, it's hard to remember these things,
but that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't remember the guy's name or shit,
but I remember the Pelican Cup a year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken, dude, I remember the piece you had in
that dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about four and a half inches tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't remember your name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you just hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so it's all in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nice to have a beautiful piece of
glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's crack the window for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, if we set off the fire alarm here in
Amsterdam, we're looking at about a $5,000
[SPEAKER_04]: euro fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the fire department gets dispatched,
that happens after three minutes of the
[SPEAKER_04]: alarm going off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna hope not to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually I have this fan set up too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the neat thing about the Sweet
Step Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it does create somewhat of a
great racy, not really anxieties for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for some to get a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really what I would consider
strong resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like happy resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's uplifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely sweet haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you get a rocker, like what he
just took, you can really almost feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a little racy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, did you just get off your
flight this evening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even want to puff much else
other than this today.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little coffee jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm getting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely one of those pipes
that's really no need to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually hits amazing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could actually taste that better than I
could the Mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe just because it's brand new as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's small too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_05]: The taste was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: How good was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Taste the full Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you get the spice on this piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get them both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you Peter and Chris for this
piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always shout out to glassblowers
worldwide, especially for guys like this
[SPEAKER_04]: that take it to a level of quality that is
equal to the level of quality that these
[SPEAKER_04]: hashes are also at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you could call it a standard,
if you don't like the word quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it implies that, oh I don't like the
idea of implying that you're better and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just call it a standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all deserve the highest standards,
don't we?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a quality of standard that I
can get behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sweet is going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comes in some case like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can't own a piece like that
without a palliative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're actually carved it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a nut jar or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually is the dab dish.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dabbing dish that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you have a heady piece,
you might as well carve the titanium too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just booted it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that the D-nail whip goes with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the green coming off of the sneaker
is just all like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably get a custom whip that's all of
these colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if a piece like this were to go on the
market, not that it would, but if it were
[SPEAKER_04]: on the market it would sell for many
thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because here's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only hit two of these sneakers before
and it was at the Toronto Champs show and
[SPEAKER_04]: this dude had both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had one for him and this girl had one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think it was Johnny Blaze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny, I just mentioned this to a
glassblower friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, I go, how come things always,
the smoke always comes in a certain way
[SPEAKER_05]: and percolates?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I go, the fogs go down like this and come
down on a 45.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what about going down just right
away and start percolating?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, it needs percolating the other
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same way it's percolating up a Swiss
perk, it could be percolating down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perks like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what it's doing then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Endless perks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's literally perking on the way there
and then clears in the chamber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure Hayes terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that with Tony in the background
and James.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm so glad that of all the people
that could come up here, it was you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: today and this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like perfect, nice quiet session,
super heady pipe and pure terps from Tony
[SPEAKER_04]: V.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you look over at me and you see
the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us the hell's angel emoji.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell's angel emoji.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell's angel bank emoji.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it in this paper and smash it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a little lemon to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemon hells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemon hells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemon hells.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go do one quick tour of the
DNA sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA shop here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we can get a better light on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the salt collab.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an oldie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be going back close to 10
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're at the DNA shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known these cats for about 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe 13 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met them at the first cannabis cup about
10 or 11 years ago in the herb industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA clothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, see you later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of DNA's trophies.
[SPEAKER_04]: No shortage of trophies these cats got.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, it's time to go hit some hells
angels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That
[SPEAKER_05]: was tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitting dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back stage, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like
[SPEAKER_05]: an Arnold Palmer, but if you had
strawberry Arnold Palmer, it tastes like a
[SPEAKER_05]: lemon strawberry tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Savi, Tony, and Arend hooked up
with these guys at DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tony, of course, has the turp
meltdown.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just sort of made a fresh batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you hold that up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put it at an angle and I'll get under
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a good press test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hit it under the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's about dabbing someone out with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Duncan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what Tony made.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the original product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing this is from Jibs,
from the melts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it kind of looks like a crazy face.
[SPEAKER_04]: This piece of hash right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that in the camera?
[SPEAKER_04]: With an open mouth.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're totally trippy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then over here we have some cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thin mint cookies that the Gold Coast
extract guys brought by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took shots of those with the macro lens as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure we share those.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready for a dunk there, Tony?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it under the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, turn the fan on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Point it at the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our key.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: As fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does this almost every hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep hitting it, dude, because it's
smoking still and that's what's going into
[SPEAKER_04]: the sky right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does look pretty smoky up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll see soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: As fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_04]: As fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: As fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a smaller dab for the apartment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I tried to go with a little tiny
ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was the tiniest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty big when I saw you drop it
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks small in the big guy's hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just go with what I really need to get
iry and I have a pretty high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take huge dabs all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I found was that, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I feel it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to attach it back onto there
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to want it to go, is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going to hit good, though,
in big.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might as well get this ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotel puffing in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we being so freaky?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of a 5,000 euro fine and kicked
out of the hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're going to be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a fine size hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much reasonable out of either.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't overpowering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as it smells.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because of the way it's in the
final product won't be like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be surprised what this looks like if
I pressed it up like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll look very much like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even that was a little ball I just took
and then what I did was I did this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that's really a little bit too big
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could take it all day long, but not to
take it perfectly, walk over to the window
[SPEAKER_04]: and blow it out nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still a pretty big hit and that was
half a small ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted you to see with the Citrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Citrix banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty orange banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice combo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That boat's getting ready to go out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all got their hoodies and shit on,
candles and nice party.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking party, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a party.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was enough gapping for now,
dude.
We'll see you next time.
