[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that happened,
but yeah, I restarted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm going to have to upload this in
like two podcasts.
Damn.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can continue, continue on gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if you're not one sec, if you're not
going to continue to share the screen,
[SPEAKER_05]: cause that's all anyone can see right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to make the second half
better than the first half.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way everybody won't even tune in to
the first half because it's go right to
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually one minute warning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be 420 and Kate,
Kate Verdu in one minute, 47 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my last point on that and we can move
on is that in the lab, they're doing that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, maybe a nasty workup to get
there, but that is that compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what they're doing the initial round
of safety testing on, like we have this
[SPEAKER_03]: isolated drug that was made with all these
fluorinated, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So safety is based on the nastiest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm sure they progress and
they're doing continuous safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but in theory, the drugs may even get
safer than when they started, cause they
[SPEAKER_03]: were made with a cleaner process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideally in the discovery compound is
purified to absolute purity, a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: percent purity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point I was trying to get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to that CBC,
made with that nasty process, I just had
[SPEAKER_03]: shared, if was brought to purity costs,
who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause maybe it's the elixir of life,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a rich guy and maybe I'm going to
try CBC first and see if it lets me live
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm willing to spend whatever to get to
an ultra pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how nasty the process was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe, maybe you can run it through
the wiper a bunch of times, clean it up
[SPEAKER_06]: enough, and then make a distillate and
crash it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, I think the point is,
and Marcus, we can move on after this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to belabor this point, but I think
the 4200 discussion, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: is more along the lines of this is why we
need it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be produced in a regulated
environment because of all these potential
[SPEAKER_06]: things that could potentially happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this guy right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That he says, Oh, my method works,
but everybody else's method shits on
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody else says that everybody else
has got toxic shit by his stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's really clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, we, we don't know, but if it's all
manufactured in a regulated environment,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a way where we would know what the
right SOP is that makes something that's
[SPEAKER_06]: safe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully they would have the right
analytical techniques in there to know
[SPEAKER_06]: when a batch does not meet product
specification and you got to throw it
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, when a product doesn't meet
product specification for vape,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they put it into gummies.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the solution of, Oh,
I can't get this through a vape COA
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturer because they're going to look
at it and say, what's all this other crap
[SPEAKER_06]: in there, but you put it into some dark
oil and put it into gummies or chocolates
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, dilution is the solution to
pollution, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we have to say about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike West, you're being quiet over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like you've got some things to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ultimately a lot of the hemp
processors had to look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as they're processing and working up hemp,
you are going to be trying to isolate them
[SPEAKER_01]: in general CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That CBD during the isolation,
you're going to obviously pull off the
[SPEAKER_01]: other cannabinoids, which saw the
increased valuation, but also saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of accumulation of THC that
then had it get remediated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have looked at, you know,
obviously turning those other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: into potential revenue streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, many of these hemp labs are trying
to generate revenue streams in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: unique way, whether by isolating or
remediating or converting those
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids into other cannabinoids and
formulating them into different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of those things that can be
done safely, but obviously I agree with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mark needs to be done in a regulated
environment because we want we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: products being sold gas stations that
haven't been produced in COA because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's obvious legal ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody who, let's say we're producing
it and it's a product that causes somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who eats a gummy bear out of the truck
station to become intoxicated due to some
[SPEAKER_01]: side effect that could create liabilities
for the gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gummy manufacturer or whatever,
whatever product manufacturer and those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those lawsuits have yet to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of a, you know,
precautionary tale that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that come back and bite our industry
in the ass and create these legal
[SPEAKER_01]: ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting to see that there,
you know, with the development of CBC and
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta A, you know, it's a wonderful way
that we can mitigate THC as well as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, convert some of the CB CBD into
new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously if we distribute them as try
and distribute them freely, instead of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, say distributing them in adult
only venues, then it can create a unwanted
[SPEAKER_01]: attention that comes back and ends up
generating a negative publicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which leads to negative regulatory
environments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some states that have now
passed bans on Delta A, even though I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say that Delta A is probably a lower
risk than the recreational THC that's
[SPEAKER_01]: found in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, Mike, I was on a,
I was on a zoom call the other night with
[SPEAKER_06]: a group of cannabis executives,
both on the hemp and on the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fellow who invited me on wanted me
to kind of break down Delta A and one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the stories that was shared was an
executive who again is well versed in the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis space and a long time user and a
CEO of a large cannabis company in
[SPEAKER_06]: California and traveled to an area and
bought some, actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what he told me was they went to the,
the vaping expo, which is typically mostly
[SPEAKER_06]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly nicotine products and device
manufacturers and whatnot, people who work
[SPEAKER_06]: in those supply chains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said this year, it was very
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it was 20% nicotine, 80% Delta A,
80% of the people at the vaping thing were
[SPEAKER_06]: all Delta A hustlers or Delta A product
manufacturers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he brought back a couple of products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's back on the plane in California
with him and he showed an energy shot that
[SPEAKER_06]: he said, yeah, he had, you know,
first-class tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he had a really comfortable seat and
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took a shot and he said about 10 to 15
minutes later, he had an incredible
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling of, of wonderful euphoria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he'd never experienced with Delta 9
and being a long time user, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's like, wow, this is the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is wonderful because it tastes
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so he took a few more sips of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he said about 10 minutes later,
he started feeling a knot in his stomach.
[SPEAKER_06]: About 20 minutes later, he broke out into
a cold sweat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the last three hours of that
cross-country flight, he said it was the
[SPEAKER_06]: most miserable flight he'd ever been on
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was incredibly high, had feeling of
anxiety and paranoia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And was just thinking, oh my God,
this is sold at bodegas and gas stations
[SPEAKER_06]: to 16 year old kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it gets you fucking loaded,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably chuck loaded with that
ISO THC isomer, which we don't know what
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of impact that has a long-term and
short-term health.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This does need to be regulated because,
and I think again, some of the correct me
[SPEAKER_06]: if I'm wrong, but some of the biggest
markets for Delta 8 now are some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: most cannabis unfriendly states.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the states that don't have a
strong Delta 9 lobby.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you see like what's happened in
Colorado and what I believe was happening
[SPEAKER_06]: in the other states is the Delta 9 lobby
doesn't want Delta 8 at all, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They want you, you know, there's a certain
level of rigor when it comes to Delta 9
[SPEAKER_06]: production that's just not applied to
Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hate to sit on a cannabinoid because
I know it's safe and I know it's a good
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid and I know it's good for those
kids, but it's just so unfortunate that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're in this situation that's only been
made possible through the ridiculousness
[SPEAKER_06]: of prohibition itself, that we're stuck in
this current situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know how it will resolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Canada, when Canada passed the
regulations for THC on the federal level,
[SPEAKER_01]: they made it actually not just THC,
but the extraction of all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to do any of the
cannabinoids, CBD or THC, it all falls
[SPEAKER_01]: under the recreational processing
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can separately get licensed for
production or processing of hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the minute you start extracting it,
then you have to have the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, and you know, ultimately that's one
of the things that has yet to be addressed
[SPEAKER_01]: once, I think once you have the FDA
involved, you know, whether it be a food
[SPEAKER_01]: product or a drug product, topical or
ingestible or inhalable otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to have to implement some
production regulatory environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in general going to require a
requirement of COA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to be able to have a
COA and you know, that's going to be not
[SPEAKER_01]: only required by your insurance broker,
but also by the federal regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: commission in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be the FDA, potentially
the DEA or ETF.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's one of those things that's
regulated, you know, if we're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: caffeinated beverage, you know,
or a THC beverage, you got to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that that beverage is not going to be
poisoning your customers because those
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory requirements are going to make
your insurance too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you know, bad press, poisoning your
customers, you're going out of business,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things in the
unregulated industry, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the hemp processors kind of fall
in that legal gray area where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: operating on with a state hemp license,
but many of those state hemp licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, that regulatory framework doesn't
cover all of the, you know, not only the
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, but chemo synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that as the Food and Drug
Administration gets involved on a federal
[SPEAKER_01]: level, that you're going to start to see
you know, CBD, THC, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: isomerizations, the correlation,
and other, you know, hemosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: conversions require safety trials before
they go to a commercial market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that, you know,
can be done at universities here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, but when we were trying to do them
down in the States, we ended up having to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at you doing those product trials
abroad because doing research at
[SPEAKER_01]: universities is difficult with the night
of monopolies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that with this news, a couple
weeks ago, that's going to open up the
[SPEAKER_01]: door because we'll actually, some of the
licensed producers will be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, you know, work and develop,
you know, genetics that are formulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can extract and formulate them and
prepare them, but I mean, it's a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: coming and then you don't, we don't want
to hold our breath for, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell the patients to hold their breath to
be able to formulate these products for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until the federal regulatory framework
comes out, we kind of need to use these
[SPEAKER_01]: forums, peer review and peer self-regulate
and use that self-regulation to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: better industry that can set an example so
that we can educate the regulators on what
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be included.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm actually quite appalled that
there's still states, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the licensed states that allow
recreational still don't require pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them did and there's been ebbs and
flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington had an outright ban on aerobic
bacteria, which was really bad for the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a couple of years after
regulation on the recreational level,
[SPEAKER_01]: they allowed some bacteria, they just
required you to test the mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, and then other places,
you know, Oregon's always had a fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: strict pesticide thing, but I don't think
Oregon required heavy metals in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: round, heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the other states,
you know, California's kind of had more
[SPEAKER_01]: progress that they started fairly loose in
the medical scene and as its transition to
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational testing has gotten a lot
stricter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think each of those states are acting
as lab works, laboratories of democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have no doubt the feds
are keeping, paying attention to seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening in each of those states
and working on a federal level to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how they're going to create those
regulations.
But.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, to everything you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and and ultimately,
Mark, I mean, because it is chemo
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, the conversion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's interesting because Dustin
started talking about just basically the
[SPEAKER_06]: isomerization of Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm sorry, the isomerization of
Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just starting with extract and
distilling it down to a crude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you have Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now all I'm going to do is throw a
little bit of dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I play at this, which is bed night play.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what these acidic plays are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you if you push a roller
coaster down the hill, it goes down the
[SPEAKER_06]: hill and it doesn't come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the thing with Delta.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that that way of making
Delta eight and enriching a distillate
[SPEAKER_06]: sample with Delta eight is inherently more
safer than a chemical conversion of CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: isolate through Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or to to Delta eight, I don't know if I
just confused everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So converting Delta nine into Delta eight,
I think is safer than converting CBD into
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a full spectrum, you know,
that's in your music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say a CBC hash organically grown
hash, if it's grown organically and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivar that naturally expresses
those cannabinoids and turbinates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be preferable to process them
naturally.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to having to worry about,
you know, taking taking another
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid to go through the dirty
chemistry, which can be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have waste products and we
all we as environmentalists want to
[SPEAKER_01]: minimize those waste products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's no longer an extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess, you know, again, on the other
side, I'll say, well, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_06]: take an extract and throw something
natural like clay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is acidic, not realizing that also
cleaning up the color is converting this
[SPEAKER_06]: extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I guess that's better because
you can't form the other iso THC that way
[SPEAKER_06]: because the THC ring structures are
already formed, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I inherently just thinking that that's
a safer way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have to make Delta eight,
have a Delta nine license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta eight with no presence of anything
other than just the crude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like a kind of heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just heat and whatever came off the
plant was basically the wheels of the
[SPEAKER_06]: roller coaster going down the hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: You use acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what acid does is acid makes the hill
of the roller coaster goes down smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: Acid lowers the activation energy in
between Delta eight and Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what you're doing with heat is you're
just pushing it down the hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, you got to remember, you did that
in glassware, right, Dustin?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glassware is acidic glassware,
essentially in and of itself is silicic
[SPEAKER_06]: acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So silicic acid is an acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so the software itself can catalyze
this reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, you shared a paper with me that was
basically just heat turning CBD into all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of crazy different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just through heat alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm smoking a bowl in a glass pipe,
I'm getting all sorts of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: conversions just from the heat right there
into my lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a guy out there, Marcus Rogan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see his talk, but he gave a talk
last week or a couple of weeks ago about
[SPEAKER_06]: he's doing some aerosolization studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if he's got the joint smoking
machine or he's at UBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that guy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so he's doing Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: What he claims is that the THC never
vaporizes and never reaches its boiling
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's some aerosol formation of liquid
THC in the in in weed smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the other interesting aspect about
is he said that, yeah, he's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: what is, you know, joint smoking?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, weed smoke is not hot enough to
vaporize THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you talking about the actual hots of
the joint?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's thousands of degrees, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's Marcus Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just it just I was like, this sounds
really familiar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went into my phone and my emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I reached out to him on February 27th.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got back to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I just sort of spaced get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got back to me twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm going to have to send him back
an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd be an interesting guy to get on
church.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I know him, truth be told.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think some of his ideas are a little
flaky at best and just they're they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: always scientifically grounded.
[SPEAKER_06]: So would make for a very interesting,
lively hash church discussion with Dr.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morgan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you called him out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to kill me now.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I'm just saying, you know,
to come up with this concept that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: not actually vaporizing THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, OK, then then how does my
dad rig work?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm creating some kind of aerosol that
jets through the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't just doesn't sound grounded to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I want to welcome best friend in the
house and Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Josh and Kelly, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that's what you guys are up
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what farmers do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what the Dragonfly Earth Medicine
farm crew has been up to as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: You look frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else is moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were you were frozen and I couldn't
hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I suddenly heard you while I was.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, yes, I think you're coming through
better now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's give that a shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like a psychedelic experience to
see if you're like hearing us or if we're
[SPEAKER_07]: talking and it's like glitchy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're on time and you're off
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: But big love and respect to everyone here
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we appreciate the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just wanted to say, you know,
in response to what you were saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, we do feel like, you know,
these conversations are incredibly
[SPEAKER_08]: important.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do feel like all facets of the wheel
need to be discussed in order to
[SPEAKER_08]: understand how it rolls evenly and
equally.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like the Dharma wheel.
[SPEAKER_08]: If all the spokes on the Dharma wheel are
not taught perfectly, then the wheel
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't roll properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of these conversations are all
part of the spokes of the wheel into us
[SPEAKER_08]: finding our ultimate health and our
ultimate placement on this earth right
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how are we going to move forward this
plant?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that all of these
conversations are incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're always going to we're always
going to uphold the spoke in the wheel
[SPEAKER_08]: that is the full spectrum, that is the
fully regenerative, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's our expertise.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we uphold.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we want to say how much we respect and
admire this conversation and the deep
[SPEAKER_08]: science that goes into it, because it is
important to have all of the colors of the
[SPEAKER_08]: rainbow involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we're humans, because we're all
part of the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hugh, humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we talk about the trees real quick?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned you guys are having
something, some issue up there with your
[SPEAKER_03]: old growth and that maybe Dragonfly was
involved as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they'd be great to share.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not directly involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just very active nature beings.
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in a mountain region and we are
actively protecting the old growth in our
[SPEAKER_07]: area as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Fairy Creek on Vancouver Island and
the Fairy Creek blockade is now the
[SPEAKER_07]: longest standing blockade in Canadian
history.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been at least one hundred and
seventy five people arrested in the last
[SPEAKER_07]: safe three weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an amazing it's an amazing standoff
in the woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, we've been supporting it in
every single way that we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been marches all over British
Columbia, even in New York.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to really follow the lead
of the indigenous nations.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is their land.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is so.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're really talking to them directly
at Fairy Creek.
[SPEAKER_08]: The elders and the chiefs that own the
land outright are trying to be in
[SPEAKER_08]: communication with the federal government
as well as the provincial government.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not really getting anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are trying to help distribute
information to the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to disseminate out the
information in a proper way by getting it
[SPEAKER_08]: from the indigenous nations and following
their lead.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the ones who've been up there for
the hundred and seventy five days.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been up there since August.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a 10 month blockade all through
the winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Canadian government released
an injunction that allowed Teal Jones
[SPEAKER_07]: Group to go in and log the last old growth
watershed valley on southern Vancouver
[SPEAKER_07]: Island.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Marcus said before, there's only
two point seven percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to I want to be really clear
with everybody that these old growths are
[SPEAKER_08]: really massive yellow old growth seeders.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will not be using these old growths
for really anything other than paper or or
[SPEAKER_08]: some kind of a fiber board or toilet paper
because it's not a hard wood.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what what the ultimate reality is in
logging old growth forest is that they
[SPEAKER_08]: want to be able to have the land so that
they can replant it with the fur and the
[SPEAKER_08]: single species so that they can turn it
into a higher commodity piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they replant it, then it's worth more
money than the old growth standing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just build on that by saying the
yellow seeder is a different subspecies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the seed or most of the seed or you see
on the West Coast around you, Dustin,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of it's.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's poor door for speed during an
order.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very rare, very awesome from Port Orford,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: The yellow's theater has a magnificent
incense flavor and a magnificent flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The natives used this either to create
coast up in some cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's there's stories of them going all
through Polynesia.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, back in the day, the Haida Gwaii
natives currently were on the Senex nation
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Senex nation in the Kootenays has
been called extinct.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are now winning court battles to
prove that they have a place here,
[SPEAKER_07]: that they have a language that they have
just lifted last month.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently, they had just become legitimized
again as as a as a native indigenous
[SPEAKER_07]: nation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also near the Tanaha Nation and they
helped save Jumbo Pass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumbo Keep Jumbo Wild was a very important
environmentalist mission.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's also the Trans Canada pipeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a tremendous amount of energy
in the native and indigenous First Nations
[SPEAKER_07]: community to stop the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people can look up the tiny house
warriors and the braided warriors and so
[SPEAKER_07]: many other people that are that are on the
front lines in central and northern
[SPEAKER_07]: British Columbia to stop the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're just really getting out very,
very little information to you all.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really highly recommend that everybody
go directly to the Fairy Creek blockade,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is on Instagram, Trans Canada
pipeline, or Trans Canada pipeline and the
[SPEAKER_07]: wet suet and checkout.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have said that wrong so that you can
learn directly from these people so you
[SPEAKER_08]: can get the proper education.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that we're, you know, we're not saying
the improper things, which is just so
[SPEAKER_08]: incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there has been terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, I have to take a second here,
actually, because just last week in
[SPEAKER_08]: Kamloops, there was 215 bodies found
buried.
[SPEAKER_08]: Underneath the school, the residential
school in Kamloops.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the residential school for the
indigenous nations.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last residential school closed in
1998.
[SPEAKER_07]: Residential schools was an amazing,
horrific schooling operation that tried to
[SPEAKER_07]: break the native connection to earth,
to break the First Nations connective,
[SPEAKER_07]: to disassociate them completely.
[SPEAKER_08]: From everything that they were about to
take the native out of the human was the
[SPEAKER_08]: goal of these residential schools.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have the cape.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two, three years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if that isn't a call to all of
humanity to support all of us,
[SPEAKER_08]: then I do not know what is.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we are not waking up and recognize not
[SPEAKER_10]: figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: That this is the demise of humanity that
separates us that causes us to find
[SPEAKER_08]: problems in all different people,
no matter what color they are,
[SPEAKER_08]: no matter what race they are, no matter
what religion, no matter what
[SPEAKER_08]: socioeconomic, no matter where they live,
no matter how they feel or think.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time now for us to react.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time now for us to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of this needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also really important to look up
missing and murdered indigenous women in
[SPEAKER_07]: Northern British Columbia, just to
finalize the respect for the oppression
[SPEAKER_07]: that's been happening against the First
Nations people there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please look up missing and murdered
indigenous women in Northern British
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you feel called, put it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at our story every single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Contact people every single day right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call as many people as I can in all
facets of life to bring awareness to
[SPEAKER_07]: certain situations, including cannabis,
including farming, including food,
[SPEAKER_07]: food security, medicine security,
living security, the time is now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been locked down.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're fired up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're ready to roll.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got gardens to support us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got spring water to support us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have animals, everything we need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we need to rise, like rise up out
of the rhizosphere, out of the soil,
[SPEAKER_07]: become empowered, humus beings,
and now make change through our actions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to use our white privilege to
support brown people on the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in it right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is absolute imperative.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what side you stand on.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are being hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are being harmed all in the name of
big corporate nature and big corporations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to say sorry, not sorry for
bringing such a heavy load onto Hash
[SPEAKER_08]: Church, but we're all feeling it right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our DM is being blown up.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are losing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Left, right, and center.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to come back to center.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to come back to source.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to come back to love.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to come back to happiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fear has no place in our future
togetherness and our future health and
[SPEAKER_08]: wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dustin's been talking a lot about the
extractions and stuff, but also he's an
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing regenerative cow farmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's another thing that's on the
chopping block in Oregon to get rid of
[SPEAKER_07]: meat and animal husbandry all together and
create faith and take meat as a claim
[SPEAKER_07]: towards climate change.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we agree with keeping nature systems
alive because we are nature, as we said in
[SPEAKER_07]: the chat, because we are nature,
we think it's important to uphold nature
[SPEAKER_07]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Dustin, for that work and
everything else in the chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big love to the family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make this happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were the change we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without us and other people like us and
the crew, shit's going away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just appreciate everybody out there
in the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what an amazing crew of cannabis
culture again, over and over again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard some negativity, but always
positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have been hitting us up in the
DM and checking in with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're checking in with other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big love to the family.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to tell you that no matter
what is going on in the world and no
[SPEAKER_08]: matter what kind of walls people are
feeling and come in on them right now,
[SPEAKER_08]: the magic is still there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bigger and it's brighter than ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's more and more people that are
awakening to letting go of fear and taking
[SPEAKER_08]: on love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for coming in and sharing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was indeed heavy, but it needs to be
talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything you guys said was super on
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hate to bring it even heavier,
but that 215 is literally the tiniest tip
[SPEAKER_05]: of the iceberg that is the genocide of the
Indigenous population, which just seems to
[SPEAKER_05]: be, like you said, it's the war on nature,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They speak for the trees, truly.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the Lorax was ever based on anything,
it would be the Indigenous people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it kind of makes sense that
whatever this is that just decides that it
[SPEAKER_05]: needs to destroy nature, the nature
destroyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like the Indigenous people are
involved and embattled in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's partially racism,
but it seems to be even heavier.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on how deep the rabbit hole you
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get where you're coming from,
Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably racism, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go deeper down the rabbit hole,
I think it's good versus evil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like that oldest energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the weird thing is, and I was talking
about this with my wife the other day,
[SPEAKER_05]: that life itself is tension.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's tension between birth and death.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that tension is held your whole life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all feel that tension.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that kind of seems to be the value
that is life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that you can't ever, because my wife
was like, oh, there's just so much evil in
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's
balanced.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there can only be a certain amount
of that and a certain amount of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the tension between the
two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on where you navigate in
that tension, shit can get heavier,
[SPEAKER_05]: shit can get a little lighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to hear what you're saying,
Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you go down the rabbit hole with
racism, you find yourself in a situation
where you're like, oh, I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find out we all came from Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is really that simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for people who are blinded by
ignorance and anger and hate, kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, going back to that sort of
good versus evil again, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're tapping into that energy,
you're you know, it's just happened there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh, I'm watching the YouTube video and
you're talking, but it's it's delayed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm thinking, oh, dude,
what I want to hear from you, Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm mildly stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Party of one stoner party of one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to be baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to be hanging out with all of
you guys and chilling on a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's probably take a smoke and
have a tab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like the age and clear the air,
some incense in Asia, some sage and a
[SPEAKER_07]: cedar bough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lavender is often in the smudge sticks.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, best friend farms big enough
over there, you know, some Tulsi,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, those kind of things are
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some cherry pie could be really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really support this brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Echo Electruary down in in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They this one's one of their single
source, but they do a lot of partner
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he does the best job I've ever come
across of getting the profile of a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: into an extract using a hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're great guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they support it's three to the B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So three percent of their profits go
directly back into B conservatories.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all their own on site apiaries
where their grows are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They practice regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three to the B.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was met.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have a thing to share.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's it has to do with Nick Rizdin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyone who doesn't know the Nick
Rizdin is can look them up online online
[SPEAKER_07]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lime Rising Farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick Rizdin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing person.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been through Lyme's disease is one of
his battles.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's led to many different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's Lyme's disease with multiple
different bacterial infections from the
[SPEAKER_08]: tick bite.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he has just gone in for some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily therapy, but they're
they're looking at his brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going in for testing to try to put
him into.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really want Nick to come on and he
will another time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of this I'm paraphrasing he's
going to have much better words.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to tell us exactly what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just sort of giving a rough
overview.
[SPEAKER_08]: He went in.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted to see what kind of things
they could throw at him to instill a
[SPEAKER_08]: seizure to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: He can get up to 300 seizures a day or.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to and to look at those seizures on an
EKG machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had him, you know, hooked up
everywhere on a brainwave machine as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's what they found.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so this first picture he just shared
with us this morning is them trying to he
[SPEAKER_08]: goes into grand mal seizure and they're
trying to stop the seizures with every
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of drug anti-seizure that they use or
his brainwaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even even they tried to give him a some
beers, which he knew wasn't FDA approved
[SPEAKER_08]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: They threw everything at him, you know,
all of the Adderalls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we don't have any more, which they
had taken away all of his medicines
[SPEAKER_08]: because they wanted to throw all of their
medicines at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was allowed to take the mycocana caps,
which is what we make, which is just a
[SPEAKER_08]: blend of mushrooms and the mushrooms from
old from old growth forests.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, they're mushrooms from old growth
forests mixed with hemp grown
[SPEAKER_08]: regeneratively and a bunch of different
adaptogenic herbs, compounded,
[SPEAKER_08]: adaptogenic, intelligent herbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he took 12 caps, a big, a big dose.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then 45 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is almost straight lines, completely
complete and total.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, complete, completely balanced,
balanced.
[SPEAKER_07]: Calmed and they were amazed and it was
amazing to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not onto the incredibly intelligent
conversation that you all were having
[SPEAKER_08]: before is that when we're dealing with
these adaptogenic secondary metabolites,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, they change.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only do they change in the making of
them, but they change in the uptake of
[SPEAKER_08]: them and the response of them as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's sort of hard to to to calculate
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here we are being given a really
awesome representation of the power of
[SPEAKER_07]: natural medicine and herbalism.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and a person who's putting both
of these things together really
[SPEAKER_05]: beautifully right now in a book that I'm
listening to and it made me kind of want
[SPEAKER_05]: to reach out to him and maybe invite him
on to Hash Church is is Rupert Sheldrake's
[SPEAKER_05]: son, Merlin Sheldrake, who wrote a book
called Entangled Life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is really worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's like a twenty dollar book or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eighteen bucks or you can just get it on
Audible and listen to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is Merlin in his voice sort of
reading the book, which I find really
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it just kind of is tying in a lot of
what we're talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gets into the sensory science.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's talking a lot about the myporrhizae.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been you know, he went to school at
Cambridge and basically studied a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: variety of different sort of synergies
between plants and learning about
[SPEAKER_05]: bacterias and viruses and how they can
like transfer their DNA to one another
[SPEAKER_05]: horizontally and bacteria can take just a
really super unique and awesome
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot about the mushroom, a lot about
the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, if you guys haven't heard of
Merlin or you haven't checked those books,
[SPEAKER_05]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. James White, who studies the
rhizophagy cycle and endophytic and
[SPEAKER_07]: endophytic bacteria and fungi and plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants have mycorrhizal fungi attached to
their roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly at the tip of the of the roots,
you have the rhizophagy cycle,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is where the root transforms the
nutrients and the and the trace minerals
[SPEAKER_07]: and brings it into the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, often in soils, there's pathogens all
around the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul Stamens always talks about how can a
one celled or a single walled organism
[SPEAKER_07]: live in soil with trillions of pathogens
potentially killing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of its microbiome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of its biome and its
capability at the tip of the root and the
[SPEAKER_07]: rhizophagy cycle to pull through things
that are only beneficial to the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a cycle that the body does with the
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_07]: When our biome is healthy, we uptake
what's healthy for us, just like the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants in the plant root zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to suck up what he's tested is
all the endophytic fungi and bacteria that
[SPEAKER_07]: enters the plants through the soil are all
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of them are pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plants not suck.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could get attacked from the outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could get attacked because obviously
plants have issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what its magic is and bringing in
chloroplasts and plant blood is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be a beneficial reaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we want to create medicine that
enhances that process, because that
[SPEAKER_07]: process is what makes us humus beings and
from the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what gives us our ultimate
protection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else is actually throwing it
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the chemicals in the water,
the different chemicals, the toxic,
[SPEAKER_07]: everything is throwing off our magic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our magic is so powerful that there is
medicine and foods and water and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything trying to take it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you take it away and you become
strong, it's unbelievable what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all in the tension.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, it's all in the tension.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have one without the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's where we come from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's where we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure it's why we get trapped in
that sort of same sort of we just have and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just our human nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the whole part of being here is to
divide and to become more like,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, I don't want to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you come from everything
and go to everything, kind of fractioning
[SPEAKER_05]: out and being like your own sort of
individual self and finding your tribe is
[SPEAKER_05]: is kind of what it's all about while
you're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I promise you, whatever your tribe is,
you're going back to everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's hard to fit all of that,
you know, into a body.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just just that alone is just so
complex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thankful every day because of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to be in a body without
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Dragonfly, guys, have you have you
played around with Koji at all?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And working with Koji.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you tried catching Koji, like
catching an aspergillus strain?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we haven't caught anything,
you know, and defined it or, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: captured the DNA of it as Koji.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've ordered Koji and done all different
kinds of grow out of it in different types
[SPEAKER_08]: of bean strains and even adding greens and
adding kombu.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yeah, going down the rabbit holes of
seaweed and its interaction with it and
[SPEAKER_07]: the pH and seaweed really exciting and,
you know, taking away the gases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And why do you ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just finished Koji Alchemy and I've been
talking a lot with a guy on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: TM Gastronaut, super great people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I started playing around with like
miso marinating my steaks, which is cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the miso, it's not active.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ordered the aspergillus starter.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal is to make it easier to
incorporate specifically liver is what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And liver doesn't taste beef liver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the most it's not the best
tasting thing, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So giving it to a usable state without
just using a massive amount of like bacon
[SPEAKER_03]: fat, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was talking to him about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, how does it do with liver
paté?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, it's excellent because it
imparts that sweet, nutty flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's blended, it becomes like
an amino paste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting you're basically making
like a miso, but you have a different name
[SPEAKER_03]: out of a liver paste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the rest of you guys, if you don't
know about Koji, it's a mold type fungus,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's like a micro filamentous fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sends its filaments down into
whatever it's on and puts out exudates
[SPEAKER_03]: that convert the proteins, carbohydrates
into sugars, which then the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in its symbiotic relationship,
that's that's that function they were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about earlier, where the mushroom
makes this and the plant sucks it up and
[SPEAKER_03]: it gives up little parts to the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got this little relationship
going on, provide for each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one kind of funk is like a
decomposer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stakes or chunks of meat like that,
or you can blend it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you when you blend it up,
it's much easier for the micro filamentous
[SPEAKER_03]: to get down because you've got all mixed
in the solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can turn this beefy tasting liver
paste, which sounds terrible and tastes
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of terrible into something magical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it tenderize the meat at all?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it tenderize it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you do it on a steak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you do like a reverse,
this is what I did with the miso paste is
[SPEAKER_03]: marinate it for like 24 hours in a miso
soy white wine mix and then did a reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: sear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So brought the steak up to like one
hundred and ten and then seared it on a
[SPEAKER_03]: really hot iron skillet like a cast iron
skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Mallard reaction with the miso
paste was excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, like the charred out the
black and blue, it was it was primo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like they mentioned
earlier, these are from my holistically
[SPEAKER_03]: managed cattle that we we raised just up
up the street on some pasture that we
[SPEAKER_03]: lease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that system's working out great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never been fed anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They drink water off off the property.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just the better we do, the better the
grass grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have multiple years of soil
test data to prove that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: sequestering a significant amount of
carbon through these animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also own a bunch of land up on the
hill and practice broad scale permaculture
[SPEAKER_03]: in various systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the only animal that's ever died at
the cow pastures, other than maybe a snake
[SPEAKER_03]: got stepped on once by a cow or the cows
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything out the elk love it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The deer love it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have beavers creating dams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got snakes, I got birds, I got
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing there has ever died.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never killed a single slug on a
permaculture farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to grow greens is to be fair,
we're in the forest, we're in the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: of forest trying to grow some annual
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is just slug genocide up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's a constant battle with
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to get more of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when I when I look at cattle
farming or, you know, and one step better,
[SPEAKER_03]: is this permaculture system that we're
developing is with the intent that it
[SPEAKER_03]: provides such a bountiful production for
the native wildlife, that I could just not
[SPEAKER_03]: have to do cows anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the elk, I'd much rather just get a
couple elk and eat that throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to manage them the rest of
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I can provide a system that makes an
abundance of elk, that's a much better
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that that's our long term goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to convert, you know, a patch of
forest into a food forest in the middle of
[SPEAKER_03]: the basically food desert, an industrial
forest, like the whole thing's monocrop
[SPEAKER_03]: for timber production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're talking, that's all of
Southwest Washington, like 98 percent of
[SPEAKER_03]: the land down here is owned by timber
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just I'm just I plot myself in
the middle so that when hemp destroys the
[SPEAKER_03]: timber industry, I'll be primely set up to
expand my permaculture throughout all
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What will become a liability?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what do you do with a bunch of trees
when of you know, it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: right now I can buy hemp plywood for about
half the price of like timber based
[SPEAKER_03]: plywood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get that online or at a local
building store?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me let me dig it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone sent it to me just the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pull it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plywood's like tripled and quadrupled.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of control.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working with the hemp that we
brought last time we were on here and we
[SPEAKER_07]: weighed out 12 seeds and you know,
to a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's those kinds of hems that are so
huge that we feel can make a difference in
[SPEAKER_07]: the timber industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're you know, we're working with
InPlanta and Darrell Hudson out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: University of Saskatchewan and helping
develop, you know, those food and fiber
[SPEAKER_07]: strains that that will make a difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can replace the pellet farms and
all of the toilet paper, all those things
[SPEAKER_07]: so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone knows it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can offer and it can offer like no
problems to the entire cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_08]: because he's not ever seen them flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they've never flowered out before.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just keep growing and growing and
growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they create beautiful cellulose,
beautiful silicates and you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: great fiber and no flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this three quarter inch thick
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixty bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you know how much that's like at
least seventy five eighty dollars at the
[SPEAKER_03]: at the store right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the half inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: What glue are they using, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're using six star bubble
hash, actually, as they glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a six to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never been, you know, a thing that
that was biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I wouldn't necessarily
expect that of hemp board.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's still like, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't possibly be as toxic and as much
of a bummer as the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: These things, can these things be so
boarding and decking is one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it could be used as cladding,
it's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But can it actually be used as the under
carriage lumber underneath a deck?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, OK, decking, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it could actually be
used for like in place of like two by tens
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's it's not treated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not treated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I just showed you is plywood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it's structural.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use it as sheeting on a
building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what plywood or you could use
it as subfloor above those joists that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was going to yes, you could 100
percent make structural pieces out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be in an I beam configuration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm building a house right now and the
traditional lumber, the long stretches are
[SPEAKER_03]: plywood going this way, plywood going this
way in an I beam shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's just as strong and
significantly lighter than the alternative
[SPEAKER_03]: current would beam.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had old growth, it would that's a
whole different story, much tighter grain,
[SPEAKER_03]: yada yada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we're talking about like the
future of building and we're going to use
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, it's going to be composite pieces
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a lot of structure just by
changing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the real beauty where where this stuff
isn't quite at yet, but will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they said they've got huge hemp
plants, what we really want is 20 foot
[SPEAKER_03]: tall field grown like corn, basically,
because those long fibers are where the
[SPEAKER_03]: strength's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I take a bunch of very long
fibers, press and glue them together,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get exponentially more strength than a
bunch of particle board.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they can start they can start even
putting shorter fiber into oriented strand
[SPEAKER_06]: boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: So oriented strand board is all the wood
chips off the bottom of the of the
[SPEAKER_06]: sawmill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they do is they press those
together into a laminate and glue it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the glue turns out to be the magic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, there's lots of cheap
sources of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how to orient those fibers to get the
real strength, the modular strength of the
[SPEAKER_06]: fibers themselves is definitely a trick.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think this can certainly be used.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question I have, I mean, even for
outdoor cladding, though, Dustin,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would have to be again, the biggest
thing outdoors is ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ultraviolet light will degrade lignin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you just put a piece of untreated
wood out in the weather after about a
[SPEAKER_06]: year, it turns gray.
[SPEAKER_06]: After about two or three years,
it'll fall apart because all you have is
[SPEAKER_06]: cellulose.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've completely degraded all of the
lignin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the real question is, is how stable is
the matrix that holds all that together?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will be where some innovation
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same issue with plywood and then
if that's going to be an issue of I've got
[SPEAKER_03]: wood that's going to be outside,
then I treat it with some usually pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: toxic chemicals.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in nature, I just do a better job of
material selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my cedar that's going to be exposed
outside is fine because it can go 100
[SPEAKER_03]: years underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wood that's naturally resistant to
degradation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I need to go even further,
I'll char the end of it before I stick it
[SPEAKER_03]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's going to last at least two
lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a product called Lifetime.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Dustin, if you wanted to finish up
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the siding or cladding,
as Mark said, you can use a product called
[SPEAKER_07]: Lifetime.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made up here in the Kootenays,
but they send it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guys from the European family and the
European coveted recipe or something,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's powder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you put it in five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, it smells like rust water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget dioxide, what the main component
is in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the main component is in
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the main component is in
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you do is you put it in a five
gallon bucket or bigger and you use a
[SPEAKER_07]: paint sprayer and spray it on natural
wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like a, I, they say an herbal
fungal mineral mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kind of darkens the wood a little
bit, turns it a little bit green,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's a totally natural finish that you
can spray on super easy, almost just like
[SPEAKER_07]: water out of a paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just used it on our last timber
frame structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we used, we did the, the show,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoegi, Shoegi band, the, the,
you know, the charring.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did that for Borden battens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did like one by eight and then did a
baton that was charred.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of this interesting look of
like black and dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that part is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there's great milk based paints out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys have a milk?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have three neighbors that have saw
mills.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have one at the moment,
but I like the idea of getting an Alaskan
[SPEAKER_07]: chain mill only for the rawness part of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see it as a great building
material tool, but it's also like,
[SPEAKER_07]: we make mountain biking jumps and
greenhouses and all kinds of sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: landscaping style building.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that works really good for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have really amazing mills near us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do salvage wood out of clear cuts
and on the sides of roads and definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: out of our lake for sure milled up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lake is a big source for us for full
trees and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine you have like, do you use wood
burning heat in the winter on site?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have some managed timber production
and in that sense, you're probably
[SPEAKER_03]: coppicing, pollarding, whatever your,
your source is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just gather it because we live
literally on the side of the largest
[SPEAKER_07]: wilderness area in Southern British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_07]: So raw materials are not a thing for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it from your zone four on the outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a matter situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just, you can get it really easily.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just get dead, dead, dead timbers that
are already down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we make sure to leave it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we're really conscious about
our, yeah, how much wood we burn as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have spruce, hemlock, fir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cedar, pine, and.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys have any rocket mass setups,
any rocket mass stove or heater or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not right now, but I have two greenhouses,
my Wallopini and the round one,
[SPEAKER_07]: which we call the mothership is something
I really want to build a rocket mass,
[SPEAKER_07]: more of an earth fired stove, which will
have water going through the beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I also put a 300 gallon septic
tank in the center of the greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_07]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once the water starts flowing through,
it can go into a holding tank in the
[SPEAKER_07]: center of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's also air tubes for four inch
air tubes, going a thousand feet in the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground, six feet under, and then coming up
in the center.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like the idea of doing somewhat
passive, somewhat passive geothermal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thermal battery pretty much the air
tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you catching all the hot air from the
peak of it and then sucking it down into
[SPEAKER_03]: the ground?
[SPEAKER_07]: At the peak of it, I'm, I have just
sandwiched two layers of plastic in
[SPEAKER_07]: between a full two by four full two
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to put four air tubes going
down like north, south, east and west and
[SPEAKER_07]: gather the hot air from the top and then
put it into the roof at the bottom because
[SPEAKER_07]: the snow accumulates near the base.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get any.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heat from any of the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be all the gathered at the hot and
then sort of force it through,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, like forced air to make a little bit
more of the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're on homestead time and we don't
hire out work.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything is magical and has its
divine timing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this lockdown has been very good for
us working on our farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we always laugh about how really and
truly like being somebody that can't
[SPEAKER_08]: focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or being two people that can't focus on
one thing for very long, whatever you want
[SPEAKER_08]: to call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It works good for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It works great for farming just in case.
[SPEAKER_05]: What cannabinoid is that again?
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked your penilein.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a terpene, not a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's why I like it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's best for and what have you been
planting on your farm in the last week or
[SPEAKER_07]: what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's can you tell us what you've
done in the last stay the last?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Dustin, I had you use ducks for
your slugs because ducks and cows get
[SPEAKER_07]: along really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They love ducks are really easy on the
garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can go all over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you let the if you let the cows
raise the baby ducks, then they'll protect
[SPEAKER_08]: them from any predators in wherever you're
now raising enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had lots of ducks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no ducks now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only ate maybe one of them and the rest
got where we feed the wildlife.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I'm like Mecca in the middle
of the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: It like there's nothing to eat anywhere
until you show up at my spot and then
[SPEAKER_03]: there's everything to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, small, eat plants, eat animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't do shit like we keep our we lease
a bunch of land down in like the flats of
[SPEAKER_03]: a slough about 10 minutes from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we raise our cattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not yet integrated up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think I'm going to integrate
cattle up into the hill farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I just don't have enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might bring some of my small Dexter,
but I think we'll probably do sheep like
[SPEAKER_03]: the like the haired shedding sheep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're in the process of fencing
it, you know, without fencing to try and
[SPEAKER_03]: get established with these trees,
because when you're at when you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple thousand trees in the ground,
it's a lot cheaper just to fence the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing than to try to fence each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we're at with that right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will move back into fully integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've ran a lot of chickens with the
cows just to control flies was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've seen eagles eat my chickens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen little like marmots eat my
chickens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen cats eat my chickens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's endless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with the ducks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody loves those chickens.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sitting ducks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, they did great for the slugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an awesome solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll we'll get back to it when we figure
out how to keep them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say that Tony Nag gave a
beautiful he calls it CBHD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the new term.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's CBHD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what else?
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to say one other thing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Aru Aru Giff said, please say hello to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would make my day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if that's not the easiest way to
make someone's day, let's all say hi to
[SPEAKER_05]: Aru Giff in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Aru.
[SPEAKER_10]: Aru.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke them if you got them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke them if you want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of interrupt their guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's their first farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dustin, have you considered using raised
beds with rocks like right dead center in
[SPEAKER_02]: your cutout for those greens with like a
rock fringe, even crushed rock around the
[SPEAKER_02]: rock raised bed for like just a really
central rock raised bed, which would pick
[SPEAKER_02]: it up off off the ground for those slugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like any rock sand border,
probably shardy kind of rock situation
[SPEAKER_02]: might help a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lay off my my beds that are right in
the middle of the yard for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even nearby other beds that aren't,
you know, they're they're centered more
[SPEAKER_02]: into the middle of the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and once this property that I bought is
it's just steep downhill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every everything that's flat,
we put there right with with terraces.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the whole thing integrated into,
you know, terrace, swale pond system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yes, some of the beds that are up
close to like some of my access roads,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are a lot of them are just rough
rock roads.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they and they're all raised beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just use cedar that we thin for the
boundaries of these beds and they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: raised.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that I'm I'm on the I'm
like I said, Mecca in the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that desert is on the edge of the
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 110 inches of rain a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is the amount of slugs is next
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little yeast traps are are just
destroy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can get back into ducks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another problem is that rocks are
extremely expensive here because it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've dug 40 foot down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Into the ground building ponds that I've
never once found a natural rock on the
[SPEAKER_03]: property anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been this level of for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I got to bring them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, wherever it's a bad place for
slugs to be is usually a good place to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow your greens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my work actually some more sand like a
sand fringe around something which is
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper than the rocks and local sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have much that we have
a lot of sand in Maine and I'm on granite
[SPEAKER_02]: bedrock mostly I like really, really enjoy
my old pasture site, which is the one spot
[SPEAKER_02]: on my land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to cows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 200 year old pasture land and
everything on that grows just amazing all
[SPEAKER_02]: on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really keeps regenerative and you can tell
the difference with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big thanks to cows and cow poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fungal colony.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you say richness to it
that I get even for the quality on the
[SPEAKER_02]: turps and tastes into my heavily local cow
poop, you know, pretty good percentage,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably 20, 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hand fields probably half 50% neighbors
cow poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go from there three seasons now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your biomass ever hit ever hit for
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever tested your biomass for
microbial infection?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super healthy field in terms of just what
I see anyway visually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been running some tests this
year into soil, obviously tests on the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and the plant matter itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any flags pop up or dug
deep into having further testing into the
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leftovers or other stuff goes right to
the compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, with that pretty quickly
and yeah, super healthy, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I ask is in particular,
all the Amish around here use a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: manure in their hemp farming, yet their
COAs, they're getting hit for just total,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not E.
[SPEAKER_06]: coli.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just total bacteria or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly what Mike said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally aerobic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and what they come back to me is they
say, well, you know, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and so my interpretation of that,
and Mike, tell me if I'm correct on this,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I don't think they're streaking
plates.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe what they're doing is they do
some sort of genetic analysis and that
[SPEAKER_06]: determines that there was DNA of this
bacteria on this biomass at one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now the biomass is ground and dried
and it's totally fine and totally okay to
[SPEAKER_06]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these guys are all like, well,
wait a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got all this microbial and the
numbers are like in the hundreds of
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of colony forming units.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't exactly know how to
interpret that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know more, but I, my, my field is
pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you kind of mentioned maybe like
the, the dry out for it, for the bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: die off perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and if you're going to keep it,
well, I know that like wet and moist,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to harbor environment,
at least set it up for your fungal and
[SPEAKER_02]: your bacteria to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my field's pretty dusty dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of why I did that is it's on top of
bedrock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's whatever loam I could
scrape up after clear cut and mix,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of 50, 50 with the cow
poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my cow poop was aged.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went in on that stuff, it was at
least one year, even two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it was two plus years old coming
into cow for, you know, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also broke down age sawdust in on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of straw, local straw and sawdust.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not cow poop anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you gotta, you gotta realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same bacteria that's in compost is
also going to be ubiquitous within your
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be being blown around on the
air currents and moved around by the wind
[SPEAKER_01]: and the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately the, the same lactobacillus
that's coming out of the helping the,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping the milk turn into cheese is also
going to be ubiquitously bound on your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material in the field, as well as
during the drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should inhibit the mold as long as it's
done in a, ideally a cool and dry
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, what's going to
happen is those microbes are going to form
[SPEAKER_01]: spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those spores are then capable of being
grown when they're in a suitable
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes people aren't trying to
plants fast enough, or you're getting that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial degradation that we were talking
about earlier with hydroxylization
[SPEAKER_01]: happening either in the field,
you know, the wine industry, they call
[SPEAKER_01]: that noble rye, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually make sweet wines because it
increases the sugar content.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's some hydroxylization that
I'm sure is going on when we have early
[SPEAKER_01]: rains in the cannabis industry that may be
forming interesting napnoids that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: only now being able to detect the high
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Mike, it's just hydroxylation.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no is in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hydroxylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, as long as it's in
that biomass form, you're probably going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have that mold then that chance of
microbial growth and degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sooner that people can either turn
it into hash or turn it into extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the less degradation of the cannabinoids
and terpenes that you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, it's, you know, ultimately
it's something that the Washington state
[SPEAKER_01]: had the zero tolerance on all aerobic
bacteria at the first two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was tough for a lot of the organic
farmers because they wouldn't pass and
[SPEAKER_01]: they would then have to grow cannabis
organically and then process it through
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of extraction that filters out
any of that microbial content.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's no microbial content.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just measuring DNA of microbes
that lived on the plant material during
[SPEAKER_06]: the harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, you know, isn't, you know,
if you're doing some kind of extraction,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's no, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the labs though in state labs will
just do the plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I'd say the minority of the labs
are actually doing the DNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA sequencing is probably more suitable
because then you can actually identify,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rather than identify whether
it's a good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to identify it as a
harmful bacteria or a bacteria that uses
[SPEAKER_01]: those mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's total aerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to negatively affect
a lot of the terroir because you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: near that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those microbes that create those terpene
precursors in the root systems are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be essentially having to be scrubbed
out of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise they'll naturally show up in
these total aerobic plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, Washington in the first two
years, the legalization took a
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative approach, put that zero
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Oregon didn't require microbial
testing the first year or two and then
[SPEAKER_01]: did, but they set it kind of a lower bar
and a really, really tight bar on
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what ended up happening with Washington
is they didn't require a lot of testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and then slowly started requiring more and
more testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's required everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 18, I know it's required in
California, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's required everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado is like just came on board or is
about to maybe hasn't even on pesticide
[SPEAKER_03]: testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of a regulated market that
doesn't require it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado or just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Washington didn't require it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just they say that they will test
random samples and if you fail,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get a recall or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, California is interesting because
California has a remediation pathway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if stuff fails, it can be remediated
and still be in the metric system,
[SPEAKER_06]: the tag system or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, well, here's the thing with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to say that it's a good way to
save the farmer's crop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I've seen happen in some
parts of the country that are close to
[SPEAKER_01]: orchards or close to vineyards,
you're getting crop drift and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: failing for crop pesticides that you
didn't yourself spray for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other cases, it may be emulated from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Future 4200 readership, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: All those folks who were able to save all
that distillate by doing a fluorosilic
[SPEAKER_06]: chromatography or whatever it was that
they did to get rid of the Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sand scrub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a scrub.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sand, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was sand scrub.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a catchy tagline, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: For a business, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to carbon chemistries, right,
Dustin?
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to carbon, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to sell stuff to the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure there's going to be patents
that could develop out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, I do think that part of
what's called media bid filtration is
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used it prior to getting into the
cannabis industry when I was working in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bio industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you all know in our industry,
Murphy Murray, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Murphy, who does her CRC classes
in mass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I first met her on the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought there was something kind
of interesting going on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very interesting to use that as a
sort of little widespread technique,
[SPEAKER_06]: no matter whether your stuff's
contaminated or not to just get a more
[SPEAKER_06]: pure fraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always thought that for the most
part, you want to get as full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_06]: an extract as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fractionating it into these very nice
looking product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, has its place, but not I've been in
her personal lab and she has taken that to
[SPEAKER_03]: full circle background to the highest
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only does she have like a six foot
chroma column that she uses separation
[SPEAKER_03]: column that again, she fills with dirt,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sand and dirt, basically, like you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she also has a very nice
hydrocarbon falling film, which allows her
[SPEAKER_03]: to selectively change the temperature off
what you know, which fraction she takes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which she's covering.
[SPEAKER_03]: She then takes all of the choice fractions
and blends them back together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it allows her to separate out parts
that you wouldn't want to probably smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly not at, you know, definitely not
at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very interesting what she's
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's she's been isolating lately esters.
[SPEAKER_03]: She found that she's got one a jar full of
it and it's crystallizing on its own and
[SPEAKER_03]: it smells like bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the craziest thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first thing she showed me
when I was in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: She also has lots of blue crystals
growing, blue terpene crystals growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say amyl acetate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that the banana, the banana ester?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking online.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just remembering off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say amyl acetate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody check me on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting these things tested is a bit
tricky and or very expensive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your normal cannabis lab is not going
to be able to tell you what your ester is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be able to get you out of the
right path.
[SPEAKER_06]: But back to Marcus's terminology that all
these things are kind of like all like
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes you have to remediate shit
because you got pesticides in it and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't make a sellable product until you
remediate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other times you're looking to not
remediate, but you're looking to what you
[SPEAKER_06]: were saying, Dustin, fractionate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whether you fractionate by,
again, that sounds badass to have a
[SPEAKER_06]: following film evaporator where you can
separate different fractions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she's in a very good position.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the guys that she works with to
enable her to be able to do that kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: work and R&D.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, when we make water hash,
we're fractionating in a sense as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excluding things by particulate size
and we want some things to go through the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag and some things to stay on the other
side of the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we're just taking that further
down the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when when we smoke based on the
temperature, that's how much of whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: is in there is getting into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of fractionating it right
there, too, based on the vapor pressure or
[SPEAKER_03]: the vaporization point of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of our interaction, other than
just like straight up eating the flour,
[SPEAKER_03]: is some form of us selectively getting
down the line past the flour to the active
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of isomerization,
but a lot of decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I recommend closing acid chemistry
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recommend eating a piece of the bud that
you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it does release a whole like the
magic terpene in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, by smoking it,
sensation is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely be down to like soak a
bunch of buds in butter and then bake them
[SPEAKER_03]: for a little while and then eat that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, just putting a bud in a fresh bud
into hot water like a tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, everyone has heard about
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the terpenes in the water are just
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's heard of it here in Canada,
especially because that was one of Kirk
[SPEAKER_05]: Tussaud's main arguments when he explained
to the judge, as it sits right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: this cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if like your grandmother like
took it and put it in a teabag and put it
[SPEAKER_05]: into hot water, now she can face 14 years
in prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the judge was kind of like that was it
for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just like, yeah, we have to allow
extracts like there's there's just no
[SPEAKER_05]: there's not going to be any way around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just like that, just in B.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: at first across Canada, we went from
having, you know, no ability to do
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts to kind of overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly, you know, extracts were allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then and then they also redefined the
word marijuana, which was like marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: meant just the plant, you know,
the flowers or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the judge was like, no, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how we got extracts to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said marijuana is every component of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a license and you can have
like a pound, then you're allowed to have
[SPEAKER_05]: a pound of any part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was the game changer here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shut up.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had always heard about, you know,
being put in your tea, mom's tea,
[SPEAKER_11]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we always used to kind of laugh at
the idea because it was never the thought
[SPEAKER_11]: of I'm going to take a fresh bud and put
it in this tea and let its terpenes
[SPEAKER_11]: dissolve.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't even know what terpenes were in
the sense of what we're actually
[SPEAKER_11]: ingesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to think of then just putting a
flower in boiling water just seemed ant
[SPEAKER_11]: antithesis of anything that we're trying
to do to, quote unquote, get his eye.
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, leave it to older
generations to know there was something
[SPEAKER_11]: there and that science has caught up to
his understanding about the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_11]: all that that actually does come out in
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't necessarily get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are certainly soluble,
but cannabinoids are in their acid forms
[SPEAKER_00]: are not particularly water soluble at all,
even in hot water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamaican grandmothers, you know,
have been doing this from like for a very
[SPEAKER_05]: long time, like even while they're kind of
like harshing on the grandkids for smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: spliffs in the back room when their backs
are sore or previously lead to that to
[SPEAKER_05]: have like cramps from their periods or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there were mothers using this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like kind of the ancient medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can't help but wonder is if
they could have somehow tested the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: before the grandma made her tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after she made her tea and dried it
and seen what was the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if I'm getting the turps out
of the trikes because the water's so hot,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in theory, I'm probably
dissolving a lot of the trikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoids may not be soluble in the
water, but if I drink all of that water,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get all those cannabinoids
inside of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what do they float on the top?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they're just floating around
there instead of mixed into the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I drink it all and get that top layer
down, down the gut, I'm getting those
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabinoids inside of me for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so sure about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you actually tested that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could definitely stick to the rim of
the cup, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it was on the top, if I boiled it
and used a straw and sucked it up or just
[SPEAKER_03]: put my lips down on the top of the cup,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucked it out of the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the compelling nature?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so if you're just putting cannabis
into a tea bag and you drop the tea bag in
[SPEAKER_06]: the hot water, like Sam said, the
cannabinoids aren't going to be soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, very slightly soluble.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on how long you leave it in the
hot water for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on how tenacious you are,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this boiling water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're above or below the melting point
of the cannabinoids, they should melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes are going to help co-solvate
the trichomes, but it's going to form a
[SPEAKER_01]: biofilm on the surface.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to drink boiling hot water?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoids are still going to be
there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoids aren't going back to the
flower when it cools down.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to leave a sticky film
all over the place, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is, they're not going to be on
the bud anymore, is my argument.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So utilizing an animal milk like is used
in bang, that's a homogenizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, no, that's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a... Do it in milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, I've been prescribing tea to my
patients for a really long time,
[SPEAKER_08]: just putting flowers in tea and you can
ask all them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also... No, we're not saying it
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it from many, many people,
but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is what percentage of the
active ingredient is being delivered to
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient and what percent is left in
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my only question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have enough scientists here that
can actually just boil some cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: figure out what's left.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on, enough of y'all know how
to work.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has chromatography.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to emulsify.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need something to emulsify the fats
into the water layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about this many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not anything that's easily done
with just plant material and water.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you put plant fat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goat butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they put the goat butter in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, there's a fat in there too.
[SPEAKER_11]: In prison, they use Reese's peanut butter
cups because they have soy leethin in the
[SPEAKER_11]: peanut butter cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they would actually chew up their last
bud and then chew it with a peanut butter
[SPEAKER_11]: cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would break down because nobody
wants to smoke their last bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, that's why I was worried so much for
those peanut butter cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who's gal there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I can hash from ice water and I
should be able to make hash from hot water
[SPEAKER_03]: where I just agitated the shit out of it
and use it to, if I pressure wash with hot
[SPEAKER_03]: water, a bud, a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, how much research have you
done on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I actually took water hash
and put it in a tall, tall, large glass
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And poured boiling hot water in it to see
what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I've been playing around doing
this R.D.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: on campus a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still curious what I did ask
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had lots of starting material to
experiment with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was legal to do the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once that beaker cooled down, you could
drink it and that hash is getting inside
[SPEAKER_03]: of you, whether it's soluble in the water
or not, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's still in the beaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not very soluble in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this particular case, what did
happen was the hot water would cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: massive bubble hash to sink down to the
bottom of the container where it would get
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotter and it would bubble back up like a
lava lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would spread on the top, cool off and
sink back down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it did is gave me a few hours of
mindless fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of more passive
medicine, a little bit more homeopathic.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, a person that's making
ganja tea is probably a farmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I wouldn't say that someone's
going to go to the store in Canada and buy
[SPEAKER_07]: legal Canadian cannabis weed and go home
and make ganja tea and heal their ales.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the idea is that you are living
and breathing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing ganja tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone knows that oils and those kinds
of things dissolve the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you really want to dissolve the
trichomes, you might have like the butter
[SPEAKER_07]: and the things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you make tea, you know,
you might, if you really want the
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine, you probably eat the bud
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't use a tea bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you eat the bud afterwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when you make garden tea,
like we have products that are,
[SPEAKER_07]: that are, you know, we don't recommend
people using a bag to brew their tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: The water should go in you along with all
the worm castings and all the herbs should
[SPEAKER_07]: be in your body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water extraction from a plant is not the
same as water extraction from an extract
[SPEAKER_03]: because the plant has much more lipids
present.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm heating those lipids off the
plant surface up and then the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: floating around, I've got a little bit of
a lipid emulsion going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what winterization is
when we're processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all these extra lipids that we
extracted that we're trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those lipids are very cannabis soluble.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people lose a lot of their
cannabinoids to that fat cake that they've
[SPEAKER_03]: got because they didn't wash them back
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can, and you can load those lipids
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's all coming from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a hot water plant extraction has some
tiny percentage of cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming soluble just from the,
what's going on with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree with this because when I've
interviewed people in traditional cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: producing countries where men and
especially women would make tea as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, and they would say,
you know, that it gave them this benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: or that benefit or this benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just wondering if anybody
actually knew how much of the THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids or terpenes,
I imagine most of the terpenes are gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: still remain in the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like conventional tea or Camille
senesis or whatever it is, those are all
[SPEAKER_06]: water soluble polyphenols that are
actually the polyphenol portion is the
[SPEAKER_06]: aglazol.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the aglycone of a much larger
molecule that looks kind of like the
[SPEAKER_06]: anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are very large water soluble
molecules that come out in the tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and so that's, you know,
cannabinoids aren't aglycones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not, they're fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuck in the tricone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to easily solubilize it
in hot water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always found it interesting though,
and Sam, I don't know if you've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: looked at this before.
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears as though there's a good
process that uses hot water to do
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and almost kind of like, I won't say
it's like ice water hashing, but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: hashing in a way using hot water or super
pressurized steam or dust.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if you know about this at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find a reference or,
and I think Dustin's about to tell us
[SPEAKER_06]: about it, but they make a pretty high
percentage CBDA product from hemp now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen this coming out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dustin, do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: About that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, science is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is hash church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that, put that lava lamp image back in
your mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then imagine that I can wash through
that lava lamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can send a different solvent down that
will allow me to grab the hash and leave
[SPEAKER_03]: the water behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like typically in, in, in like your
cooking oil industry, that's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: hexane.
[SPEAKER_03]: But guys are getting crazy with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like percolating propane through
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, and you know, and the beauty
there is that the propane can then be
[SPEAKER_03]: separated from your hash at a very low
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm trying to save all my acids and
whatever non-water soluble terpenes that
[SPEAKER_03]: might be left, they're getting crazy with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a liquid liquid extraction
from the surface of the water.
And that's what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to get this glob
that's in your water and the hot water,
[SPEAKER_03]: the pressure water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a brick that trikes off and
get it, get it in the mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, again, some hybrid of that
process to me sounds pretty scalable,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it sounds like something that you'd
want to have really good regulation around
[SPEAKER_06]: the equipment and the process and the
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just like when I look at the size of.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tanks at Marcus's facility,
I can imagine that that process being
[SPEAKER_06]: carried out at that, at that tremendous
scale there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, there's a, that makes a very clean
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was amazed how clean the product is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know the level of detail about
the process that you just described.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a few more that are floating
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is like an acidic wash where
it's just warm acid and you're just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's very low.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acidic that's a lot more viscous and then
the other one is the.
[SPEAKER_03]: down the trichrome surfaces, and then
that's allowing the cannabinoids and turps
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything in there to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we said, they pop to the top and
then become a lava lamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, if you want to stay
truly solvent-less, there's ways to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the water off without any solvents,
but you're leaving a purity step behind
[SPEAKER_03]: when you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be beneficial or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we got to ask, and the rest of the
church wants to know from Sam,
[SPEAKER_06]: did you patent the hash lava lamp?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a fucking statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have enough hash to fill a lava
lamp, you got lots of hash, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I couldn't patent it, but to be
honest, I was thinking, well, how am I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever going to sell these when cannabis
wasn't even legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I didn't do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have made my retirement much more
plush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I'll guarantee you, I guarantee you
this, that most people's hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: it wouldn't work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yours worked because of the utter and
complete ridiculous quality and purity
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can get it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, I just doubt that every resin
would do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what you have the no green line at
the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could use this episode alone just to
blow it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone needs to invent the hash lava
lamp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have really good, clean water hash,
you can easily do it also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it has to be really clean
and really good because clean is not so
[SPEAKER_05]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be some people with an extra
ounce of water hash policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a gallon of dried weight
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Dustin, some of your trials got
to be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of gallons of boiling water on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of good laughs today on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to call a hard stop at 12 PM.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have like three minutes to wrap it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can continue next weekend for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyone that wants to say more now,
this is your chance and I'll thank you
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dustin, for coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have you back again as well if you
want to come share some more and thank
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone for being on the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's finish it off here with our last
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say whatever you need to say, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great having you here, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you know, some of your tribe,
I joined your future 4200 there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fascinating site.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's got to be some people there
that in your network there that at least
[SPEAKER_11]: should have been piqued by this discussion
and hopefully we'll start to see some
[SPEAKER_11]: prototypes in the coming weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, people, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the techniques are on Hash Church,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked about it enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, I'm a member of future 4200.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of good information out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you wade through the threads,
man, and there's just discussions where
[SPEAKER_06]: you can get lost for hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming out today, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one about us talking on Hash
Church right now that I just found from
[SPEAKER_05]: Pharmax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like the fourth post I found.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's meta as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a picture of Dustin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like this has been before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has happened many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that there's lots of
familiar people in both circles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I knew at least three of you guys
before this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hung out with the Dragonfly guy in
Hawaii last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, I think maybe at Liv, hanging out
with Tim.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've met somewhere before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horatio pretty well, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Horatio, I did know Horatio pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about you quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on your forum, and I read a lot
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great to see everybody here today,
and always thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody has a fantastic Sunday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep that positivity going and
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to challenge you guys all to a solo
cup grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want everybody to grow a plant in a solo
cup all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a chance, grab a solo cup and
just grow on a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it in your window, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just grow a solo cup and maybe even pass
that on to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep them growing their journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, guys, peace and love,
and thanks for having me, Mark,
[SPEAKER_04]: and everybody else on the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad I took my plant out of the solo
cup, but it's doing so much better in a
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the animal cookies,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you want to maintain it as a
bonsai, just remember, you just take it
[SPEAKER_11]: out, remove the bottom third, and then put
in new soil, and then you can put it back.
[SPEAKER_11]: It keeps the roots growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, you'll get root log.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonsai tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I must be a new member or
something because my shit needs approval
[SPEAKER_05]: on future 4200.
[SPEAKER_05]: If only I knew the guy that owned the
website or something, I could maybe get a
[SPEAKER_05]: little boost on my... No, no, I'm just...
A little juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody, for coming and
hanging out, and I hope you guys all have
[SPEAKER_05]: a really nice Sunday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try and do it again next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send out the emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to come back,
we'll talk some more, and otherwise,
[SPEAKER_05]: may that full melt bless your bowl sooner
than laters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just no mushrooms into your diet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
