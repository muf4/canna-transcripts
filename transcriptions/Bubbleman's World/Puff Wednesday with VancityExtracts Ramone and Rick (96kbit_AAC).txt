[SPEAKER_02]: I get to sit in the middle this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: These bitches had me on the side last
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was their side bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got that, which is good to have nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the delimiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can pull that out later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Horatio's though, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put it on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a lovely Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just filmed an almost four hour hash
church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here with the good guys over at
Van City Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just met Matthew not too many days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the gentleman that came up to D420K
and I and sort of blew us away with this
[SPEAKER_02]: really beautiful quality dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we've also met Ali, who's doing
some of the dry sifting with Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, man, hats off to both of you guys,
dude, because this is quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are obviously taking care of
growing proper plants or accessing proper
[SPEAKER_02]: gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because decontaminating is only one part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure Ramon, you can attest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaning is one part, but you don't always
get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the hardest part really is whether
you're going through a grower yourself is
[SPEAKER_00]: really to either find the person that
knows the plant that well or either know
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that well yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to do with different
strains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can really find a strain that
you're able to train and work with and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce those resinous heads, you can keep
doing it over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the key for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people haven't quite figured that
out, that they need this super important
[SPEAKER_02]: factor is having a great grower,
but also in choosing great genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of these, you should walk us
through a little bit of what you got going
[SPEAKER_02]: on and feel free to hold it up and show
the camera whenever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a beautiful piece of flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what strain is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strain was it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was an Obi-Wan crossed with
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah yeah, you guys showed me a bud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obi-Wan Skywalker, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obi-Wan Skywalker, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really kushed out and super
nuggety and chunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the dry sift, we have some
headband kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift that looks like flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clarity counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some Muerte that won the first
place solvent list.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is G&E, Great Northern Extraction
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my favorite so far, Candy Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that started this meeting up,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the dry sift that Matt came up to
Dee and I at the CCHQ and offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when he came up, I swear it was
this reminiscent thing where I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh my god, this guy is for sure going to
give me an oil slab right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it happens to me a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is weird because you think people
would know that I'm not really a big oil
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when he came over and I was like,
oh my god, this guy is going to give me
[SPEAKER_02]: oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I want you to have this dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, did he just say dry sift?
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell and the quality, I was like,
all right, sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've literally been setting this up
for the last half an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had any puffs since Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's time to hit some of these
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one do you guys want to try first?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're going to open it up with the
best, the starter, the one that smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like a half pound of wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start off with the candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when I'm decontaminated to 99%
gland heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when the gland heads have been
grown to perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at that point, I love a strong
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that this particular Candy Kush
Dry Sift has all three of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing I've realized with this
Candy Kush Dry Sift is with other strains
[SPEAKER_03]: when we were sifting it, throughout the
whole process, your nose kind of gets used
[SPEAKER_03]: to the smell, used to the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of stopped smelling it after about
a couple of hours in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with this Candy Kush, it didn't matter
how long you were in the room with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: how close you were to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could smell it the exact same the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saturated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saturated my nose, saturated my taste
buds even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I hit it, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's got great texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even the way it's picking up off
the parchment, the way he's just cut the
[SPEAKER_02]: dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really, really nice hash,
and we're happy that... What's the first
[SPEAKER_02]: half?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to Rick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy that Van City Extracts is
deciding that a quiver beats a single
[SPEAKER_02]: one-trip poem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to expand your horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole reason why we're into cannabis
in the first place is because of its
[SPEAKER_00]: medical quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really passionate about it,
you'll take the time to study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take the time to learn to plant how
the plant can benefit you and what it can
[SPEAKER_00]: do for you, how it can help your every
single day life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% gonna gear up for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit a little hit through the sick,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got that all on, yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 723 and 749, for those of you wondering at
what temperatures our D-nails are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sick is a unique head on a nail in the
sense that... You can turn this thing up
[SPEAKER_02]: to 800, and it's still gonna hit more like
a low-temp dab off of titanium quartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silicon carbide is a high-end ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a little bit different from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can't get this in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice big old silicon carbide rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy to see the youth picking up the
torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to see the pioneers enjoy what
we're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows us away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for you guys in the first
place, we wouldn't even be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: close to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that much information out
there readily available to the public that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can know while watching that it's 100%
accurate.
True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that you get on the internet is
pretty much just half and half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like looking for a needle in a
haystack sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's good information out there,
but it's literally floating in a cesspool
[SPEAKER_02]: of disinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: David Suzuki had a brilliant quote years
ago when he talked about his show,
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nature of Things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a PBS show, really incredible
nature show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really thought he was going to change
the world with this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I seen him speak one time and he said,
I quickly realized when you jump into a
[SPEAKER_02]: cesspool that you take on the appearance
of everything in the cesspool,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you are yourself a gem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the internet has a little bit of that
problem in the sense that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of bullshit and a lot of
crap to sort of filter through.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people who maybe aren't as
passionate about this particular topic as
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves they might have an even harder
time distinguishing the real from the
[SPEAKER_02]: false.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we love Hash Church and we
really respect the people on there because
[SPEAKER_03]: we know everyone's speaking out of the
kindness of their hearts to help better
[SPEAKER_03]: the community, help better all the
processes we have going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well I'm glad to hear you say that
because that's really what Hash Church is
[SPEAKER_02]: all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about creating a dialogue,
sharing information with people so that
[SPEAKER_02]: just getting rid of this fear and scarcity
that there's not enough for you and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not enough for me and sort of
putting more of a love and abundance vibe
[SPEAKER_02]: into the air where it's like, hey guess
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's not enough pie on the table,
we can go bake another pie.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Job made enough for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to go around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rastafarian friends say all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That resonates with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that job made enough for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not necessarily a religious person but
I like the aspect, the spirituality aspect
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the helping aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, some of the stories
in Hash Church today were really powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colton and his mother Wendy coming in and
sharing their story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real true value and I always bring
that value back to this because people
[SPEAKER_02]: like to distinguish the two and they say,
well, okay, yeah, that's legitimate,
[SPEAKER_02]: a child who needs medicine, but you guys
are just a bunch of stoners sitting around
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you call, okay, well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Colton learned about this
plant from people like us and how we
[SPEAKER_02]: learned about this plant was not from
going to university courses or reading
[SPEAKER_02]: about different aspects of this in
textbooks, but we learned about it from
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaling phytocannabinoids, from consuming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we learned about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we better understand and learn
about this plant by the relationship that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have not only with growing it and
processing it, but then taking what we
[SPEAKER_02]: process, putting it inside our bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: People may look at us like a bunch of
stoners, but me personally, cannabis saved
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to take multiple Oxycontins every
day because of my herniated disc in my
[SPEAKER_03]: back after my car accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy right here showed me the beauty
of extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the reason I got off opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big deal for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a zombie at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, they're doing this to the youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: These pharmaceutical companies are doing
this to young kids and getting them hooked
[SPEAKER_02]: onto this.
[SPEAKER_02]: 19 years old at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxycontins are fucking hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: What more of a hardcore pill could he have
said that he was taking?
[SPEAKER_03]: What 20-year-old man needs to take an
80-milligram Oxycontin?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's straight hillbilly piece like
heroin.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the world we live in, with the
experiences you go through and everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: usually somebody by the time they're even
that age, that drug will do more than just
[SPEAKER_04]: relieve that pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will do a lot of things in their brain
and relieve other pains that they need to
[SPEAKER_04]: be the person they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's some weird shit,
those pharmaceutical pills, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing, those pills kind of take
you away from who you are and make you a
[SPEAKER_00]: zombie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob Marley even said, when you smoke
the herb it reveals it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the complete opposite and that's why
the Pharmaceutical Company doesn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: weed to be available readily to the
public.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take it to the next level and even say
that it not only reveals you to yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it reveals it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really unveils the potential offerings
that cannabis truly has, not only from an
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial standpoint and the many
thousands of commercial products that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be made from hemp, from a health
standpoint of crushing the seed oil and
[SPEAKER_02]: acquiring all 11 essential amino acids
that the body needs but can't produce,
[SPEAKER_02]: including the three that children need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's 11, nine for adults,
three more for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it also produces these
phytocannabinoids that are like the
[SPEAKER_02]: essential life fuel or essence for every
cell in our body to communicate healthily
[SPEAKER_02]: back and forth to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: In able to put our central nervous system
and our immune system into homeostasis,
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system requires
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that right there is an incredible
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's a coincidence that the
level of the bar that we set as
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseurs, as people that love to
inhale this plant, both represent
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational and medicinal and even albeit
preventatively, that it somehow coincides
[SPEAKER_02]: with us having the most valid information
to help people that need this plant for
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the pharmaceutical companies,
they're like, we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll test it in a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're testing it on ourselves through
bioassay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taking it and it's so
instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to deny someone with
glaucoma with an intense ocular pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: having a quick puff out of a pipe or off
of a spliff and releasing that ocular
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure in an instant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really doesn't matter how much you
think you know or if you have a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: degree, you're going to have a hard time
convincing that person that what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing isn't good, isn't right for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting discussion,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It excites me and so does puffing more of
that dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: My 67-year-old father, man, he gave him
one dab of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't take his pills for an entire
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's over 20 pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to take a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all 20 of those pills are slowly
trying to, what they're doing is a bad job
[SPEAKER_02]: of trying to do the job of what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The natural signallers are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are artificial... Low-quality
imitation basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low-quality imitation that produces all
sorts of adverse side effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: costs untold amounts of pain and suffering
and costs enormous amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxes, people's paychecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't cost a lot of money to
the government and the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: company, but it costs a lot of money to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As herb, herb shouldn't really cost as
much as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing that I really was
hoping when the dab era came around was
[SPEAKER_00]: that the price of flowers would go down a
little bit and the price of extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be priced as outrageously as they
argued it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are charging 150 to 200 bucks
a gram and they're preaching it for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really personally don't know many
medical patients that could afford that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's insane and it's unfortunate that
the prohibition dollar went from
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition went from, well, you could
serve your life in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what the value was put upon
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can go to jail for a long time,
well, then you can get a lot of money for
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds in that particular place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that prohibition dollar,
as it slowly turned into the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar, it just never changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just didn't change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, it did for a short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was herb dropped through the
floor, both here in Canada, California,
[SPEAKER_02]: the West Coast, even in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were able to buy pounds for thousands
of dollars cheaper than ever before
[SPEAKER_02]: because so many pounds were starting to
gather in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to send them all over the
US surplus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, surplus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Canada stopped sending pounds down to
the US because they started growing so
[SPEAKER_02]: much and having such a surplus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really changed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until people started,
how people really accessed the prohibition
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar that was slowly getting lost was
through oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to blast pounds and get
that dollar back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden it's like,
oh, I'm getting like this many thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: of dollars for a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I make shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this whole new like, it's one of
the things that I stayed away from the oil
[SPEAKER_02]: scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really Horatio brought me back
considering an oil product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so did rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is the rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right here in front of me,
just coincidentally enough is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, beautiful flower rosin that is
an oil, as well as a delimiting extract
[SPEAKER_02]: from Horatio, which is an oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't scare me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that even if a mistake was made,
there's not going to be something left in
[SPEAKER_02]: here that can cause me adverse,
you know, there's no footprint from an
[SPEAKER_02]: outside source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, particularly a chemical hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just afraid of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm not to say that chemists
couldn't learn the process and do an
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional job in a laboratory with lab
grade materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee that can and should exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just say that, um, more people like your
guys itself should be focused on things
[SPEAKER_02]: like this that are, that give you a
greater room for mistake for error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because hydrocarbon is a cruel bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dangerous gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way, the way that we really
like to look at the whole, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hydrocarbon extract era,
if you will, is there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second of all, a lot of patients are
smoking barbecue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking garbage stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really feel as, because I mean,
a lot of people obviously believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: their own extract is, I don't want to
necessarily say the best, but the safest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're like, Oh, I know my
stuff is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we really started our
company, we made extract for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never really wanted to go into this and
go into dispensary, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: around us were saying we've never tried
extract like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's actually different than the
stuff we've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I've tried oil for my first
time, brought it to Eden, medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: society, and they just, they went crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd never really seen anything like it
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like we almost, I don't really want
to say if you feel as if it's our duty to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply the city with good medicine,
but I just feel a little bit more better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obliged to do so because I see the garbage
that's out there and there's nothing I can
[SPEAKER_00]: really do except for produce my own safe
hydrocarbon extract and let the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get their hands on it for the
best price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try running all sorts of material so
that anybody with any price budget will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to afford extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody wants to pay 80,
90, a hundred bucks a gram for a shatter
[SPEAKER_00]: or butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many patients can, if you have a very
debilitating physical disability and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't work eight hours a day, you are
really a physical, like you're a patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you going to afford $200 a gram?
[SPEAKER_03]: When your disability check is 900 for a
gram a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, not everyone is
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people really need to consume this
orally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those people to consume something
now, comparing it to pharmaceutical drugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're still more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are pills that cost $80 a pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are pills that cost $150 a pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's just not really,
doesn't seem to be the cannabis way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think cannabis is just for
millionaires that can afford hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in India, cannabis is known as the
poor man's drug and it's available to
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter who you are or what
class you're from, how high up you are or
[SPEAKER_02]: how low you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to access cannabis
because it grows in the ditches,
[SPEAKER_02]: it grows in the mountains and it's
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's always how I've seen
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's why the agenda is so
threatened by it and why they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, nobody can have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in reality, this is what they
don't want you guys to know, so pay
[SPEAKER_02]: attention here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's everywhere on all four corners of
the planet, which is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't really be said for too many other
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter where you're watching from
and all the different 208 countries,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's currently how many
different people, how many different
[SPEAKER_02]: countries watch bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: 208 countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's people tuning in from all these
different countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on your laws, you know,
I don't urge you to go out and get
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself arrested or in trouble,
but I definitely urge you, cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed where you live and you want to be
a part of and have cannabis in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you either need to a make things
happen in the safest, most efficient way
[SPEAKER_02]: for you or you need to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the thing that always blew me
away is the fact that we're sitting right
[SPEAKER_00]: here smoking comfortably in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people on the same planet
somewhere getting beaten for smoking my
[SPEAKER_00]: police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting thrown in jail for
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just really bothers me that we're
all living on the same planet yet
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere has a different, you know,
I understand there's different cultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's different ways about doing things,
but we're all like, we're human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to be logical about things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like there should be almost the
way physics has laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be common sense laws that
it's like, okay, we respect your belief
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause one of the things I appreciated
about traveling in India is that India
[SPEAKER_02]: respects all the belief systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can hang out with a Shevite and
you can hang out with a Krishna and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different belief systems
in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they all believe deep down that no
matter what you believe, it's what they
[SPEAKER_02]: believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just through a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you won't see it the same way,
but it's just kind of a known thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, listen, it's, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come from here, we go to there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have these sort of standards and
there should be sort of common sense
[SPEAKER_02]: standards, like physical laws that no
matter what your belief system or culture
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you shouldn't be allowed to execute
people for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't be allowed to put people in
a cage for 30 years of their life for a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just really shouldn't even,
I can't even believe that people are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a ticketable, it's a ticketable
offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we fought for a ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: A ticket?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: No ticketable offense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working out like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what the point I was
trying to bring up at CCSQ is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, the pioneers, made that possible for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're sitting here as a younger
generation saying, holy crap, we're only
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a ticket for weed while you guys
are actually fought for the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't really see the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing up as you guys were
fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that all came along and where
we're at now, it's completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: than what you guys wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but that's the plan, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You always want the youth to not have to
go through what you went through,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly in this particular fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just keep always going back to
Rick's dad, like he's sitting in prison
[SPEAKER_02]: for 27 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't really wrap my head around
that, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were my son's age when that shit
happened to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's devastating.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is like criminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kidnapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even worse than kidnapping,
it's like murder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking a father away from his child for a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have a puff in honor of your father.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good time to tell him,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't even been mentioning shit
about, about the, you know, let them know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what you can do is go to it's free
to lacy.com and sign a petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you support, just read the site and
you'll see what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: My father's been locked up in prison since
1989.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually he's been in prison since 88,
but was sentenced in 89.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strictly a cannabis smuggling charge,
which they then turned into a RICO charge
[SPEAKER_04]: and turned into a 98 year charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's been in ever since.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, the only thing we can really do
is at this point right now is sign a
[SPEAKER_04]: petition and raise awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have some attorney things going on at
the moment, so I'll let, I'll let
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody know more once that's
solidified, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll be going to see my pops in three
weeks and then I'll even know more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just a trip, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to share this world with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bugged out just to be, cause I just
went from Frisco and there it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is pretty much tolerated and legal to
some perspective medically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then go to Colorado where there's,
where there's a breast one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to Seattle and then here,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see all these different,
that it's actually possible and then think
[SPEAKER_04]: like, yeah, well possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I live in Amsterdam where it's like
you can go downstairs and buy the shit.
You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing, the government,
they like to make an example out of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they go out of their way to do so and
they even break the law to do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's beyond an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's like retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my dad doesn't need to die and pray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's what you guys can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread the word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow FridaLisi and go to FridaLisi.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to mute my mic while I
was coughing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still stuck in a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with you guys, like quality guys
inviting us over to like lay out this
[SPEAKER_02]: superb dry sift and rosin with the
motherships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to be in this neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go to this side too often,
but it's nice in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the trees and it's just a real nice
kind of quiet, raise your family kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very mellow area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is this some of the nicest dry sift
you guys have seen since you've been in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Represent.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you're saving the day here guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had the best dry sift to show
these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, since- And smoked mine like a
fiend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we've really started making dry
sift, we've never really smoked anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else's but our own, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always thought it mellowed it's good,
it notes, it's good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I saw Bubble Man's reaction and
Darren's reaction, I was like shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, a couple of the people
on Hasbro, it's the way that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, reacted to what I was
doing, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it is, it's like this,
and Ramon was in the same boat and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: like more and more people stepping up to
this plate and I think they think that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, it should, it's like a rare
position, but really it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are just the first ones out of
many to come to realize there's simple
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pay attention to the resin,
somehow it just ends up being better than
[SPEAKER_02]: if you don't pay attention to the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing for vegetative yields
and flowering periods and how much can I
[SPEAKER_02]: get and how fast can I get it,
it just is never going to turn out the
[SPEAKER_02]: same as like, no man, we're going to dry
sift all this shit and when we do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has to be grown this particular way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've learned from mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a different focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have that focus, you end up with
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more and more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year since we started Legends,
more and more people come to the plate and
[SPEAKER_02]: when you make the best, the best is the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to take the proper steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the proper steps start with growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who can control their resin are
the people who can grow their resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I've noticed in this
industry, in this community, the people
[SPEAKER_02]: who seemingly have the best sort of
quality resin are people who have a say in
[SPEAKER_00]: how that resin is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what's required in order
to do your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a spiritual journey in
itself, you know, understanding the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not like you can just go to
school, read books and find out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know the basics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until you really put your heart and
soul into it, it won't speak back to you.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of interaction going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We geek out on this shit, as you can see
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he came home that day after he saw
you at CCHU and he said you looked at the
[SPEAKER_03]: dry set the way you did, I almost fell out
of my chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe that something we
produced, just us two, would make you that
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the best is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter where you are or who made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like ego aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, that's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the best too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, he's got some too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be happy until everyone has it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All different flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are what he says to me every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says everybody deserves to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm more than a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am now cultivating hash makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And becoming a philanthropist for the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivating hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, whatever it takes,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see the industry showing
support back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I talk to a lot of older
people, just last month I had a meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: with some guy, he's in his 40s,
50s, and he was telling me, he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know just a couple weeks ago I threw
away my second phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I used to have a business phone
and a personal phone my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, we used to have to worry all
the time, check over our shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like, now the industry has been
so supportive that it's taking heat off of
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people because they're watching
everybody, not just certain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we stand together, they really
can't take a step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and when you realize that most
people in the cannabis industry aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: actual criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just been criminalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there's some interaction with when
you make something completely illicit,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's going to be an interaction with
the non and the actual elements of crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they do for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You give them, you fund them by
prohibiting certain drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make certain things illegal,
that funds organized crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have a lot less money if those
drugs that they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, you know, maybe they're
just businessmen that were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh well, if the drugs were legal,
we would be able to just do a sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: business model with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not one to pretend to know that
aspect, but it's interesting to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: far we've come compared to the heat that
once was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to hear that Buddy got to throw
a second phone call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's just too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially now that everybody's,
you know, a little too anal by radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything that comes off your phone
and your laptop, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be carrying 10 of them
in your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my phones is ringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, the good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a bag of phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a design that was going to be a
briefcase.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the bat, you crack it open and it could
be like five phones on this side,
[SPEAKER_02]: five phones on this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you close it, there would be
like a plug for you to put your headphone
[SPEAKER_02]: mouthpiece into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a little light to let you
know which one was ringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's proprietary information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some 96 shit right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have the whole belt full of
beepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't wear them on a belt, but I
definitely had a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've come a long way, but there's
still a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's definitely why we continue on
this mission of creating these dialogues
[SPEAKER_02]: and sharing information with people and
letting people know where they can find
[SPEAKER_02]: Van City extracts for people that want to
like follow you on Facebook or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have Facebook set up yet,
but we have Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow us at Van City extracts on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only dispenser that we're
currently at right now is the Eating
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every now and then we might have a drop of
like a special flavor or a variety at
[SPEAKER_00]: different dispensaries, but for the most
part, we're just eating exclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the dry sip doesn't leave in
the head stash, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I'm trying to get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't really into dry sip until I
showed it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have really showed it to him,
but he didn't really know his flour were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually producing those resins that were
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came back to him, he actually
wanted some himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm trying to, you know, get him on
the same level as I am with the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: patient need this medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please take it off the top before you do
anything else.
Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we would love to do is to be able
to give patients access to dry sift at an
[SPEAKER_03]: affordable cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't love that?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the quality that you would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can I say I would like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what we're trying to get
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, for the longest time, I've just been
trying to grow enough resin for myself to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a gram of it a day so I can consume
half of it orally and half of it through
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard even just to grow that small
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're running a business and being
a father and doing all the other things in
[SPEAKER_02]: life, it's not that easy to just grow 365
grams of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be a lot harder without the
sift, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure would be, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely glad to have my screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I never, ever promote my own shit,
but you can check these screens out that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all talking about at freshheadies
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your bottle back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get those for all that sort of resin
extraction tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely have you covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I like to think of is pretty good
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sense that even people for years
have been asking me how to do stuff with
[SPEAKER_02]: other people's products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been answering them and basically
doing customer service for like every
[SPEAKER_02]: other bag company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people who sell like a dry sift
box or any of those, people call me and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, okay, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need more than one screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Tia asked me on Hash Church if I only
had one screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the meme that got created?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like me smelling a bud and doing a
sativa plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, one screen, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any pantyhose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because pantyhose could be used as a
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: A single pharma grid screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you only were able to have one
screen, I think I'd grab the 70 and then
[SPEAKER_02]: just grab some pantyhose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Etienne was like, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well that's the hard part right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few other people asking me to
promote their dry sift methods and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: having a hard time doing it because A,
I haven't been able to find it efficient
[SPEAKER_02]: or really even work in the same way at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like especially for the decontamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's coming out with a better
decontamination method anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is like a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even carding was a game changer for
the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The patient person who was patient enough
to push all the contaminant through the
[SPEAKER_02]: card.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get 99% heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with Me's online on YouTube,
he wrapped parchment around the card and
[SPEAKER_02]: he found when he was doing it that it was
sticking to the parchment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then D420k wrapped it around a
thicker thing, a DVD case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really the game changer right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone had their place in that and
those guys should deserve their shout out
[SPEAKER_02]: for helping everyone along the way get to
what I like to call the unadulterated
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what dry sift is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the purest of the pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if you can master that one,
that's a good arrow to have in the quiver
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the other arrows in my opinion
line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean personally I couldn't really see
any other way to be able to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular heads without using any
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purely unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like intact.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With no water solubles taken like water
ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally really like the whole
circular profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think on that note we should thank
these guys from Ven City Extracts for
[SPEAKER_02]: having us come by and showing us such good
hospitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing us the superb sift and rosin and
yeah it won't be the last time you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: see these guys and thanks for watching
Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you soon.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just push that button on the back
of that camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And invite our friends into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody knows you never go hungry.
We ain't hungry.
We ain't hungry.
