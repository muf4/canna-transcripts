lineup and basically, I made it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: ferry first because I'm in the motorcycle
group they put you right to the top and
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the only reason I was able
to film this without a bunch of other

very I've I've been enjoying them for the
[SPEAKER_05]: last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never actually Gotten to use one of
your pieces, but I've definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: appreciated the art form and same with
Phil the little wizards I always stood out
[SPEAKER_05]: to me as just like those are quality
little pieces So I just wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys real quickly like how did the
collaboration come about with the three of

of us because he's been out to Germany
[SPEAKER_02]: before and roar is actually bringing us
out there and We're gonna be doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: work with roar before cultiva,
but I cultiva We're gonna do our demo
[SPEAKER_02]: there like a two-day one right in Vienna
October 12th and to the 14th But yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick's been out there before so he
invited us and Martin just kind of hit me
[SPEAKER_04]: up I needed some people to come and I was

them a bit of the sound here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard you guys saw some orcas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's funny I haven't seen whales in
like 15 years here and these guys show up
[SPEAKER_05]: first thing see whales Yeah, no,
that's just happening in my area as well
[SPEAKER_05]: of Lions Bay My brother-in-law was sitting
on the beach first time in years coming
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's just like oh look There's some
orcas going by the beach like we never see
[SPEAKER_05]: that Cool so you guys are working on a few
pieces here in Canada first and then
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna are you gonna use those
pieces as well as We kind of wanted to get
[SPEAKER_02]: together just to brainstorm what we were
gonna do at our demo since we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: in in Europe and we wanted to kind of
bring Have a game plan bring a game plan
[SPEAKER_02]: not just kind of wing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So We definitely spent a good amount of
time just like thinking and drawing up
[SPEAKER_02]: different designs and then Do as much work
as we could on those designs Because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to leave some work there for the
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Glass blowing is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just decided to make a few extra pieces
while we were hanging out So I guess
[SPEAKER_05]: because Martin is sort of holding down
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't have to bring too too much
equipment He's gonna supply the torches
[SPEAKER_04]: sponsored by Herbert Arnold torches A
whole bunch of gear to play with all brand
[SPEAKER_04]: new hand torches and it's probably 40 mil
Herbie's I think we're gonna be visiting
[SPEAKER_05]: the factory, which it was my next question
I was gonna say have you visited the
[SPEAKER_04]: Herbert Arnold factory guys to see the
golden Herbie's dude Listen, I walked
[SPEAKER_05]: through there with hops and Dizzle and
they were like kids in candy shops It was
[SPEAKER_04]: basically like visiting Willy Wonka's
chocolate factory for glassblowers Listen
[SPEAKER_05]: even for someone that just appreciates
glass myself who's never blown any glass
[SPEAKER_05]: that place is next Level it will blow your
mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the biggest lid I've ever seen there
before There's like water-cooled bed on it
[SPEAKER_04]: meant for holding tubing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like five six foot diameter How
about the wall of hand tools?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all those different hand tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to like pull me out of there We
had to pull hops and Dizzle out of there,
[SPEAKER_05]: too I need one of these and one of these
and one of these That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are gonna go check out the
factory you guys are gonna do this So one
[SPEAKER_05]: of those particular drawings that you
showed will probably be the project that
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys put together there Probably do
two pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe yeah, we're gonna try to get some
work done at Martin's place Awesome And
[SPEAKER_05]: then the glass pieces in the end where
where will those end up seeing their way
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll probably get bought up right there
go through Hopefully, I mean It's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: like a roar collapse I'm sure it'd be like
Whatever clients they have or any anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: who's out there, you know, but it could
make its way back to America It would be
[SPEAKER_02]: bad if it stayed out in Europe and then
people got to enjoy the glass out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely Well, it definitely just saw
some of the ideas that you guys were
[SPEAKER_05]: drawing up and it looked absolutely
