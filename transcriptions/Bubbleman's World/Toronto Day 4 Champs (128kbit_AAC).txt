[SPEAKER_15]: All right, day four.
[SPEAKER_15]: Day two of champs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Day two of champs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Day four of our adventure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Day four of us.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just woke up.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had our breakfast.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got some barb.
[SPEAKER_15]: We brought some barb.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to pay attention today to
how long this takes to grease up.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's powder right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_15]: And why don't we start, you want to do a
little dab of barb?
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's barb it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I got some My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this will be in the fridge too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just looking all nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to bring this down here and
puff with some people today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let's just have a quick puff right
here before we leave.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got our D now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got your scully tool right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to scully up a rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like powdering up here, but it's...
There's the old city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here's a nice little rip for
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny's ripping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny Ripper.
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny B Ripper.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Load me up one of those bad boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got this nice little cloth here to clean
it up right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, a little dab rag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to have a dab rag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you don't want to be putting in
the dirty scully tool into the barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you actually drive my dabber,
old friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Give you that morning wrap.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like going really heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a nice little morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you put the rest on?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, right on the end of the dabber.
[SPEAKER_15]: See the whole hit there?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, don't waste that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just push it into the bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just leave it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, new skills.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was moving it around so fast,
the hash was sticking to the dabber,
[SPEAKER_15]: and he literally left half the hit on the
dabber.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, oh, please, no,
I want that hit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, brother.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see you guys down there.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to head down to the booth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, it's open to the public today,
so we'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace for now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace for now.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so we're back here at the
Champs show.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just got to the booth, had a couple of
bros show up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's check out that Emmy pendant on
you there, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, that is sick.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just picked that up?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just picked it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what did you guys think of the Astro
Boy rip?
[SPEAKER_15]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Grown by me, processed by me and John.
[SPEAKER_15]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Puffed by these guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: John and Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_15]: John and Ryan in the house.
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so it's Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: John and Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: John and Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're about to do some hits of Barb.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're going to let us know what they
think of the Full Melt Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_14]: Barb, did you enter that in the cup?
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt did.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we definitely had some last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going through all the samples.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: I cleaned it up for him, so I think it was
more his entry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely a different experience when you
try these resins off an electric nail in
[SPEAKER_15]: the fourth bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: That Barb just melts away in the bowl,
turns gold in, and just gives the most
[SPEAKER_15]: unique flavor and taste.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for popping out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Wade didn't charge you, like they do
in the US.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: They did that very thing to me as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's this, the crazy train?
[SPEAKER_09]: They blow glass, and every time they add
something to that train, like this thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even the tower is glass, and the
figure standing around there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just blow and put things on the
train.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_15]: Best to have fun with it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_15]: Super stoked to bring you the owner of our
very good friend of mine, Martin Pierson.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's here at the Champ Show in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to see you, Martin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, good to see you, Martin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've known Martin for probably about 15
years, and I've always been a fan of Roar
[SPEAKER_15]: from day one, the glass on glass,
and the German precision blowing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And today we're here just talking a little
bit with Martin about what's new with
[SPEAKER_09]: Roar.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are, for example, those nice little
dampers we have here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that should pick up.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an opal in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an opal in the middle,
and we have new sections and different new
[SPEAKER_09]: experimental forms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, we're here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pleasure to be here in Canada all
these years and meet people like Martin.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to see you here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see you as often or usually in a
random show in Europe when I run into
[SPEAKER_15]: Martin.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you also have some new sections on some
of these pieces here?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And are these all inspired by some of the
glass?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some techniques, some colors are always
still in these artworks.
[SPEAKER_09]: We develop it a little bit and mix it with
the frame of the German glass doors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every year there's new colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all come from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: where we buy them, and also the opals and
the millings and stuff we use come all
[SPEAKER_09]: from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we try out as Martin, and the pieces
are very different in Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The serial production and the little bit
of artwork can be customized.
[SPEAKER_09]: Generally, we can customize our pipe with
a little crown, some colored ice pinches,
[SPEAKER_09]: different views.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way it was always set up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember the first time I looked through
the catalog, it was like this is like a
[SPEAKER_15]: car, like a base model car that you can
buy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you go through all the options
and choose the options that you want in
[SPEAKER_15]: your car.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you also have ruler tech that you
guys now have doing ruler in America?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is like the ruler tech.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the slogan is innovation meets
tradition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, I like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Innovation meets tradition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and this is about the preparation
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the classic worldwide, it's only the
diffuser as a percolation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here they have all kinds of tin home
trees and barrels and recyclers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the American flavor,
which is also not so big in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Europe, we have like the traditional
smoking machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see the dabbing culture
popularizing in Europe?
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit in certain countries,
certain events here, but it's still very
[SPEAKER_09]: small compared to here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know all the reasons, but we have
developed also some activities.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes people come into the shop
and say, hey, what is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can, nobody will ask you what is
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all know about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: How much is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not this availability from
titanium and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only rare places where people start
slowly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what do you think of all these
electric nails that are happening?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have an interest in, does Ruhr have
any interest in the electric nail market?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't handle this flame and the
propane gas, which can be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely perceived to be more
hardcore by regular people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's probably also more good for
medical patients and using it at home,
[SPEAKER_09]: very like cultural.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to look here, also get some
contacts probably to find out some meaning
[SPEAKER_09]: of this electric nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I just see it in the magazines
over the last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would suggest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see the first time working.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love mine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say I would suggest
getting in touch with the guys at D-Nail,
[SPEAKER_15]: Brian Shorter and Stevie Hughes.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not the first originators,
but they're definitely pioneering and
[SPEAKER_15]: pushing the end goal of that unit.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they seem to have a high integrity,
which in return shows in the end product.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you prefer the electric nail from the
D-Nail?
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: I do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I prefer the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the one that I'm loving right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm rocking, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Random dude that just walked in front of
the camera.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're filming something.
[SPEAKER_13]: He says he likes the D-Nail too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got one and I threw my torch away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes like cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come by the booth later and hit some of my
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the big Quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 18 mil Quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I didn't know you were filming.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that was great.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, there it is right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, it's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first customer went by, throw his
torch away, and that's a statement.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I'm going to take the camera and
I'm going to walk through and pan through
[SPEAKER_15]: and show you guys all the glass that we
were just talking about.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Martin for being here and
coming out and sharing the good work of
[SPEAKER_15]: the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was good to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: You shouldn't lose any potency out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You should just give more of cooperation,
micro-corporation.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my favorite pieces is that luster
cypher right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a pretty cool luster cypher.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as well, I have the double barrel,
just like this one has.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the artwork.
[SPEAKER_09]: Product here?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a new product, a titanium nail for
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we developed a special system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the nail is here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can heat it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once it's hot, you can take it out and
just put it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on the bowl, without having to do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has female food in five.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's domeless.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we work this system all around.
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting, a nail in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, a nail in a bowl, and it comes with
that stand, which pushes up the nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pushes the nail up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now that you can heat it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different from all the other on the
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to get a special one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to mention our new YouTube
channel?
[SPEAKER_09]: Some college with artists and
sandblasting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a hitman in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are
great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tradition meets innovation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So where can we check out more great Ruhr
videos on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_09]: We just started this Ruhr Germany YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_09]: To get connected to the social media world
of today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you guys are going to love the
Ruhr channel.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to be able to see where they
blow their glass.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to be able to see a day in
the life.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to be able to see some
beautiful creations from these guys on a
[SPEAKER_15]: daily basis.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's at Ruhr Germany.
[SPEAKER_15]: Check it out on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_15]: Big Depot, that future shop or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: You order this one special.
[SPEAKER_15]: With these two dudes, introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Chaz.
[SPEAKER_15]: Chaz.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ryan, longtime Bubble Man fans of Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_15]: They just took a nice hit of the barb
first.
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you guys think of the barb?
[SPEAKER_15]: The flavor was insane.
[SPEAKER_15]: Super flavor.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can still taste it now.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just took the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you get an Astro Boy as well?
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you think of that one?
[SPEAKER_15]: So melty.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're sharing dabs down at Champs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at the events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brave McKayla.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's totally awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Madness is this now, Matt.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to create our own dabbing tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finger dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finger dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finger dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've got a nice lineup of people
here for finger dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put it on a tool though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tool dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to get a longer one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is essentially dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab until you want to stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab until you drop?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess it's dabbing until I say stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made that thing a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at it bubbling on the tip of that
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to drip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might drip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's dripping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like a double dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll take some.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll take some.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Matt's been working on getting us
kicked out of our booth all week here at
[SPEAKER_14]: the Champs show.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my booth, and you're getting me
kicked out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_14]: Finger dabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get in there, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get the next guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll move out of the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go and close that off.
[SPEAKER_14]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: 4.50.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you did.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you guys doing here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I talking about, press frozen?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dry sip, barbobot, clean,
99%, granular, trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making a video.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want
[SPEAKER_06]: some more?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you want some more.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the barb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's hitting the barb here today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Barb, she brings people together.
[SPEAKER_15]: While I'm ignoring all my customers here,
they have questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: I better get to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm slightly devastated here at the Champs
2014 show.
[SPEAKER_15]: My puking beacords bowl that I've traveled
across to Europe, Amsterdam, and
[SPEAKER_15]: Barcelona, back to Vancouver, Toronto a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has been smashed into pieces.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're here now at the Champs booth.
[SPEAKER_15]: People are coming by.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Bubble Man, are we going to dab?
[SPEAKER_15]: And what do we tell them, Chester?
[SPEAKER_15]: We tell them we're not fucking dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tragedy has happened here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dab, over.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to see what we can do about
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get back to you.
All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_15]: The D-nail got broken.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a little at error.
[SPEAKER_15]: It happens sometimes when the bowl gets
pulled out and this slides out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that what happened?
[SPEAKER_15]: Rebecca from the Vancouver Sea Bank is,
uh-oh, happened to her.
[SPEAKER_15]: But being the top quality person she is,
she bought a new D-nail and she's letting
[SPEAKER_15]: us use it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to plug it in right now and
have a session with these guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe these guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Check out the new Quartz bowls from
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: Comes with a Quartz carb cap.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_15]: Female plug.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is why we got this.
[SPEAKER_15]: The male to male.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: D-nails plugged back in.
[SPEAKER_15]: The new Quartz bowl is heating up and we
should be having a session in about five
[SPEAKER_15]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Looks like Johnny B is getting interviewed
by Vice.
[SPEAKER_15]: He just hit them up with the barb dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or maybe it was the Medi Cook.
You
[SPEAKER_08]: know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget the meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just stick to right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: BC Lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool to see Vice down here at the booth
interviewing me and Johnny.
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to talk about hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to talk about extractions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're puffing the hash with a big
smile on their faces.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see behind me.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to make some dry sift hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not just going to talk to the camera.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to talk to everyone while we're
making this hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is both the way that John and I
extract our medicine off of the plants
[SPEAKER_15]: that we grow in our personal licenses.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we take whole plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: We dry them for two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually dry the wax membrane of the
glandular trichome head.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is important when we say we're dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't really do it with fresh material
because the wax membrane is going to be
[SPEAKER_15]: hydrated.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you want to see if it has ridges in
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: When it shrinks it has these little
ridges.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not when it's bulbous and fresh.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you do need to dry your material.
[SPEAKER_15]: How long have you been drying?
[SPEAKER_15]: Eight weeks plus.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an exceptional, beautiful,
awesome herb.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's John's strain, the Medi Cush.
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally a floral root that it knows to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very strong.
[SPEAKER_15]: John uses it for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to grind that Medi Cush up
gently over the screens.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to make some dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like my bottom screen upside down like
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this is the screen we're going to
clean the resin that we extract.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get back to this screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, medkits are very handy.
[SPEAKER_15]: In this whole process.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this gives us a little bit of a space
between the two screens.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it'll allow us to work over the top
screen with the canvas.
[SPEAKER_15]: And eventually we'll take this screen and
get it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll work the secondary screen
Most people know what we're doing with the
[SPEAKER_15]: first screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bouncing raw cannabis buds, flowers over
the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we say we're bouncing raw
cannabis flowers, we're bouncing raw
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're bouncing.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people don't know what they
should do at this point.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like to crush it all up in powder.
[SPEAKER_15]: John has a method that he likes to get the
best of the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do a very gentle, gentle light.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things people will be amazed at
and slightly disappointed is that we're
[SPEAKER_15]: not going to get an enormous amount of
yield.
[SPEAKER_15]: What we're trying to show people is the
prohibition-based way of thinking about
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the numbers that we think about in,
oh, I got a pound of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, a pound of cannabis might be 20
grams of cannabis in resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's dry sifting, it might only be like
10 grams, maybe five.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're working at a one to five percent
return for a product like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're using beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice, very cushy, very resinous.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things about dry sifting is
that something that will help you
[SPEAKER_15]: enormously, which is great if you're from
Ontario, is doing it in the cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: So for like seven months of the year,
it's cold here.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go outside and you can do this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the plant is so much more brittle when
it's cold that they really do break off
[SPEAKER_15]: much easier without, it's a
counterintuitive process.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want it to shake the shit out of it,
but then you'll get a lot of contaminant
[SPEAKER_15]: because water's not present.
[SPEAKER_15]: Water's not keeping everything afloat.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bubble bags make this process a joke.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bubble bags will extract through the water
if you use water-soluble terpenes and
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenoids that are flavors that modulate
cannabinoids and that we would rather have
[SPEAKER_15]: them present in our medicine rather than
extract them into the pocket and then pour
[SPEAKER_15]: them down the drain.
[SPEAKER_15]: I personally feed it to my plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if it's going to increase
their terpene content, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_15]: pour my bubble water right into the roots
of my cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: They seem to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got a bit of a warm temperature
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: We should still be able to sift up some
nice resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: So generally when you're at home doing
your own medicine and you're doing a light
[SPEAKER_15]: bounce like this, you can make an up-roll,
a get, or a two-hit, or a three-hit,
[SPEAKER_15]: depending on how much cannabis you're
using.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a variety of ways to extract the
resin carefully so that you don't do what
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone does.
[SPEAKER_15]: The mistake is over-extracting,
extracting too much contaminant and being
[SPEAKER_15]: left with a product that you don't know
how to clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: That resin was so sticky when I touched it
with my hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: It started to melt and liquefy in my hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is not your ideal condition to do
dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Zach, come take a breath while we're doing
this, Matt.
[SPEAKER_15]: Matt's got some finished product,
a dry sift that heat tumbles.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was about 50% plan heads.
[SPEAKER_15]: I cleaned it, so it was about 99% plan
heads, and it turned into this
[SPEAKER_15]: unbelievable... The quality was always
there, but without the purity,
[SPEAKER_15]: you can sometimes not perceive that the
quality was there, even though with Barb,
[SPEAKER_15]: you can't.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even at 30% heads, you can look at Barb
and go, that is insane.
[SPEAKER_15]: Each time you clean it, you're like,
no.
[SPEAKER_15]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_15]: this is a slow process.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do the grinding, we get it broken up
smaller and smaller.
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole environment, this is the worst
environment to be doing this, but we want
[SPEAKER_15]: to do it for you anyway, breaking it up
over the screens, and then when the resin
[SPEAKER_15]: falls through the second screen,
that's where the work comes in.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to clean that resin, and how we
clean it is we push the contaminant
[SPEAKER_15]: through the tighter screen hole,
while hopefully being left with just the
[SPEAKER_15]: plan heads that are 70 micron large.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything else, we have to break through
the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the second screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: You see why it's a good idea to not use
this screen upside down.
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll end up losing your nuggets all over
the floor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lightly touching the buds, not squeezing
them so as to not heat up the glass and
[SPEAKER_15]: press them onto my fingers.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you start photographing and spending
time with your cannabis on a macro level,
[SPEAKER_15]: like this level, you realize that things
that you do and the way you handle your
[SPEAKER_15]: product can produce even that 1% of
contaminant, which to anyone that's OCP,
[SPEAKER_15]: in German,
[SPEAKER_15]: can produce even that 1% of contaminant,
which to anyone that's German,
[SPEAKER_15]: can produce even that 1% of contaminant,
which to anyone that's German,
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce even that 1% of contaminant,
fill your container with ice, and then
[SPEAKER_15]: when you're grinding, the whole thing's
pulled, and you get this real nice sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: pull to drop it over that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The warmer you get it, the more you're
working against yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just buy the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a ton of people standing
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just waiting to put it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to store it for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing about a macro is you
actually have it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 and 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got an extraction screen,
and then you've got a cleaning screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You clean the resin and the farmer's
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you work it together to make it
viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to, you don't have to work the
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make it this clean, you know you
have to just go like this, and it's
viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to dry the bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We do both turn our entire crops into
half.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wet washing, dry sifting, coconut oil
extraction.
[SPEAKER_15]: You get the medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: People are like, wow, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I get pizza, I open the box and eat
it and throw the box away.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's crazy, too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not really crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, I photographed it with my macro
lens.
[SPEAKER_15]: She is photogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a
[SPEAKER_15]: matter of gently sifting it back and
forth, breaking it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: In countries like Morocco, in 1965,
a Nigerian by the name of Mustafa showed
[SPEAKER_15]: up with Lebanese screening techniques.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he changed that for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: That country works with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: The RIP is one of the largest hash
producing areas in the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: It produces some of the most hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not necessarily the best, but definitely
the most.
[SPEAKER_15]: It all started with one guy, some
screening techniques that he rolled in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, Moroccans, what they do is they break
up the herbs.
[SPEAKER_15]: They wrap it in this drum that has a tight
screen over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they've got these sticks.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're in the farm area in Morocco,
in the RIP, you can hear these distant
[SPEAKER_15]: farms.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like they're drumming.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them have different beats,
but most of them are all doing... And it's
[SPEAKER_15]: like all over the place.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a little bit more gentle.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're that rough with it, you wind up
contaminating it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, you're smashing up the herb
until it's small enough to fit through the
[SPEAKER_15]: screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going at it from a different angle.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gently rubbing the resin,
the plant matter over the screen to just
[SPEAKER_15]: let those hands fall through, hopefully
with not as much contaminant.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then John can easily take this
cannabis, and he can decarboxylate it,
[SPEAKER_15]: and he can put it in caps, and he can take
this daily as another supplement to his
[SPEAKER_15]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know this is a bit of a process.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people are just like,
wow, you're going to put a bug like that
[SPEAKER_15]: in the water?
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't even listening to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get them off, get them off.
[SPEAKER_15]: John's taking matters into his own hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the look in that game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went over to get it, and they beat me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello there, Barb.
[SPEAKER_15]: Barb, the dry sift that he made and I
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, a very similar process,
although we used a large tumbler.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I took it, put it over another
screen, and cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: The same thing we're doing right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can freeze this stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you have more bud and you're in a
colder environment, you can really spend
[SPEAKER_15]: more time balancing just the bud.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like probably less than 100 grams
of bud.
[SPEAKER_15]: 60 or 70, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Generally, 100 grams of bud will have
maybe 10 grams of full melt water ash on
[SPEAKER_15]: it, but it could have as low as four to
five grams of full melt water ash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm only expecting 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be that low, one percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: My mentor, who taught me a lot about this,
who made this particular ash, he usually
[SPEAKER_15]: gets 10 grams per kilo.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is one percent.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's skunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's not an adult, originator of skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a superb member of the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a damn inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can
[SPEAKER_15]: throw it across the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not too rubbing it hard, but I like to
throw the material across the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever reason, it usually seems to rub
the material nicely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, these heads are dense.
[SPEAKER_15]: They sink in water, and that's why water
ash is so effective.
[SPEAKER_15]: They do want to fall through the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a matter of how much shit falls
through with water ash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job, Zach.
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good one.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how I treat buds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see what I did to these buds?
We
[SPEAKER_15]: put in there maybe 10 grams of returned
dirty, single-screen sifted resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to clean that up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's so warm in here, it's going
to be real hard to process.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's probably taking about 30 to 40
minutes of carding the resin gently.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how good it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this
[SPEAKER_15]: process, the final process, is a gentle
fanning of the resin over the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Try not to let it stick to your card.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want it to be thick.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to use a lot of resin at a
time, so I didn't use very small amounts,
[SPEAKER_15]: even just in a few cuts.
[SPEAKER_15]: One pass, this is a lighter color than I
saw earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: This looks almost green or white.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of the material will push through
the screen, and a small amount of the
[SPEAKER_15]: material will stay on top.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, way too hot for such a thing,
but you want to dab this up.
You
[SPEAKER_15]: don't want to let the resin build up on
your screen, on your card.
[SPEAKER_15]: Start gumming up more and more of the
resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll return more at times, the barb,
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is an unbelievable producing of
resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: The same amount of herb that was barb just
leaked in insane amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: But whatever's there, we get.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we clean, we card, it's too hot in
here, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get up off the hill.
I think we're going to get melted.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's probably up to, just from that small
amount of carding, it's probably around 70
[SPEAKER_15]: to 80% flange of the heads.
[SPEAKER_15]: That last 20% is a lot to clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most people never get it cleaned beyond 70
or 80.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you get into the 90 and the 99,
there really is a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's acquiring the unadulterated
cannabinoid high.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cure thing that we all love about
cannabis that we all smoke before,
[SPEAKER_15]: or eat it, or use it for this,
but it's about that unadulterated
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoid profile, and that is found in
the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep sifting for a while,
keep working away.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you find when you work in a colder
environment, the resin will just break off
[SPEAKER_15]: so much easier.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why some of my videos on YouTube
are literally outside and it's like minus
[SPEAKER_15]: 10.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I sift it for that feed me?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you're passing around to
show everyone, but that's not a
cannabinoid.
It's made in a colder environment.
It's melted into liquid.
It is literally what everyone loves about
cannabis.
I am telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it again, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new nail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there was just one right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, what, costed money and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was like none.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was none anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Van and his house, you know,
or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even have skipped a beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be right back, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be right back.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're with, with hydroponic organic and
you've shown, you're showing us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you do a hydronic.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how you grow and it's Julie.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you're going to show us some of your
wares.
[SPEAKER_15]: So give us a show here.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_15]: that was a nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to take a photo of me?
[SPEAKER_13]: All you do is you press it down a little
bit and then all the way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: How's it going with the dry sifting,
John?
[SPEAKER_15]: You got yourself a seat now and you're
just gently rubbing your back and forth
[SPEAKER_15]: and this is what you do at home.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is your method.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really cool how many people were
standing around and listening to us and as
[SPEAKER_15]: we were going on about how we do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the education is key and that's what
we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to educate people on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as you can see, we're getting it
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, we're getting everything
down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting everything down to the end
of the, the end of seeing what we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, myself, I keep grinding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I kind of want everything from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm going to bake it in an oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll come back when we lift the screens.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, hey, let's see you through the holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go home and make dabs now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_15]: Little crush throws and not getting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes my camera doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dabs from the slab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a great buzz going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just bumped into Mastarola.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys probably know him from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got a pretty huge following.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always called it the straight fab with
the straight flower of life.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Brand new courts that we've been hitting
for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what am I smoking on?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're smoking on the great gardeners full
melt Afghani dry sift that I cleaned.
[SPEAKER_15]: With bubble bags?
[SPEAKER_15]: With those screens right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: With the screens in the bathroom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Drop it in there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: He knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mastarola.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a baby dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how you do it, man.
That was a baby dab.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy smoking, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, high five.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the way to hit a dab, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to hit one of those as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll give you the cami.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just turn that around for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll hit that one too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also like to take the nice sized dabs
considering I take 50 to 100 of them a
[SPEAKER_15]: day.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really need to blow out my lung
and impress anyone by trying to take the
[SPEAKER_14]: whole dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: At least every time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a carb cap to top it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubblebag.com.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy smoking, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't Ryan.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was John.
[SPEAKER_15]: Was your buddy's name Ryan?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remembered one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you just got, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are so sick.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow,
[SPEAKER_15]: look at this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look what I have.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pipe ceramic nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jeez, it would fit nice on that piece
right there, boy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on the back.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're pretty happy about that,
I bet, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are we looking at here?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got 73 micron, full melt, vanilla kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your work?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually my friend Alex's work.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alex, we're going to give you a shot,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Alex is the one that had the good news
with, if you've seen him earlier,
[SPEAKER_10]: he had the CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was 21%, almost 21%.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: CBD, so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kind of wanted to show the inside of
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to show it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was an on purpose maneuver.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just worm it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please take a look.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, rip it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're hitting bowls.
[SPEAKER_15]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was blue smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys all hit it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: First D-Nail rep?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we hit the OG kush that was three year
old cured bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Three year cured.
[SPEAKER_15]: And John is still, still dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we got there, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the golden gravy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's only one swipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking good, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be working hard and someone's got to
give me a D-Nail rep.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's show that pendant again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Who did that pendant?
[SPEAKER_15]: Jordan Mann from Family Dog Glass.
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what brought me over to bring you
over.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for loving it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank Jordan.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dab's up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Another longtime watcher of the bubble
man's world.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come by the booth for a dab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is easy to work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is easy to work on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to say welcome to bubble man's
world, but we're sort of down in the dumps
[SPEAKER_15]: right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a great day, you know, right up
until about six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were educating people.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were sharing, showing John was breaking
up buds and we were dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone had broken the D-Nail and that was
devastating and it came around and they
[SPEAKER_15]: bought a new D-Nail and they replaced it
and let us use the bowl and it was all
[SPEAKER_15]: great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, right before I left,
someone stole my $5,000 5D Canon Mark III
[SPEAKER_15]: with my camera chips and the battery and
the lens, the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're just trying not to be
disappointed in humanity right now,
[SPEAKER_15]: trying not to be bummed out, but you know,
it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a camera.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a very expensive camera and it's
a camera that's very important to the
[SPEAKER_14]: shows that John and I bring you here on
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: To everybody here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when I go to the great Gardner
and I go photograph there, when I go to
[SPEAKER_15]: Remos, you know, I use that camera to take
those pictures and I use the camera to
[SPEAKER_15]: record videos.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm not sure how it's going to
affect us.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I felt like I had to share it with you
guys because, you know, you guys are a big
[SPEAKER_15]: part of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the guys that are watching all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to let you know today
we're a bit bummed.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're a bit bummed.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a real nice gentleman that came
by and gave me some nice water hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was nice of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I actually picked up another
container that was left down there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, what are the possibilities of dabbers
having been brought back?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_15]: We brought them?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: I left the booth at the end and John was
kind enough to pack it up and close house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just devastated.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't want to be bumming everyone out.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, you know, it was a good day
today.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted this video to finish off proper,
but I mean, maybe it still can.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we'll turn it around and we'll still
finish this day off good.
[SPEAKER_15]: But right now at about eight thirty p.m.
[SPEAKER_15]: sitting in the hotel, it's Mark Kloke the
weed guy's VIP party tonight.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was supposed to go there and feed
people dabs all night and I'm just
[SPEAKER_15]: completely, you know, devastated by this
camera loss.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if John ends up finding one of the
three dabbers that we had down there
[SPEAKER_15]: today, we will dab it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the scooper.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did lose both dabbers, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's one somewhere I remember
packing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just open up here.
[SPEAKER_15]: My phone has not stopped beeping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: My phone has not stopped beeping.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's yours, but we can use it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's literally.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going off.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going off.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going off about this is because of
your camera that was stolen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's like, wow, they can't believe
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me clean this for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guy out there that's going to watch
this video and see all these comments is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go, holy fuck, man, I'm a real
piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's pretty unfortunate,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bumming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm choking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 1973.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just other stuff I found in that
booth there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I had even some 93 blueberries
sitting on the D-nail powder.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was from 93.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was blueberry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it should be there.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's common sense.
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of is, you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just a lot of people in the booth
today and somehow that camera walked out.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that I can somehow figure out a
way to locate that camera, potentially
[SPEAKER_15]: with GPS, potentially with EXIF data.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if not that, I'm going to have to
figure this out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it's an insurable product,
I do not know.
[SPEAKER_15]: It could have potentially been a complete
and total loss.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's kind of the way I'm taking it
right now, that it's a total loss.
[SPEAKER_15]: So wanted to give you guys the update.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the update.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry that it's not as happy as normal.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
