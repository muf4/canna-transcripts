[SPEAKER_03]: Alright guys, so we got a little cut short
the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go pick up my kid, and I
apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids first, when you're a good dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're back at Chris' shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a day later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's a few days later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, where are we going to go today?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go around the seawall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Vancouver Stanley Park seawall,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got the boosted boards again.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can tell, we're not just wearing
these helmets because we fall down often.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're on the boards, and we're going
to cruise around the seawall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll probably finish it off either at
this lounge or at another lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this lounge probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have a pop charge boards up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for another cruise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and go for another cruise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do GoPro footage as well
as cam footage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's get the show started,
bro.

as hard as it seems Lions, which are in
[SPEAKER_03]: the background, and if you go over the top
of the lions, you end up in my area,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Lions Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, look at the size of this thing,
hey?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on the bridge when this thing
went by before and it was with me and
[SPEAKER_03]: Tosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I'll get a good shot of you right
there, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more piece, sign it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there we go, hang loose even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang loose even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the boosted in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always better when, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got double boosted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's have a session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing sure doesn't clear the bridge by
much, hey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is a big boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering there's a smaller boat in
front of it, really giving you the size
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely fits into my wide angle lens
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely fit the whole boat in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knocking boards over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so Chris called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time for a little puff session.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought the little ceramic pen,
little vape pen, but I think we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: go full.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you brought it, you should use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, wait a minute now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure we got all the pieces,
all the components that are necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a nice day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each nice day gets a good second for a
nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be cooking this summer
too, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there any, like, really nice new
pavement out in Lyons Bay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in the mountains there or anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best place in Lyons Bay would
probably be some of the upper streets are
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good, but it's mostly long boarders
who are going at extreme speeds down and
[SPEAKER_03]: sliding with hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when they have those world
competitions down in Washington,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's usually about five or six of those
guys that drive up over the border,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they hit a few spots in the
British properties, and they usually get
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as Lyons Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: These boards, I think they would be really
amazing for Squamish, because now Squamish
[SPEAKER_03]: has a seawall type of thing that goes
throughout it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Whistler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Whistler and even Pemberton has
quite a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this could become really
popular along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, get a little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the easiest, I think,
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do a little LHO from Horatio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab-a-doodle-a.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I can't tell you how stoked I am on
this whole experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard not to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like stoked, you know,
just coming up on 53 to be able to rip
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, you're ripping them hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought all that stuff was like a thing
of my past, you know, all the surfing and
[SPEAKER_02]: skating and stuff had been so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of what I needed to
reinvigorate my life a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: was that kind of adrenaline rush,
stoked, you get off the board sports,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hitting this egg song water again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought lemonade, but I just didn't feel
like putting lemonade in the fab egg.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess I could have,
but I think I'd rather just...
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny torch, and wind is definitely not
your friend with these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's what Matt will be flying in
on tomorrow?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, Matt Barron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barron, the great gardener's coming in for
a ride tomorrow, so... Alright,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's see if I can get this working here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that was actually really nice
rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get you one real quick so we
can head out on our way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I have to say, when I'm doing stuff
like this, I don't want to sit around and
[SPEAKER_03]: puff for like an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really just want to have a... Hit,
and then back on the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, all board sports,
it's like, you know, you go to any
[SPEAKER_02]: snowboarded scene, and there's going to be
the hardcore guys that are hitting the
[SPEAKER_02]: herb and hitting the hill hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to a surf break.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be the hardcore surfers
that are hitting the session on the beach
[SPEAKER_02]: before they paddle out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skateboard park, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, like, I think that in
regards to board sports and those types of
[SPEAKER_02]: sports, cannabis can really throw you in
that zen headspace where you just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: get in the zone with what you're doing and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: If performance enhancement is right,
but...
[SPEAKER_02]: Performance focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, performance focus for sure,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's literally claiming now that cannabis
is a performance enhancement drug for him,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I think that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to take him out for a skate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, he'd be really down to
this, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could definitely get Ross to come and
cruise around with us on these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe when we go up to Whistler,
we'll make sure that he's around and we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: bring the extra board with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that bubble man's world is going
to become electric skateboard man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best transport for the city,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to go for groceries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh good, I've got to get some
groceries, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab the pack pack and get the skateboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you get all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so here, we'll hit you on this
side right here.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good old Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: People aren't even surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look over and they just don't even
shake their heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the shake your head about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of guys hitting a fab egg
under the Lions Gate Bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back to skateboarding,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it one day at a time and fulfill your
dreams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, no one is an island,
no one stands alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your doings, always remember your
theme.
[SPEAKER_05]: All when things get hard and lean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on to your faith and fulfill your
beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't you worry, worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never give in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you worry, worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never give in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Test of time, test of patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like in the days of patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the man called Joe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He tried it for rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew where he was going, so he knew
where he was coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe in yourself, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't you worry, worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never give in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you worry, worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never give in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, my people keep doing the positive
that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, kids, pack your bags, time to go to
school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, farmer, you start the engine,
you got this thing rolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell you what to do on the street
side, loafing, rising of the winds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't you worry, worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never give in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you worry, worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, believe me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never give in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you worry, worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: High mountains of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Deep valleys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flat surface of the world.
People living, they're living.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just stop where you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: As life goes by.
[SPEAKER_07]: As life goes by.
[SPEAKER_07]: Goes by.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn your starter on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get your engine in gear.
[SPEAKER_07]: And leave the stagnant waters,
waters behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just leave the stagnant, stagnant waters
behind.
