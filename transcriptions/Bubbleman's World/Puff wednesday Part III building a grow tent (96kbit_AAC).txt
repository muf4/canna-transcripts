[SPEAKER_02]: Alright guys, so we're down here at John's
truck and John has brought the goods once
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to transport stuff for growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us what you got, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first off the hop is of course we
need some bulbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And?
[SPEAKER_04]: Covering both spectrums?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the bulbs that you have picked
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean I've grown one batch with the
Digilux so far and it was full melt,
[SPEAKER_02]: super resinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one that I smoked it with asked me if I
used any weird light bulbs or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got to give these guys the thumbs
up so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used both the metal halide and the HPS
and that was along with the NanoLux
[SPEAKER_02]: ballast which I'm sure we showed you these
guys before but this thing is so
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on this nice angle too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's size.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that size of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked on the Nano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we'll put that aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some cocoa fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocoa fiber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, stoked on the cocoa fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using this like mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for proper drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really gets a good, in fact even one of
the places recently I was at they used
[SPEAKER_02]: straight cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a lot of people do use straight
cocoa when they're doing it in bigger,
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they get into the 10, 20 gallons where
they just go straight cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good for draining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gets great, great root structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that whole root testing with cocoa
with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have more with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got your hard pots here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you got the hard pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two gallons and three gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a transplant on both
the sick hash plants today.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go into a five gallon
with some very, very dry pro mix cocoa
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three gallons, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we've got two more things
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be losing the pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop off the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so two things left in the truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to jump in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the one that we're excited
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: One more way of jumping onto the new
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy cloner, power cloner, do it yourself,
cloner, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the classic 10 gallon reservoir,
45 plant sites, got the neoprene pads for
[SPEAKER_02]: holding the clones, the misters
underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'd have fun with this one,
John.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually had these running at the
store there and we've had them there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work great.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who have picked them up,
love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stoked that there's one actually in
the house now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well this way when we need clones of any
five, you know, like sweet condos,
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani, Barb, My Little Pony,
Betty Kush, Astro Boy, the Jamaican and
[SPEAKER_04]: hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing pretty good there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just lined up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four to five plants, five of each one,
eight different, eight rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's put that aside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, of course,
that tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the secret jar, the DR240W.
[SPEAKER_04]: My tent, I have the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, this is the exact same one we did
last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't probably go into the full detail
like we did last time, but we want to show
[SPEAKER_02]: you at least the simple framing of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have a nice camera view for you
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to do the power cloner as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take that up to my
office and set that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you want to set up first,
John?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the power cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power cloner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you guys up at the office.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to rock out the power
cloner, Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open her up, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a 45 site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like how that opened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never opens nice like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these guys did something wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to show you what it was here,
and now we're going to set her down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like I could just dump it right out,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, we're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny going for the rip, I'm going for
the easy peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go and she's all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go for the basketball.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Two minutes left in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, two seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to pass it over?
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble man's a failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be the goods right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw basically how this fits into here,
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of drops in here, and all the jets
are fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it basically, this is the cords,
and that just sits right on top,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent us prices for all the different
reservoirs, sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got white and black, 10 gallon,
20 gallon, and 40 gallon, if you can
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big old 40 galloners.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that, like 125 sites or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the pucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well I'm thinking I might
listen to my buddy Kingston, who's got the
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe down on lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is rhizosphere root inoculant for
seedling and transplants, and then aqua
[SPEAKER_02]: shield and power clone, both from
Botanicare Solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we can have a pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: General purpose utility pump, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoses, and these will probably be the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pucks and maybe the other pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: These would be the little emitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the power cord for the pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you got the emitters, the little jets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's the instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to follow the
instructions, because what a great idea to
[SPEAKER_02]: follow the instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power cable for the power cord for the...
Yeah, no, it's just a little pump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, for the air stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw it had air stones as well as
this pump that jets out the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll leave those in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what we got going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the reservoir and clone tray,
the humidome, the manifold, which is this
[SPEAKER_02]: little guy right here, the clear tubing,
which is right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our food right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the mag pump, the mag drive
pump, the single air pump, that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: had in your hand there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 13 yellow sprayers, 15 yellow
sprayers, and 35 yellow sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure which one we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,
[SPEAKER_02]: 13, 14, 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14, so it's probably 13 with an extra one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always nice if you want an extra
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 neoprene inserts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to count those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the air stones are the only thing
I didn't see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They must be in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there they are right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: 47 in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you counted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny is a... Since he smacked his head,
he's real good with numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real good with numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what are the lottery winning numbers
going to be for next... 9, 11,
[SPEAKER_04]: 21, 23, 36, 41.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power Bowl, that's $200 million win.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only expect about a 2% return on that
if you wouldn't mind sending that to Kara
[SPEAKER_02]: of Bubble Man's world, Johnny Pimp Slap a
B for fellow, and Bubble Man, Marcus G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Williger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get into this here,
John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, run water through the manifold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rinse power corner parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your corner is clean and debris
free before using.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be done by rinsing all components
prior to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a hose right over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we've rinsed this out, which I'll go
do right now, we're going to insert the
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayers, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insert the sprayers.
Oh, wow.
That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it fell a pretty good distance,
but it was still protected, so... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's rinsing things off there right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a better look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to take a quick look.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said he watched the video on it,
so I haven't, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: We set one up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks as though all the jets are
clear and free.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to spin these all over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like, yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hose right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit of water in that is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's literally about putting all of
those little guys into there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to pass me a handful,
we can both just... What did I do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: directionals?
[SPEAKER_02]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gently thread a sprayer into each side on
the manifold.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are all the way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said gently, but yeah, in the
pictures, they're all the way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we keep going?
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets pretty tough on the hands,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this one's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it depends on if you come in at a
strange angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did, your fingers are going to
hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to close them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've rinsed our manifold.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've installed our sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the yellow hole punch wrench,
the yellow hole punch wrench to tighten
[SPEAKER_02]: the sprayers until snug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your arrows are pointed away
from the reservoir wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not over tighten as this is your
thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, this is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading the instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, John, I love doing this
stuff with you because I'm kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really always pay full attention
to what's going on with the instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're just like, how could I not be
able to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, we just put it in very
loosely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did it completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we did fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually I do it completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to screw these little bottoms
onto this pump here so it's snug.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great little tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really tightens these little guys up
nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fingers was not, I wasn't feeling
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just stopped as I come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it wasn't super enjoyable,
was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard little plastic piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pretty excited about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say I've heard these little do it
yourself and the easy cloners and power
[SPEAKER_02]: cloners are all really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I had a huge problem with the
cloning, but I need something a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more no brainer with my setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this seems like it could potentially
be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, really like all the products I
use, this is really like a review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now power cloner never sent this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went and bought one and let's
realize there's this nice beautiful coach
[SPEAKER_02]: behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, take a look off Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of the slow arduous work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting that done, taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon we'll have the ability to rock 45
clones in the blink of an eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best part about it's going to be
they're just basically roots, just water.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be no pucks, no dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can go into several different
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually all systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can transplant them into anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I like about it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gives us a chance to actually
experiment a little bit more too and have
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit more fun at the same time.
I haven't had the opportunity of actually
getting into one of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just felt like it was too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't need to have that many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's really for me, it's about
sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I find that it's just more of a
convenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well in the sharing, here with the
commercial, not commercial, but the MMPR
[SPEAKER_02]: or the MMAR, how we are able to make
things work for us is that we are able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: John's able to bring me a Medi Kush and
I'm able to stay here legal to Congo and
[SPEAKER_02]: Doc is able to show up and say here's
Harmony and a Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is key that we aren't supposed to
mother out every single strain that we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to have access to because we need
access to more than one strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I think I'm around the 30 strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to have 20 to 30 strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what I like to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure there's people out there that
could literally use more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you think of the
incredible... And then this whole thing
[SPEAKER_04]: turns into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that great?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fun, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just put this little filter on the
end here so nothing else gets in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If any roots come off the bottom,
they don't get stuck in the pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very important that you put the
filter on the pump too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've already wrapped it,
which is quite nice with cellophane tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually already got the water
signal attached to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I just did all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfectly perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all pointing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The arrows are all pointing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spin this into here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't need it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dropping the tool, dropping the tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this supposed to point a certain way
when we're done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, actually hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go through the...
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hold that there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll spin this perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a spin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is... They said hand tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what's going to happen is it's
going to be like...
[SPEAKER_02]: The cord's going to go into here and this
piece is going to go right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, I guess what it will have to
do is it will have to line up something
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Place the air pump on a stable surface
outside the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only air pump can help though.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is simple, simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will point the other way,
the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cord needs to go on the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could probably go around with one
full more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got quite a bit of threading left.
[SPEAKER_02]: With watery objects, you always go more
than less.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that doable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably how they designed it
because that's just slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's your cord.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fits in there perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should just show you how that just went
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got it all lined up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are pretty smart on their
design.
[SPEAKER_02]: A no brainer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got your cord that
basically goes into this little guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be able to pull it up if we need it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Install the manifold.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sitting in here perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the filter faces away from the
cord guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push down firmly to seat the manifold into
the reservoir so you can really get it
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Install the air pumps and air stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is super easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crack those bad boys up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this nice nice stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a nice single one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power cooler 7.
Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this should be one long cord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're only going to use one of the
stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe we need two.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other filter that uses two has a
double here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one only has the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so attach one air stone to end of tube
and the air pump is to the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just attach one of those to there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll attach this to here and that's
literally done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just coming together quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how most things work when we put
things together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we make a little mistake here and
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to put this in here so
the water doesn't splash out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you go right to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the air stump was in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are quite nice little neoprene
pucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm wondering if you just,
I guess you would plant them each time or
[SPEAKER_02]: you just take them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you take them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take them out, you open it up,
you put them out and then you rinse this
[SPEAKER_04]: off and you put them back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you only want to have this many,
you only have to have this many.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have all the whole film or the
water sprays out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm feeling right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We learned that the hard way at work and
we came in the next day and all the water
[SPEAKER_04]: was out of it and it was all over the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sprays like a mother, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it just starts leaking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was just because of leaving the
few of these pucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's why I'm using mine in my office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to put this on top of the
table and that table is going to sit in
[SPEAKER_02]: top, inside of a four foot by four foot,
basically a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way if it does leak, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it drops the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a 10 gallon rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us, it was just us starting it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we did that, put all these in,
we never had a problem again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it was just that one little
mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you read the directions, funny enough,
I bet you it's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's probably literally right in
there and says, make sure you put all the
[SPEAKER_02]: pucks in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I think maybe they're all out and
that's a couple out or something happened
[SPEAKER_04]: where if you take these pucks out,
you get water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a good tip to give people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there two extra?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I said 47, there was 48.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were darn close.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quality closeness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So boom and our little dome.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one we have at work is completely see
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've never actually seen this type of
bottle yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The power cloner 45 plant unit from
botanica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, potentially might have these up on the
site.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to first check the product and see
how much I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the quality of the plastic dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty thick and this is really nice
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll let you know how it goes guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've done, let's see, we've done a
meeting with Doc Atomic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got to do the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a meeting with Doc Atomic,
a meeting with Matt, the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: You came over, we talked, we exchanged,
uh, you gave me the, the gifts of Medi
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and my little pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doc Atomic brought the harmony and the
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, uh, maybe go have a session and
then get that done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So deja vu, we're here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's our, there's our old work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another secret garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight by four foot tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys watched this last time and saw it
set us up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, uh, then stick around because
we're about to do it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a nice little bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes in just like last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's some components.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might as well work right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These poles are really Yeah, just
lightening them up and get them all on.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a skirt for the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have loved to have swept the
garage, but I think it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of know what we're doing this time
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what we're doing last thing
you ever said.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit out of the way here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing is completely like already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the other one come like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just have to open it up,
which I believe we opened up the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which goes all the way up to here.
Open
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, it goes down to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way around.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be horrible sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got for corners here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the best first thing to do is
to connect the eye to a corner slot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use this on my other one and it's best
if you put the frame in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: skirt rather than try to put the skirt in
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to put the skirt in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what I noticed last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the skirt laid down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all this stuff lifted up so we're not
hiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crucial components.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes the other way actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the Velcro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost always do things the opposite way
as what they go the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess as long as you get it right in
the end, that's really all that matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the Velcro on the inside of the pieces
and the corners that the balls will go
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pull that into place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of makes it a little bit easier even,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I need one more corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many corners you got there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Four?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't one on your end?
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two middles.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, three, middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an extra one here, but I need a
fourth one for the top corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one right here, but I need this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the one I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to keep you looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll leave that one with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one with this one.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladders in position.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got your A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a couple of A's?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of A's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your A.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're grabbing your friend's A.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the middle piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you just go like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits in here just like a glove.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's snug.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I would make sure you're going
to have a bit of a hard time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's not connected yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that piece is in before we push
these guys together.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a bit of a tough nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really tough,
seemingly as impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you can pull on that as hard as you
can.
[SPEAKER_04]: This piece is set to the top.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you pass me them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one to the top.
This
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot this side not being able to sort
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to make this tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quick and easy tent up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's actually quite straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only hanging a single light today
because we've got the LED from Lush on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once that arrives, we'll be able to
step that up into the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the tent to the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, it's just going to be the one
high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to put your tops on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do one at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember doing this last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to put the poles in the
middle again, which is going to be our
[SPEAKER_04]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to have three,
one for the top and the middle here.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, take that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then is this going to go in between
these two?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's already on.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, I'm going to pretty sure it's
just these ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all that's left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just go one, two, three,
four.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually hear it push together.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how easy that was, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think we did that during 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the tent up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we pull it up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're at this stage where we start
with one side and it's left there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this was the top we did last
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the top right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so tight here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like impossibly tight.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I broke it out of the thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That went in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that six inches we needed,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure all the zippers are on
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's just a matter of zipping her up.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the zipper on your end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to get in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hold them on the inside right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get me to grab the zipper.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, if you don't have a friend helping
you with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually did this by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll never do that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super no fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo-yah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out the side here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super no fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again for all your help,
John.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always such a pleasure to work
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've seen the Power Cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen the 8x4 Jardin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably going to do a small setup
with the ballast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we'll film it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do, you'll be seeing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, time to hit some fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tent setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go hit some fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to mount that ballast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love this little grate stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually pulled this out of your
freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, out of my fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, out of my freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to be able to mount it,
and mount it like that, and even have a
[SPEAKER_04]: little ledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you could put the little time and
temperature gauge on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put your little stuff in there,
which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how friends help each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked out very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy, then we'll mount this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: This side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like that, people.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how the little zippy straps work well?
[SPEAKER_04]: The set straps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, zippies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's turned into, now we got to maybe take
this in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm going to do, what we just
talked about, is just mounting this sucker
[SPEAKER_04]: right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just get the camera organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we're not going to use this
hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can almost flip this up and around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it would be mounted already,
Jon.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: There you guys go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, Thor?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sweet, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to reinforce it, just zip it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one of these in here, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is awesome, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty happy with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it when a plan comes together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that easy, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was that easy, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, that was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, I guess what's left to do,
unfortunately, I don't have the proper
[SPEAKER_02]: shade, and I don't have my LED light here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have a simple mobile socket here,
porcelain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to hang that right in the
middle here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to hang that for a
day or two until I get my proper LED light
[SPEAKER_02]: and my ballast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it perfect how that just works in
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, that's the whole purpose,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: There she goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear the intake and the outtake on
that little NanoLux.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to lose our power right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move on to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go change my battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we're time to stick that light in
there, Jonny.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shelf worked out so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pulled it off there, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to use the Digilux metal
halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you like my metal halide?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, it's got the really,
yeah, these are killer, killer nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how this thing opens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take that box for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to take the box?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's light that up and see
what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it'll look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I suspect is another metal halide
lighting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this where it doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's where it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't it not work?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was freaking you out though,
Jon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was freaking out a little bit myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was like a great way of doing things
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone through this once before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything always works for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, this isn't finished the way
it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put in the adjuster so I
can move it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get a shade on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The HPS is going to, this is a metal
halide, but the HPS is going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go over on this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over on this side here, I'm going to have
a two times XL dominator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this whole side of the tent will be
dominator.
[SPEAKER_02]: That side will be HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right in the middle, we'll get a
little combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mounting our fans in the corners?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's mount a fan or two into the
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, let's mount one right into that
corner and then let's fill this tent up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's two right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a couple right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congolese and Barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were just about to throw the 10
plants that are going into the tent that
[SPEAKER_02]: we just built and we decided, you know,
it's best to put these in, in a three
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon pot rather than a two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not looking to stretch them out beyond
stretch out, but I really believe in the
[SPEAKER_02]: power of the roots having somewhere to go
right before you put them into bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really gives that plant a happy
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pull off the Barb tag there,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I'm going to throw that Barb
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going to throw Barb
in here right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll transplant it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the first one I grabbed off
the wall here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get some nice coco fiber and pro mix
that John had me do when he first came
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be enough right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at those beautiful white roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Barb's healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way the sides fell apart and
filled in the bottom hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks like we were
professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks like we know what we're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks like we know what we're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, usually with the sides,
I've got to do this whole finger thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but these are pretty much packed already.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up is the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this next tent for me is going to be
all Sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I chose not to do the Barb this
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to take that Barb home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a Barb blooming in the other tent
right now, so I'm quite excited to have
[SPEAKER_02]: that start going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've Afghani as well blooming in there
with some many hazes and some My Little
[SPEAKER_02]: Ponies and some Astro Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited about flowering out the
Congo, maybe more so than any strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: I have right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to just learn the activities
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really tasted it, grown with
many one organically done yet,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, really nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping you hit it with your Medi Kush
mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a real fun experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so here's the Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up next?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo-hoo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure doesn't take a lot of mud or dirt,
soil-less to clean the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want them over-stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right, Congo it up there,
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing the uncomfortable wheeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label's on there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you put it on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, love those roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're nice and fat roots,
aren't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to miss that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to get it in somewhat straight there
so it's not growing at a crazy funky
[SPEAKER_02]: angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Congolese.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we'll be able to get enough
foam melts, beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might need to get one this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it's really about me
having a place to dry the actual crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my sort of problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's dump in a little side
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super stoked on the sativa tent in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I do have sativas in my other
tent, I have John's My Little Pony and I
[SPEAKER_02]: have his Medi Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both going in there, so it's not a
sativa tent by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of Astro Boys in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Hoss.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some sweet skunk coming up next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sweet skunk is next up on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to fill up my five gallon bucket
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm kind of stepping out of the
way right now, and I'm going to just label
[SPEAKER_04]: these spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: My sweet skunk has now rooted just nicely
at my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, same with the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Barb, they're going to be going down
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my smile on your face, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to be able to take a bit of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so nice to have a big bin full of
perfectly mixed soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an earth reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that's a Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a couple of sweet skunks coming
up next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two sweet skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's drop them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still has roots on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's healthy, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to grab a big old can full of
dirt if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are always so happy to get
transplanted from, I really like starting
[SPEAKER_02]: in one gallons, going to twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to threes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of gives the roots like hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like they've hit this wall and
they're like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you kind of come along and you
say, hey, why don't we give you a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more room there, bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we just did for all of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for perfect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, transplant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting your resin ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing the quick cleanup on the soil that
we spilt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my little trusty piece of cardboard
for my sore knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica style, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, someplace I'm going to be real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A place we're both going to be real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are going to be there with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we toss these plants inside
the tent and bring that around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the barb we're thinking about maybe
leaving out right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first thing is the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I remember you saying correctly,
you wanted a sweet skunk on this side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the LED, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're both going to be on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three sweet skunks and I have
three, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep that right like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pass you a congle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go next to that sweet skunk,
like right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can put a sweet skunk over on
the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the other corner side.
Action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another congolese for that
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to have another
congolese go in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a sweet skunk middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice sweet skunk middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this sweet skunk is going to be
rocking it, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what do we have down over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have... That's the barb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have an East Coast Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have a second one of these I can
bring in and that way I can do... Right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do East Coast Sour Diesel here and I
can do East Coast Sour Diesel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that... Look at this room, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this little concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for now... This is fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now we'll throw barb in with the
ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because there's room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll exchange barb with an East Coast
Sour Diesel when we get a chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I've got the biggest smile on
my face because look what I'm around,
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's nice, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to be able to grow your own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The XL Dominator is going to go right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll cover a good chunk of this tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This light will be over on that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, buddy, I want to thank you
so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks for the help and we'll get the
Medi-Cush in here next time, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a really good Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was non-stop and it was long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you guys for watching
and spending all this time with me and
[SPEAKER_02]: John and all the other interesting
characters that come along and visit us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be the last real big
show, I would think, before we bugger off
[SPEAKER_02]: to Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto for the Next Gen Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jamaica after that for the pilot
project that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fan's kicking it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just shut that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that hyper fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we have a few more plants
that I forgot about, which were the two
[SPEAKER_02]: that John brought, the Medi-Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the My Little Pony number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Little Pony phenome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from Dr. Atomic, we got the
Harmony, which was via reefer man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got the Northern Lights,
one of his favorite lemony, fruity,
[SPEAKER_02]: citrusy Northern Lights strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So My Little Pony's down there,
Medi-Cush, Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give you a couple.
Thank you.
And I'm going to take a couple.
We'll get these guys down on the old...
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to put too, too much in
here with these little guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that'll be about good right there
with that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got with Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same, same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably use even a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see that they're a little bit lower
than anticipated.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one is the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I always got paper in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really growing into it very
well, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of chunk right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to worry about any rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: These roots are a little bit, a little bit
brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like they could use a lot of
lovin'.
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Yeah, this one's very wet as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got a really high concentration of
cocoa this time around, if you've noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on my material there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really loaded it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's maybe even like 40 to 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to experiment and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like the idea of having better
drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with that,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best part about it, you got to be able to
get everything in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I'll do right away
for this, as well as for the My Little
[SPEAKER_02]: Pony there is I'll be printing off labels
right now and we'll be getting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: On there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we've got the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just put his... I've got my little
sticks that I'll just stick in there for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even when I don't have a name,
I'm happy to have a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just put Harmony on there for now
until I get my little printed up piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, the NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medi-Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Medi-Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medi-Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like the Medi-Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those ones are brown too though,
eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, we really got to get these roots
healthier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been in this one gallon pot for
like three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreo!
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's so high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on up, bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be transplanted here and you can
see the purple stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little stressed because all those
roots were all bound up in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that's why the paper's in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why it's supposed to be a
trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should ask him about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know about it
myself, so that's why I'm releasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just try to keep it real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I know and it's kind of a
simple sort of method, which is just...
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen that before and there must
be a reason to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Dr. Atomic, so... Yeah, well,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do something for 30 or 40 years,
sometimes that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just might be the reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seems like it worked and I've
been doing it for 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll ask the doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get him on camera and we'll find out
what his reasoning is with the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the secret of the paper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this plant was healthier looking,
I would maybe believe that it was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: something good, but the plant is a little
bit sickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stressed beyond belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's producing only three leavers,
if you notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not actually many five or seven
leavers on the plant, but we'll get it
[SPEAKER_02]: back to health.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bring it back real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super excited to have it in the
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is the NL, there's the Harmony,
and there's the Medi and the My Little
[SPEAKER_02]: Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just like that, a couple more plants
have been transplanted and the stable
[SPEAKER_02]: grows even bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so one more thing I just forgot
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Tomick brought me Harmony and Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: John brought me Medi Kush and My Little
Pony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't want to send, well,
Dr. Tomick I sent home with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's taken most everything, but not
everything's rooted on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Congo didn't root for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Congo didn't root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, dude, how about these?
[SPEAKER_02]: For you.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you, small amigos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to take this barb home,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry, that's not the barb that I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a barb I want to give you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a barb right now that I'm going to
be flipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, what's great about that
is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barb bar rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can flip that pretty much right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say when I flip my next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give this one a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I come back from Jamaica,
that's when I'm doing my next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, when you come back from
Jamaica, these are going to be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are going to be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say they're as big as these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you've got the Barbara,
you've got the Congolese, and this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We share things out of our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea I was going to pull these
out of the garden for John today,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my good buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surrounded in genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right on, John.
Enjoy that.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Thank you.
