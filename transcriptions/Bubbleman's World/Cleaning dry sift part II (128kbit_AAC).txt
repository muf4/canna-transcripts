[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to go over part two of
cleaning that sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you remembered, I cleaned this
guy out a little bit the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was covered in this stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure what exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, but it's not hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks quite a bit like what you would
pull out of a carpet with one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: carpet rakes from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not really sift that I would
normally clean, but because I did part one
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share part two with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my screen set up and I've got my
cards for carding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my little brush for brushing away
the resin once I've carded and cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually a little bit left over on
the screen that I need to get away and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really card up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to actually have the brush to
clean it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally blow on it and it'll
clear the screen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of resin in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen this before where I give it a
little shake and it falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little rain, a little rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just get a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a variety of cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of paper cards that are
obviously a lot less sturdy and strong
[SPEAKER_00]: than a hotel entrance card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed this one out of Toronto the last
time we were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite a strong plastic card and
it's the one that I'm going to choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically this is the thing to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the process and because it's such
a slow process it's hard for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to push this resin through the
screen and it's actually going quite nice
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's such a small amount of
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the contaminant will of course
push through the screen and this is slow
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the slowest, slowest work but it's
definitely fairly slow work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is I like to create a
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it all into a pile so it's together
and then I like to card it nice and slow
[SPEAKER_00]: and hard over the screen, keeping sure
that you clean the card always.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is once again low quality resin so
it's not gumming up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about that but say this
was Max from The Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: That barb is a very, very tricky resin and
you've got to be very careful when you
[SPEAKER_00]: card it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact I could almost guarantee that I
would not be able to card the barb in this
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually have to go and do it in a colder
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I've carded quite a bit of
that resin through the screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: just even in the couple of minutes that
I've been talking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there's very few heads in
this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just add a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the slow process of taking that
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I've got a nice little pile
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little pile of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about five minutes of carding,
I'll turn that nice little pile of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move that for you so the light's shining
down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it a little better without the
shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move that shadow out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, give you a nice better view of
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often ask, do I need the big
screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I say to them is the more surface
area, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how with just that tiny little bit
of resin, I just covered a huge chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the tiniest piece of screen
to do your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have room and that's why
often people think that these screens are
[SPEAKER_00]: only for an industrial or a huge grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so if you have three or four grams of
dry sift to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it over these screens quite
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we've got some hairs in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll also realize as you're
working that there's parts of the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: that will stay cleaner than other parts of
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is generally we work
in the middle of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have the majority of your
resin is going to get trapped in this
[SPEAKER_00]: section of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I'm carding and I'm finding
that it's not really picking the heads on
[SPEAKER_00]: top, it's not really pushing everything
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's keeping everything on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take everything over to the corner
and I'll get into this sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear how it's a different sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because these corners of the
screens are notoriously much cleaner than
[SPEAKER_00]: the center because I'm always working on
the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your resin isn't super,
super sticky, you'll be able to card it
[SPEAKER_00]: much the way I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're dealing with some extremely
high-end resin, you're going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you've got to card softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things to look for,
and this is a really important tip while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're carding, if you can see right now I
have a nice clean resin bed I've laid down
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows me to find my contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much easier by bringing it to the surface
like these little hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows me to look for grooves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're carding, as the resin
heats up, it's going to want to melt to
[SPEAKER_00]: your card and it creates these little
balls of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little balls of resin will create
little pathways in your resin as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: carding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're carding and you don't see these
smooth lines, but you see instead pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: in them almost like little roadways,
you need to lift up your card and you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean it with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bits that you clean need to go into
the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want those bits going back into
your resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make it literally impossible to
clean the rest of the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your card clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you I'll have another hour before I
push all this shit through this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to record the whole thing,
but I'll come back here and there as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting down on the bag and getting the
resin piles a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a pile of just pure heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's probably not just pure heads,
but it's pure as it's going to be with
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll macro that for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dropped a little pile of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll end up with the heads on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll end up with some shwaggle underneath
and I'll come back and I'll show you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: the piles and I'll show you maybe another
little clip or two of just this process of
[SPEAKER_00]: carding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any questions,
please ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this to be as simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to apply pressure differently
depending on the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much like water hash when you're
wicking out moisture at the end right
[SPEAKER_00]: before you're getting ready to sieve or
microplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the subtle nuances that give
people difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things that make people want
to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the unknowns because they change
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try to be ready for them,
but you just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on the quality of your resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you purify resin, depending on its
quality, it's going to act a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've given you most of what I need
to tell you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue on here and card
this resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see already, if you guys want to
have a quick little gander, that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: already pushed quite a bit through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do the one arm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the pile right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an enormous amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amount of contaminant that's in
this material, like I said, maybe 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nasty hairs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure someone somewhere thinks this is
great, but I assure you it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to cleaning a lot more of this
powder out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already been at it for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be at it for quite a while
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that back on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be back in a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to do a little bit more
cleaning, come back and show you what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done, take some macro photos, and we'll be
done part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry it wasn't a higher grade resin,
but you know what I'm thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing everyone the highest grade
resins and the cleanest that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that we need to start a
little bit more at the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the base of the audience, of everyone,
because we don't all start with the best
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not go over something that's a little
bit less than awesome and show how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get it a little closer to something really
nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst case scenario, once I've cleaned
this out, if it's still unsmokable and has
[SPEAKER_00]: a terrible taste, we'll do a coconut oil
extraction and we'll get that resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get those cannabinoids into a system
and we'll make them worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got my clean piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to turn them too much,
but basically this guy right here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, he's sort of almost the darker
one, but that one is the firsts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here is the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second piled into one pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, last but certainly not least,
often you'll have a little bit of resin on
[SPEAKER_00]: your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, so rather than lose that,
just brush it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good idea to clean your screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also take this one outside and I'll
bang it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll loosen anything that's sort of
stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what we're going to do is go
into the original bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually go into the original bag that I
was given the product with, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: schwaggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we have no shortage of
schwaggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the majority of what that sift
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose is so itchy from having it in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish literally everything in my office
is covered in resin right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My crop is covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My desk is covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're always going to end up with
most, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unless I'm cleaning someone like
Matt from The Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got a really nice percentage of
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally in his sift I can get,
he usually gives it to me and it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say this was less than 5% heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially the lowest head content I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a little way out and we'll
see exactly what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end here, this is when I usually
get the brush really working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to pick up as nice as a
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sorry, a card is never going to pick up
as nice as a brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brush just basically gets every drop
of resin off the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you can use anything you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use cardboard because this is schwagg
and I don't care about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use glass or you want to
use a plexiglass, you're welcome to catch
[SPEAKER_00]: your catch with whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be heavy and it tends to
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to carry my screens around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take these screens with me when
I go on trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have seen me traveling through
the airport with this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always take it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are left with a bag of talcum
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost the original size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are left with our couple of piles
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do a little macrophotography,
show you what we got here in each pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be super impressive,
but I want to show you guys and let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we are dealing with and what we
have to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might even take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have resin all over me, which is,
you know, it's something that the bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: man deals with on a regular basis,
covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what we're really what's left
to do is have a bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got some of my fresh frozen Astro
Boy right here, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stoked on this fresh frozen Astro Boy
that I grew with my my Medi One,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been asking me about
Medi One.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's what I've been growing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it through Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got it sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have it on my website soon
because so many people are asking me and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always liked selling things that I
believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it just makes good sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people ask me what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using Medi One and yeah, good old
Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for watching Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope these tips have helped you guys
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show a lot of the carding because
the carding is boring and it's a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be not carding like this,
OK, but carding like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to bend that card down and you
want to use some of the surface area on
[SPEAKER_00]: the card to push those contaminants
through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot easier when you
have a low grade material and you just see
[SPEAKER_00]: everything disappear through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really what you want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see some things bouncing
around and you want to see that resin
[SPEAKER_00]: going from almost like a fibrous planty
material to a grainy, sandy material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get those fibers and those
capitate stalks and systolic hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: that cellulose material and once you break
that through the screen, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be left on top with these almost little
stone ball rock type things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the glandular trichome
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that when you get your
purity up above 80 and 90%, that pile will
[SPEAKER_00]: change drastically, even to the naked eye
of the trained hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here we have quite a few piles,
you know, more than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, all of them combined were what
the Sift was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first showed you in part one,
cleaning out this crazy carpet-like
[SPEAKER_00]: material that is, I don't even think
capitate stalks or systolic hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's another type of hair that is
non-cannabis that has contaminated this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy's batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what kind of hair it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked at it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, after that, what I did was,
I pushed everything through about 100
[SPEAKER_00]: micron screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up with, well, it was the 107.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 107.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up with this on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the bottom tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the bunk, or it was the bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up with these on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the same grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like 107 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put everything on top of a 70
micron screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about as clean as I could get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has little hairs and tiny little
pieces of contaminant that just seemingly
[SPEAKER_00]: were impossible to clean out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't dabbed it, per se, but it's not
really acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when I do this with, say,
mats, the whole thing would pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't break like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be already stuck together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with this one over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all the piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this with your two screen kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be left with these piles and
this pile all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with your four screens kits
that I sell, the wooden kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one of the wooden frames just to run
it through super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was made really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was the one that took all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is, your grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst, the second worst, the second
best, the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
See you next time.
