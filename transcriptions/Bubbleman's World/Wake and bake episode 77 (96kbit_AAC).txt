[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up everybody welcome to the
wake and bake episode 77 that's seven and
[SPEAKER_01]: seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a palindrome actually forwards and
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I hope everyone's doing great
today We're just in the chat room talking
[SPEAKER_01]: with sticks with turps Scott ray Detroit
bubble boy We're talking about the cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: hash We're talking about you know trying
to get bubble man brand really wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the price of hash down in,
California It's hard because the shops you
[SPEAKER_01]: sell to obviously are doubling the price
on the hash and you see these extravagant
[SPEAKER_01]: over $100 sometimes over $200 prices,
which That's a little bit of a kick in the
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of a kick in the newts for
someone especially if this is your your
[SPEAKER_01]: your medicine that you're purchasing I
Agreed anandamide the rent is too damn
[SPEAKER_01]: high and the hash is too damn Hi Hope
everyone's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't seem to get this working,
but it seems like we're on live here My
[SPEAKER_01]: youtube video won't go live on my
computer, but I see you guys so obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see me Yeah rocking a little DNA
always happy to support Aaron and dawn and
[SPEAKER_01]: of course Crockett good people good people
I haven't seen them for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say last time I saw Aaron was
probably when he was out here for New
[SPEAKER_01]: Year's came out for New Year's with his
family and we hung out with him and As
[SPEAKER_01]: well as flab 421 and his family and even
the great garden Was up with his
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriend Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's videos you guys can go check it
out I just don't get why it won't show me
[SPEAKER_01]: not that I really need to as long as I can
see the The chat then we're good to go
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 930.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't stream at any particular time
Gavin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go when I want to go I like to build up
the room a little bit have you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in here and chatting and creating
a conversation It always seems to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: great way Let's hope for 2017 to be the
year that we see the prices Of hash go
[SPEAKER_01]: down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really really nice to see I'm
gonna turn on the Dabinator NSEW live East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast what's going on Jedi surfer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiki meow and stoner smurf and intrepid
chronics and mechanic guide Got a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: crew in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were slowly converting me to
solventless, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what Nick?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all up to you to do your own
decisions I'm not trying to direct you any
[SPEAKER_01]: one way, but I have my own directions and
I'm passionate About them and hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on Aaron?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Heavy ice is in the room I haven't
seen you in here for a while buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to nice to see ya I hope life is
treating you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm Probably gonna rip into some of
this dry sift or some of this dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure this one's d420 case It's
a little bit darker og Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from the Guys at sunrise
wellness and I can't remember the name of
[SPEAKER_01]: it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's It's definitely not the petroleum
headstache crossed with the Malawi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just the jar that he gave it to
me Alright, I will go for the light one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go for the light one It's funny
because you know Tony said something the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day when he was talking to someone
about rosin and there is sort of this
[SPEAKER_01]: Minor negative attention that gets put on
the darker resins and I'm not sure why
[SPEAKER_01]: that is I as well love a clear Golden as
light colored as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems to have something that is
more and I when it's When it comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: darker, I just feel like it's not quite as
good and I'm not sure why that is It's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be hash racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure But I do prefer a golden a
golden color All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grab a little dabble here It's
aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I don't think it's oh nine cookies
for some reason, but maybe it is I really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of forgot maybe it is the oh nine
cookies I forget Oh nice heavy eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll love to see that and I've had
some delicious dark rosin don't get me
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong But for the most part, I'm usually a
little bit happier when it comes out Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean, we're talking about
color we're talking about you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's it's it's a strange thing because
the dark Resin the dark bubble for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: can be absolute fire I find particularly
in tropical countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble will often go darker just from
the oxidization and the heat I saw It in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain the last time I was there really
really beautiful dark ambers almost reds
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know deeply twisted oranges just
beautiful hash Right on Kaylee don't be
[SPEAKER_01]: late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be sorry right on Kaylee's mom I
hope you guys are all having a good good
[SPEAKER_01]: day puffing bowls over there Yeah for sure
me too Cuban me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Do remember when the West Coast boys
rosin that ten-year-old bubble I brought
[SPEAKER_01]: that ten-year-old bubble to them so they
could rosin it that was a very nice thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to have done for Steve because
Those guys are connoisseurs and let me
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you they were not Too stoked on the
quality of that end product, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure David It might be the oh
nine cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the last sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean this is so old at this point in
time I wasn't puffing it for the longest
[SPEAKER_01]: time but It is full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drips and bubbles into a liquid and is
definitely on point for that Just waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: for my D nail to keep to heat up a little
bit and We'll have a rip with you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a good price 35 euros, you know,
I'd love to even see it cheaper but It's
[SPEAKER_01]: tough paying these insane prices when you
can just that's why a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: happy to grow their own You know what
sticks with turps I have no idea I talked
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cookie fan guys and they were just
like oh nine cookies What the fuck that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't even make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suspect it's one of these things
situations where a name got named
[SPEAKER_01]: something and I kind of feel bad every
time I say the name because I know Jiga
[SPEAKER_01]: and flux are cringing in there in their
Surroundings of true cookies, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is How much is decent hash in
Jamaica decent hash is very hard to find
[SPEAKER_01]: in Jamaica But you could probably pay
about 20 plus dollars for a gram I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard that some of the co2 oil and such is
going for 50 and 60 dollars a gram on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the nicer In the nicer hotels should we
get this going on now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's fire but I'm just not
sure if it's actually cookies so this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing right we really need to get
people like to name things things and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just rip it
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was really nice, you know what
I love about properly cured dry sift It's
[SPEAKER_01]: so smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't dry sift Dry sift that was
taken fresh and put in a vac freezer and
[SPEAKER_01]: had moisture This is properly dried and
cured and processed dry sift and because
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just absolutely smooth I'm gonna take
one twice as big as that Because that one
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted just like another
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can can a guy but it depends on
what your definition of trim If you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce full melt from trim it better
be proper trim I'm talking about the tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: little pieces of from the bud that you cut
clip away not the Large fan leaves maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: small fan leaves like that if they have
resin all over them But all the first
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble I made back in the day was absolute
absolutely made from trim and once I got
[SPEAKER_01]: the growers trained to producing the trim
that I required which was really generally
[SPEAKER_01]: simply put when the resin when the leaf
has no resin put it in this pile when it
[SPEAKER_01]: has sugar exactly sugar leaves over to the
right and you know everything else over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the left and I don't know Horta matte for
25 I've sold a couple here and there maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: four So you can absolutely get incredible
quality from trim It's it's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are some trims that still will have
this minorly like I'll sometimes I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh did you make this from trim like
I'll taste that Hey that really really a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people won't taste it But I'll
sometimes taste it and I think it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot to do with the terpene profile of the
plant Renee for instance The trim made
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble that was as nice as tasty as
quality As the bud and so that was a very
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing thing now other cultivars did
not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes the grass taste I can really taste the
grass taste in dry sift made from trim if
[SPEAKER_01]: you use trim and make dry sift Unless you
clean it to 99.999.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna taste that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey in there just a little bit Let's have
another big rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall we it actually had really nice
effects like it got me really really
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoned not gonna lie Let's have another
shall we Trying to get a big one it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's a pretty big one If it will let
me oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's twice the size,
but it's big It's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for smoking pot That's a very
good idea
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was really nice on top of my
second one it really finally grabbed me
[SPEAKER_01]: and was like I'm going in again
[SPEAKER_01]: This was made from bud
[SPEAKER_01]: Well as it should I'm hitting beautiful
dry sift This often sends people reeling a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people aren't really Used to the
puff that a full melt dry sift will give
[SPEAKER_01]: you It's not going to be the same as
pretty much any other concentrate unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you're smoking really unique cultivars
that produce, you know, the alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble terpenes that Don't wash away in
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some really What's the key to
dry sifting buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think there is any one key I
think that's why it's a difficult and
[SPEAKER_01]: complex thing and most people are unable
to do it carding allowed a very few People
[SPEAKER_01]: to get on board once Mies discovered that
he could wrap his card with parchment that
[SPEAKER_01]: created the static edition Darren added
the DVD and then other people went with
[SPEAKER_01]: books and wider things to create a wider
edge along the bottom and now you have You
[SPEAKER_01]: know people producing 99% dry sift that
was otherwise You know They weren't they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't pulling it off quite with cards I
was able to get to 99.999% with carding
[SPEAKER_01]: only because I was so obsessed and I would
card for hours Sometimes first time we
[SPEAKER_01]: carded just a couple of rips Johnny B and
I the first time he I did it with him to
[SPEAKER_01]: show him I had been doing it for a while
at that point in time, maybe ten years It
[SPEAKER_01]: took 40 minutes just to produce one really
Yeah One, you know beautiful rip each and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's also on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 2020 2012 video of rip and dry
sift with Johnny B and I love the video
[SPEAKER_01]: because at the end of the video actually
I'm gonna show you the video because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so fucking awesome dry sift Dry that's
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure dry sift rips YouTube I don't
know the exact name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oh full melt dry sift No, oh here it is
dry sift after 40 minutes of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get you guys a little
show here
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is me and Johnny B smoking his
hash that I cleaned up Got it all melty Oh
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Little beeline ripping little beeline
ripping Not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best part is the laugh at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're just showing the purity
here You know, this is really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: now when Johnny B came over with this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 20% heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember him being excited about it we
had just met and I said listen this is
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers grade and he kind of was a little
insulted and Then I just we just cleaned
[SPEAKER_01]: it and Johnny B never looked back from
that day forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a full melt hasher Yeah,
and this is dry sift that I cleaned right
[SPEAKER_01]: here in my office right here in my office
I cleaned it so it's starting to char up
[SPEAKER_01]: finally and we're just trying to finish it
This was this rip took like 20 rips Listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to the laugh when I exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so awesome It's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to exhale and blow up
[SPEAKER_01]: The char be the wax membranes the fibrous
matte the you know, the material that's
[SPEAKER_01]: left over from the gland that isn't oil so
Pretty fun good laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah giggling like a schoolgirl Well,
you know, that's funny that you should ask
[SPEAKER_01]: is there any way to make a distillate
without a solvent because That's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're working on right now Trying to
create a distillate from rosin and without
[SPEAKER_01]: using a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us get back to you on that one
Yeah, Indra who made me laugh to you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you see that rip We had set it up
and what you don't see off camera is that
[SPEAKER_01]: no one person smoked that whole bowl John
and I were both going like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd hit it He'd hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hit it He hit it it got so ridiculous
that at the end we were almost unable to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish The bowl and I was I kept trying to
and right at the end when I finish it I
[SPEAKER_01]: just I it all blows out and I just had to
bust into laughter it was It was quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: rip even for the two of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a rip and I will say that we both
felt quite wonderful It also obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: made us feel really good for John It was a
profound revelation because he was in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of pain at that point in time and he
was using cannabis for his pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he had never acquired that clean or
pure of a product and it was his own resin
[SPEAKER_01]: and the thing about John is He grows great
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just didn't know how to process it when
I met him And so when I took his resin and
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaned it and saw that it melted like
that I was like, alright, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this next thing, you know,
I Basically said to him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what about bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you try bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, oh, I've never really been
Impressed with bubble and so, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did was basically Go over to his place
and whip up a batch of his material make a
[SPEAKER_01]: make a batch for him and It was
unbelievable quality once again who what
[SPEAKER_01]: are we going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why why is this guy like?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what that dude's deal
is, but he's got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah bubble ambassadors So going there and
making bubble at his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was kind of like I've made bubble I'm
not really that impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, maybe you were doing it
the way you were dry sifting So he was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, yeah, maybe I was I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ran the eight bags we produced some
absolutely stellar product and Once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that those are the things that he
identifies himself by now his dry sifting
[SPEAKER_01]: and his bubble hashing so hats off to
Johnny B For you know growing the good
[SPEAKER_01]: resin and making the good making the good
isolates Yeah, great God is really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the hash I've had the rosin very
nice I love using your saying whenever
[SPEAKER_01]: someone has poop soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say BH.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Horta Matt Well, that's a good good
way to go about it if it's poop soup,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Difference between solvent free
and solventless there is no difference
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Lutz because there's no such thing
even though I myself have fallen victim to
[SPEAKER_01]: it There's no such thing as solventless
when it comes to cannabis because all the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbons that are the terpenes are
solvents, so How do you call it
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like if you want to say it's
it's you You know, it's not made using
[SPEAKER_01]: petrochemical based solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could say something like that
Petrochemical based solvents or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's definitely they are still
solvents the the terpenes are solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are hydrocarbons That's why whole
ratio could take the terpene d limonene
[SPEAKER_01]: and make oil with it instead of you know
Running butane through the tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: He runs d limonene through the tube and he
gets his extract Well, it means that the
[SPEAKER_01]: The solvent they used has all been cleaned
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they that's what they mean But
for me the solvent is never really the big
[SPEAKER_01]: worry It's whatever heavy metal
contaminant could be potentially laying in
[SPEAKER_01]: the solvent that is you know or Pesticide
worse say the solvent is clean as clean
[SPEAKER_01]: can be but you end up getting material
that is late laden with Pesticides those
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides will have very similar
molecular weights as the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you run It through a short path
molecular distillation unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to have concentrated
with that oil all those pesticides So yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: petrochemical free extracts, you know that
that's that's probably a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate Bubble hash turns dark depending
on the oils inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it stays very bright I've had
stuff bubble hash be very blonde be very
[SPEAKER_01]: red Generally, it's oxidization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if I keep it I've got some Here
that looks almost black It really depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on how I let it get exposed but if I make
a very and then also the life cycle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome like people now Love the light
golden color So we'll end up and also
[SPEAKER_01]: people love cutting their herb down early
so they can get it sold and they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: paid faster a combination of those two
things really does create a very light
[SPEAKER_01]: colored resin if you take that light
colored resin and keep it in a fridge or a
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer it's pretty much going to Stay
preserved it's not going to get very dark
[SPEAKER_01]: To a degree Connor But it depends on how
cold you keep the water and how fast you
[SPEAKER_01]: can wash it because a lot like for me I
wash fast I'm not about mixing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: taking my sweet time pulling the bags in a
perfect world You'd have four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and you'd all pull those bags all
simultaneously get the water out right
[SPEAKER_01]: away You know, you don't want it to be
there any longer than it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: So No, I mean like I said, you know I love
properly cured resin and often properly
[SPEAKER_01]: cured resin is not light in color when I
you know Some of the best resin I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked in my life was fairly dark in color
reddish dark But much darker than blonde
[SPEAKER_01]: or you know, this sort of beige color that
I've got going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Smells good though when I leave the
lids off of these dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like turquoise Terp heaven it fills
up the entire room with this beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene laden smell Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, how do I feel about storing flour
in a fridge or freezer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well It'll it'll it'll it'll suck out
moisture unless you can really seal it
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just it'll remove the moisture
That's what it'll do the moisture will try
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave the bud go on the inside of the
bag and then the process of the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving the bud and then getting
reabsorbed to me turns Bud into hay and so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an overly big fan of it,
especially in that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure terpenes are being affected even
though it's cold There's still an
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporation happening Put a chest freezing
for long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there it is If you want a vacuum,
that's definitely the better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want any room between that herb
and that Who knows what the ideal curing
[SPEAKER_01]: temp is that's something you're gonna want
to find out For you know for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to preserve, you know, you know
terpenes, but I also like to Evaporate out
[SPEAKER_01]: the most caustic ones that are a little
bit harsher on the throat when you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cut it fresh frozen and you wash
it right away and you keep it fresh Cold
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole time you get a very more of a
harsh sort of grab you by the nuts rip a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people like that I myself prefer a
little bit more of a smooth Rip,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if I'm gonna take 40 or 50 of
them in a day Nitrogen storage would be
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long term if you wanted to remove
the oxygen and replace it with nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure That's gonna preserve much longer
than oxygen would Yeah, all right grab you
[SPEAKER_01]: by the short and curlies well Hetty riff I
used to do fresh frozen I was all about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found was it was like a cheat
It was like a way that could this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could learn how to Say this is
gonna be a really good drop if I can
[SPEAKER_01]: figure this out Bubble bags are a guide
they guide you in growing and so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to them They will take you to a
place where you can give that plant What
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to express itself to the maximum
of its potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay now what I mean by that is How to
really explain it how to really explain it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it this is this Is so I I don't want
to get lost in my thoughts, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a this is an important factor
Properly drying the resin, okay Would we
[SPEAKER_01]: ever smoke fresh herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's harsh It hurts our throats
because those caustic terpenes the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that are evaporating out at room
temperature I'm not sure we're supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be inhaling those ones and those are the
ones that people are trying to Save to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher terpene production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Used to make bubble with trim that was
bone dropping And that bubble came out
[SPEAKER_01]: six-star.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Renee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that it can be done I know that
the nicest bubble can be made from from
[SPEAKER_01]: dried cured bud and to this day I still
prefer it and I see that You know if your
[SPEAKER_01]: bud is grown to the maximum of its
potential and you You and you dry and cure
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you take that dry and cured
material and you make bubble hash with it
[SPEAKER_01]: It will melt into a liquid now the problem
is most people Is material most people
[SPEAKER_01]: that make fresh frozen if you dry their
material and you make bubble with it It
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't melt anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the melting factor has more to do with
the wax Membrane and the moisture content
[SPEAKER_01]: of that membrane boiling out when you hit
the hash then an actual melt factor So
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a little bit like oh,
I didn't listen to the bags I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting it fresh frozen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, dude People like how do you use
dry material and still get it to melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's called Growing great pot
look into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what the bags have been trying to
tell you but you're ignoring them and
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately when I started releasing the
bags the BHO method came out immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: like a month later and a lot of people
would try the bags and then be like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: that shits not that good which really was
telling them your shits not that good and
[SPEAKER_01]: they would just instead of Growing better
herb they would go make oil and the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing's happening with rosin people are
making a meltable product out of something
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not meltable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course it melts its oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You melted the glands off the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be as impressive as hash
Melting hash melting is impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you grew that plant to absolute
perfection and then you purified those
[SPEAKER_01]: glands to perfection if you can do both
those things Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody loves anything more than that and
just very few people have it It's it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: rarity to have full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some for instance, but the problem
Is both of these were not grown to
[SPEAKER_01]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not grown to perfection I would
say it's a seven out of ten and this one
[SPEAKER_01]: was not grown to perfection It might be a
seven point five out of ten now Keep in
[SPEAKER_01]: mind for the most part because so many
people now are used to just blasting
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so used to not seeing quality that
a seven is the new ten which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Unfortunate when we're in an era
where we know the importance of this
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and we would think that the
highest quality would be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important for us whether we are sick or
whether we are healthy and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent So that's what I wanted to say
about that The bubble bags are a guide if
[SPEAKER_01]: you run your material through bubble bags
and it does not come out melty and
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful and tasty and wonderful Then
you're not doing something right and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bags have told you so please listen to
them listen to them and go back and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from it learn about maybe creating a
living soil maybe Look into those strains
[SPEAKER_01]: of bacteria for the roots that can produce
healthier happier plants all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things Alan Mota the best thing
you can do if you can get material from
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else Run their material for them
and give it to them and show them look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a C plus at best you just passed
Maybe it's even a D some might be a D some
[SPEAKER_01]: are C plus some are B's some are B pluses
but very very very few are A pluses
[SPEAKER_01]: because the A pluses They just find they
get gobbled up so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you that much How crucial is
the drying process if you're using grade A
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well fairly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could fuck it up to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the highest quality flowers I can
tell you The product always melts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but curing is gonna be
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've grown this thing to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You purified it to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're done everything Right why fuck it
up at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: One way to fuck it up at the end that a
lot of people would do is they would put
[SPEAKER_01]: it all together I would say use it put it
on a desiccant and sieve it so it breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: into powder They would still powder it all
into a pile like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see it piled into a pile I
want to see little specks spread very thin
[SPEAKER_01]: over the desiccant over the cardboard
because that is what's going to pull the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture out properly another thing I see
is when people start to feel the hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: they say oh, it's kind of I think it's dry
now It's it's it's really dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't it's it's it's a it's a trick the
outside is dry but the inside is not and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll go and they'll rub it all together
and make a ball and Of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're gonna end up with this
buttered out kind of, you know Falling
[SPEAKER_01]: apart hash that ends up smelling of that
sort of funky moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we saw in the early days
Mostly my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed a lot of people incorrectly how
to make how to how to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: put bubble together afterwards and I spent
years Trying to explain the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: removing all of the moisture content So
keep in mind when I started showing this
[SPEAKER_01]: to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one was really making medical isolates
for patients It was a very new thing and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think most people were producing it for
personal use It was a personal use thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and now we've gotten to a point where it's
turning commercial and Now we've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: change up the tools a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I Dried out for 10 to 15,
but I'm in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, generally you could probably
hit that same Range in about three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: days in a in a in a dry place like Arizona
or something Well, you know what drew I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not fussy I don't grow all my cannabis and
I I don't pretend to think that one way is
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the other as I get older I
realized that a quiver is an important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing because it gives us options and I
know that I feel Different on different
[SPEAKER_01]: days and I have different months and weeks
of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would I want to have only one
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: To take me to take care of me when it
comes to cannabis There are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful options and that's why I always
say I don't fight against anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: already exists I just fight for more
That's the way to do it Yeah Possible for
[SPEAKER_01]: a hash maybe like four to five percent
terping content to make a hash that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't butter up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be hard to say Dan Richards I
couldn't really say it's possible The
[SPEAKER_01]: terping content might very well just be
too high and when you concentrate that
[SPEAKER_01]: much hash it very well may butter itself
out We know that terpenes can butter out
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that moisture content can butter
out hash at the same time I've had very
[SPEAKER_01]: terpy hash that I've managed to dry
properly now keeping in mind drying
[SPEAKER_01]: properly is I Think it could take a couple
of months sometimes to hang a plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it prepared for dry sifting So those
those little heads shrink like little
[SPEAKER_01]: resins and you just know that all that's
really in there is that resin head sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna lose some of your terpenes
and your weight, but The smoothness of
[SPEAKER_01]: that smoke and the watching it melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I'll tell you anyone I ever put that
in their bowl the impressive they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: believe they can get that high Without
coughing and turning red, you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn cough and turn red You're
gonna get maybe one or two rips of that
[SPEAKER_01]: smooth and by the time you take your
second or third you're gonna be like
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just unbelievably pure and if
it's properly grown then that's even
[SPEAKER_01]: better That's for sure Well excellent Octo
Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want it to be a good one We're
gonna have another one tomorrow another
[SPEAKER_01]: one Friday and hopefully another one on
Saturday morning So we will see you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: all sooner than later and as I always like
to finish it as I've already said the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, but May the full melt bless your
bowl sooner than later Peace out everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: You You You
