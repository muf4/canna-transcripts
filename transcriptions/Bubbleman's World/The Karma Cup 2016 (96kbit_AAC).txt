[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my good friend Sarah Sunday,
the founder of the Karma Cup, which I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess we're going on year three now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year three, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year three, that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to kind of get a little update on
what's going on, what's planned,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dates, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought what better way for Sarah
and I to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some beautiful West Coast
concentrate bubble hash here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, some lovely heavenly days,
rosin, both sweet skunk and Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did promise we would start out with
the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what better way to really get into
a conversation about a cannabis festival?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what we should call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, cannabis festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be limited in your thinking,
thinking that the Karma Cup is just a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might have been a misnomer in the
early days of naming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Karma Cup is going to be much more
than a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not saying that a cannabis cup is a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful thing when it's done
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be an exciting experience to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going to them for 25 years
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this day and age, it's nice to see
the sort of educational factor and more
[SPEAKER_01]: factors being taken into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than just, let's get a bunch of
people that love pot, get them into a
[SPEAKER_01]: small room, judging, give some trophies
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking on all the aspects of
cannabis culture and celebrating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm really kind of looking forward
to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be on October.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's October 22nd and 23rd in Toronto,
which is the weekend before Halloween,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of harvest festival time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can bring the goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good timing, actually, in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people should pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also there's less going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like a perfect time to get a
crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't had a smoke out in months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's looking to have a good
time and get together again.
[SPEAKER_01]: My God, does this resin, has it ever taken
on a nice texture in the sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel that we should do ladies
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, my mom taught me well.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom taught me well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually using this as a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits so perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you really have to be
careful of is because there's resin in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it'll melt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll melt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was giving me endless rips the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over with Brett and I was just like,
I was like, man, I can't seem to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: this hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, bro, look in your jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had all this freeze dried bubble
that had melted down the sides and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: coalesced around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to take half of that or a third
of it or all of it, whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be dabbing here for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no need to get completely zombified
before we get our message out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost left Sarah hanging there on the car
while I was yammering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys notice that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone will be posting, put the carb cap
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, come on, man, bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the sweet skunk's so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hella tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, like, tell us, tell us a little
bit about, I guess, you know, maybe let's
[SPEAKER_01]: start from the beginning, how the Karma
Cup started, because it really was not
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I would say happened
naturally, it seemed like you were really
[SPEAKER_01]: like a force behind it saying this is
happening.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: While other people were like, I don't
think it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember when how all that
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did get to be at the first Karma
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bonus because I was heading to
Jamaica anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just happened to be in town for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like, tell us how it sort of
started, the thought of developing a cup
[SPEAKER_01]: and then how the cup evolved into a
festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to kind of lead us up to where we're
going to be in the next couple of months
[SPEAKER_01]: when it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so my reasoning behind creating the
festival, well, not even the festival,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start at the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cup is as a grower, I wanted to get
more value out of the competitions I was
[SPEAKER_00]: entering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thing is I want to give the growers
as much promotion as I can for their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have like profile online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take professional pictures of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We post them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We post them on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you links.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than just the possibility of
winning a trophy and winning some bragging
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some lasting value behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically started that trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always frustrated that I'd find out
about high times or some cup happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you couldn't even find pictures
or any information about the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, how useful is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all this value.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all this content that could be
creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to maximize our content and
create a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of value for everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm also all about getting a good pack
of contestants for these judges to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go around to all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody I know that's a grower or
producer has a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like twisting their arm behind
their back and saying, you have the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a lot going on and
everything, but hey, we really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's worked out really well for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made their brands off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like we're giving value to the
judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving value to the competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're making it bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making it so that you don't have to
just buy a judges pack to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy, even if you're on a low income or a
disability issue or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is always an issue for some,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it should be a person's choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you want to just come in for the
weekend, it's like 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super cheap, really accessible to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it can be afforded basically by
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also level like, you know,
if you've got a wheelchair or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you can get in and all my
other, basically everything else was
[SPEAKER_00]: upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's accessible to all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price is accessible to all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got festival amenities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got like live glass blowing,
five torches going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a live visual art show with lots
of graffiti art and other kinds of visual
[SPEAKER_00]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all those artists, the glass
artists and the visual artists selling
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a glass marketplace and an
artisan marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple different vendor areas
for different types of booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a medication zone for patients
where there'll be like extract artists and
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and dispensaries located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a medic, another tent that's
like a 6,000 square foot medication tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor village type tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got, we can, we're just going to
have a large vapor area in there plus six
[SPEAKER_00]: booths that face onto it, pretty prime
booths, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that space is going to be
chairs, like about a hundred chairs for
[SPEAKER_00]: our speaker stage, which normal is working
with me on the speaker stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're programming some interesting
panels to actually really get into issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going on in cannabis in Canada
today and our industry and broadening and
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading more information to everybody
that might be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a big, a big plus and bonus
because that's, that's what gives the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that ability to, you know,
they can go and see all the other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like, you can really take
something back when you see someone speak
[SPEAKER_01]: at one of these events where it's
inspirational knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot believe that you're hearing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the knowledge I'm talking
about would be, you know, any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical sort of miracles that people call
miracles, but are really sort of described
[SPEAKER_01]: as simple endocannabinoid deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important to have that aspect
of the education for your audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm definitely glad that you're doing,
doing a speaker stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we want to get all the aspects
in there, you know, we've got the fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got some education, we've got
various types of fun, various types of
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some good food trucks coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really using that as an income
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to provide excellent food
for the people that are involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what a bonus, you know, when,
and I think that the fact that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: coming at this from a, from a like,
Oh, I've been in marketing for 15 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and I always liked herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I would put the two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that you're coming from the,
it's like, well, I'm a grower because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, I met you as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, before the karma cup,
you were Sarah, the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's your perspective that you're
coming at it from like, Oh, I'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: see one of these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, give more to the growers
because that's who I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of like going around and
bitching about how all the other cups
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't doing that, you created your own
from a grower perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to an October 22nd and
23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be there probably under my
bubble man brand and the blue river
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, we haven't discussed
exactly what's going to go on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I suspect that there will be some sort
of a terpene tasting booth and maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get some terpene champagne, some terpene
made up for the events, but it should be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely looking forward to coming
and seeing it's always nice to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, who in that community is
representing at this particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I like to go to most of the events,
whether it's, you know, an event for LPs
[SPEAKER_01]: or an event for doctors or an event for,
for, for extractors or an event for
[SPEAKER_01]: growers or an event that covers many of
those things, which I'm, I'm really more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a quiver guy these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out, it was like, Oh,
all he does is he smokes bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, no, that's not
really true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I also like dry sift and I also now
like rosin and I, I like to expand and
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, the quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to have a bunch of these in here
rather than just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think that for a while,
this is what cups were and then slowly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but surely we're seeing, you know,
like cannabis can bring a lot to the table
[SPEAKER_01]: so much so that it can dilute you in
anything that you do if you focus on too
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 15 categories this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, yeah, I've got, I added two
more bud categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to list them all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm forgetting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did just take a giant dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's more than two hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts becoming problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, uh, so for the bud,
we've got Indica sativa hybrid CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, um, shattered like the solvent
extract shatter Indica sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butter, um, TFC distillate solvent lists,
um, vapor pen, disposable pen,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, edible topical and functional glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trophies are all, um, handmade by
Patrick in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like the hillbilly glassblower that
lives in the, in the, in the, in the bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's like my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could completely live in the bush in a
cabin and be as happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I kind of do, except my cabin's a
little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really nice cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still live in the bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got coyotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me the last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coyotes and cougars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had big black bears on the deck.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in nature here for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the country, but I don't get that
quite amount of wildlife on my,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get deer that like to come up and eat my
tomatoes out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should talk a little bit more about
the cup in regards to, um, tickets for
[SPEAKER_01]: people that want to come and just spend a
day or want to spend two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to enter or people that do
want to enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go through the cost of all the
different ways that you can participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there, uh, we'll start out with the
easiest way to get involved, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: general admission ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get either, um, a one day
ticket or a weekend pass off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: website, which is www.thecarmacup.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's just a buy tickets button on
the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's through Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you buy it right on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the next way you can get involved is
by either entering or judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an application for judges on the,
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the Karma Cup.com really easy
again, button on the front page apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we go through and basically just make
sure that you're, um, can handle the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity and have the ability and,
uh, experience or we're looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad range of different types of people,
but, um, especially medical patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who really consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a tough job taking like,
you know, the first year I had 80 entries
[SPEAKER_00]: and the second year I had a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, um, oh, entering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I guess the third way to get
involved is if you're a grower or
[SPEAKER_00]: producer, baker, um, topical maker,
some type of cannabis product manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: you can enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year I'm limiting the cat,
the number of entries to two per category
[SPEAKER_00]: except for edible, which will be one per
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got full details online about,
um, the, the amounts, uh, different
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, www.thecarmacup.com slash entry
dash information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's again, a link right off the main
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people out there for a grower that
might be watching all these YouTube videos
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing all these different characters,
you get Remo and John Berfalo and D420K
[SPEAKER_01]: and bubble man and all of these different
people that you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can go to an event like this
and the majority of them could be the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you're competing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to see how well you
stand in the, in the game, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: show people that you're a great grower and
kind of get that word out, cause everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: believes they're a great grower,
but it's definitely a little bit nicer
[SPEAKER_01]: when a whole bunch of other people agree
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a trophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a little thing and then it's a
recognized thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely for people that are
trying to get jobs in the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're trying to get their herb
picked up by a dispensary or they're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get a job with a dispensary,
it's not, believe it or not, going to hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: you to have a Karma Cup win on your
resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, I should, the last thing I should
mention is that the, the date I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: need it in our hands is September 8th,
which is really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end of next week, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in entering,
there's a link off the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter the Karma Cup and we just ask you
for the information and get back to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to get it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're there's enter any one of the
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds pretty simplistic for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you guys watching bubble man's
world, uh, enter something in the solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: list category as I would love to check it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not by any means a judge, but I'm sure
that I am a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me you would guess judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I am sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a guest judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want me to judge your material,
then I would love to see it show up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Toronto at the Karma Cup for October 22nd
and 23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you heard her September 8th or
9th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 8th September 8th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get your bags going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sift might be a better short than
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many different beautiful ways to
enter solvent list nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do suggest that if you really want,
if you have something incredible in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift or bubble hash range that,
uh, there's just so few people really at
[SPEAKER_01]: that level that enter these cups that,
uh, it's definitely it's anyone's game at
[SPEAKER_01]: any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any of these things could easily
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, heavenly days, they're Rosin
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they would have no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely be letting both of them
know, uh, to enter in the solvent list
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the judges will be so happy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like another little dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love another little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when Remo says, what time is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo with the classic point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of the nicest people ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always look forward to visiting him and
Sandra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly a saint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And involved for so long in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure, uh, if he can, he will be at the
karma cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I, I'm going to twist his arm
tomorrow actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as he's not like in Spain or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he'll come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love Remo and Sandy very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having them there would definitely make
me very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see who else we can rope in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, I've got a few contenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to compete against the great
gardener, you want to see how well you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do against Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your solvent list to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your rosin, your bubble hash and your dry
sifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always, uh, I know there's some
amazing, amazing quality in Ontario
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have friends that live there and
share little bits with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm definitely going to contact a
few people and say, you should try to
[SPEAKER_01]: enter this because it would be very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're judging, especially it's
going to be more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun to do a little judging,
especially when what you're judging is
[SPEAKER_01]: really worthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I'm doing, um, full lab testing
and paying the big bucks for the MB labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm sure that was another thing
that we hadn't quite covered yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The karma cup is going to be doing the
full lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbials and pesticides, not the
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's $300 a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, uh, totally, but I would
love to do that if I could, I really
[SPEAKER_00]: would.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This brings up another point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be nice to see the game
improved in lab testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like I, I, I went and surveyed
the entire landscape of who is out there
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not very many places and most
places take a long time and are fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think for the fact that
considering it was basically on the law on
[SPEAKER_01]: the books considered trafficking when you
brought your MMAR MMPR cannabis or hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts to the lab and gave it to them,
that was trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because of that, a lot of them
stayed out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think now that the government is
allowing for MMAR, MMPR, ACMPR patients
[SPEAKER_01]: to, um, legally have their materials
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they give it to the labs,
I guess basically the, I don't know if the
[SPEAKER_01]: labs are going to be having to acquire a
special license to be able to possess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to get a licensed dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that will change in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense that something along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really down with all the bullshit
regulations at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it seems to be somewhat needed as I've
seen in the non-regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, anything goes means if you
can trick someone into purchasing
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not as good as what you
said it was, a lot of that is happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: the dispensary and in the black market
industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's insane what the LPs
have to jump through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of that, you know, I'd like to
take the bullshit out that they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: having to jump through and just make it
real, like make, make the playing field
[SPEAKER_01]: level for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, listen, you have to jump
through the, I don't care how much it
[SPEAKER_01]: costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, we're doing pesticidal tests
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing microbial tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making sure at least for a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a recreational thing, well,
my God, they sell cigarettes as
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably you don't have to regulate it
too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably literally make the,
get cannabis radioactive and still sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: legally in a recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a patient market, it has to have a
little bit more of a higher driven ethics,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we have to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look forward to seeing you in October
for the Karma Cup.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you should have lots of fun people
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Patrick's going to come and blow
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also talked to, um, Crockett the
other day and he said he was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily to enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't know that that was a
possibility, but definitely just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: be out there and connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be great?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was speaking to him as well and both he
and his wife and they're lovely people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some dealings with them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that we're on the same level
and I don't see why it can't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you guys out there in bubble
man's world can get the word out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check them out at their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the Karma Cup.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's T H E K A R M A C U P.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much from there, they can get as
much information about this as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last dab got me stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to finish getting stupid right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like gobbly gook is coming out of my
mouth that I don't didn't quite mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you're getting me fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's, you're doing,
you're, you're the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly I won't be able to like
articulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more than you think.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks guys for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to see you at the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: October 22nd and 23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you Sarah Sunday for coming and
hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
