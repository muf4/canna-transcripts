[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live and direct, Hash Church 2.0
episode 18, episode 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the bubble man's birthday
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm not obsessed with celebrating my
own birthday, but I thought what a great
[SPEAKER_03]: way to get people to come into Hash Church
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I already got over a hundred watching
right now and I am about to, about to send
[SPEAKER_03]: out the links to the rest of the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just do that real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send that and send that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just make sure that we're,
everyone's hearing what needs to be heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I worry about whether or not the
microphone is working or something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got 176 people watching now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got Etienne in the room doing a
birthday bong for the Mr. Birthday boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't hear you buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me figure this out real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured something was kind of going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, play test sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't hear Etienne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can anyone else hear Etienne?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I checked my, let me know if you
guys heard Etienne speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Etienne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to figure this out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check, check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_03]: Technical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we figure this out Etienne?
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They heard you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can hear me as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try again Etienne.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear that?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys can both hear me and you can
hear Etienne, but I can't hear Etienne and
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to hear Etienne.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had him in hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice to see you brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I don't know what the problem is
because I can hear my test sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear default speakers built in HDMI.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if Mark can talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he can hear me headphones real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Debbie just showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to be able to hear you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This hurts my soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really hurts my soul that I can't hear
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can still say happy birthday to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we?
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a birthday joint, birthday bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthday joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass the birthday joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fixing up here because I can't hear
anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a pain in the buttocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on bubble man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Default speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Try default speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on there, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also not acknowledging anyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys talk, it's not grabbing your
camera either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's definitely something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll redo the whole thing if I have to,
but I'm going to try and figure it out
[SPEAKER_03]: first here to see if there's something I
can't do to figure out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone can still hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, I won't give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very nervous when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't hear anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Testing, testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has got to be annoying as hell for
you people watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys just keep talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just hope eventually to be hearing
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that works out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Aitian, what here Les Paul is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a Les Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an actual ukulele that looks like a
Les Paul, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a ukulele.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Electric ukulele.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way it could play in and be,
you know, raunchy and loud sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I jump off, it might close the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see who's going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it closes up, I'm going to restart it
and send the link out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't fret.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna find out for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you stepped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I do have is I also have the IACM
news, which came in the international
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis use is associated with lower
probability of obesity and healthy people
[SPEAKER_04]: that came out today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also the degradation of THC over the
course of four years under different
[SPEAKER_04]: storage conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Research has been done on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the US, Florida lifted a ban on smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis use in adolescents decreased in
Washington state after legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another study has come out to prove that
there is not increased youth use in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, even in medical states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks to be in legal states too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis use mitigates inflammation
associated with alcohol use.
[SPEAKER_04]: See more good news about cannabis and
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus is back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to welcome all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some news that's a little bit interesting
is there's a new paper came out showing
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit for cannabis for autism spectrum
disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some solid science there.
[SPEAKER_04]: International US.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was a US paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can try and find it to send it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's really good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: It confirms some of the things we've been
seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to welcome a few people to the
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously you're all welcome to
the room, but I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't hear Marcus though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear Marcus?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear brother Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to welcome both Debbie Goldsberry
and Callie Blackwell into the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to have some ladies in Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is my friend, Sheila.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sheila.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheila's good friends in the glassblower
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, she was at a party here in
Philadelphia yesterday, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marble Slinger's gallery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just going to say it was Slinger
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Marble Slinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus and I both know him well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sling and Marbles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sling and Marbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an installation of cranes
installed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time in Philadelphia and
Chester County in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know your area very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this out of the way first,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday to you, Marcus.
Happy birthday to you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bong Rips, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hip hip hooray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bong Rips, mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little birthday action today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It threw me off when I when nobody could
when I couldn't hear anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Etienne.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying out some new technology from
D-Nail, some alpha tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave me these new comets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got mine on the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new carb cap, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So trying that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to him the other day about
about that very thing and about what you
[SPEAKER_03]: thought of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's I love that we both get to be
ambassadors for D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: The R&D is fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: The comets are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that they're they're basically it's
a little sapphire or quartz ball that goes
[SPEAKER_04]: in, rolls around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the first gen of the D-Nail top.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the second generation of D-Nail
tops have that hole in the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so does this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new court.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's the Beagle made this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this actually has a hole in the top,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it causes a rotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are this is the alpha.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the beta run actually will have a
handle on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just got it the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So trying it out and giving feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I was stoked when I saw those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit for the first time a a what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was a red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say Ruby, but I don't know if it
was what is.
