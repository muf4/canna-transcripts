[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the Cannabis Journal
Club, Volume 2 with Dr. David Allen and
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a doozy today, so I'm going to
hand it over to Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Dr. David Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cannabis Journal Club,
and we'd like to thank God for this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for us to provide super
important information that could save
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives and your own family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, we're going to go
straight to our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're reviewing cannabis scientific
articles and US patents regarding cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the endocannabinoid signaling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our next subject is this super
important patent that we would like you to
[SPEAKER_00]: search out and print out yourself and read
it yourself and determine whether this
[SPEAKER_00]: could help you with your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not medical advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a doctor, but I'm not your doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're giving you information that your
doctor probably doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can take these patents and show
them to your doctor and he will be shocked
[SPEAKER_00]: and embarrassed that the medical school
rules didn't teach him about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're reviewing a US patent and
it's called Therapeutic Uses of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol Compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's US patent number 2010 slash
0158973A1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in June 24th, 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so that's 2010 slash 0158973A1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is this patent and there's the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can read that or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the patent number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shared it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of Dr. Allen's dictums is never
believe anything the government says.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even government patents are under
question, but they are the keeper of the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth because you can't lie and get a
patent number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want you to download these these
patents yourself and determine if this has
[SPEAKER_00]: any application in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the most important part about this
patent was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It proves that it decreases the size of a
heart attack by 66 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people can review this article and
they can claim or maybe it's not 66
[SPEAKER_00]: percent, maybe it's 60 percent or some
other number and then criticize how they
[SPEAKER_00]: did this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can't argue with is your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this patent, they have these
strange photographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me share it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got the no CBD treated with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is proof positive that cannabis
decreases the size of a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your eyes can tell you when you look
at this photograph, the white area is dead
[SPEAKER_00]: heart tissue that doesn't take up dye and
therefore it's white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the live heart muscle takes up the dye
and is covered is colored in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see the difference in these
two hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the top is one that's not
protected with CBD and the one on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom is one that's protected with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did was they took animals
and they gave them CBD and they ligated
[SPEAKER_00]: the front side artery of the heart,
the L.A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: left anterior descending artery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's a real super important
artery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they cut the blood supply to this
artery, it causes a heart attack and they
[SPEAKER_00]: sectioned the animals after the heart
attack and determined that if they had
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, it decreased the size of a heart
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was also verified by enzymes that
people that the animals that didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD had higher cardiac enzymes indicating
a more massive heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this patent proves several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It proves actually that it decreases
atherosclerotic plaque by about 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: and changes your blood lipid profile and
improves your blood lipid profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sure if you're a cannabis
activist, not one of your activist friends
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever told you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doctor ever told you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you have information that your
doctor does not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it and CBD decreases the incidence of
plaque formation by 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says here that CBD provides a
novel, safe and effective treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: various cardiovascular considerations with
fewer side effects than traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this works better than anything we have
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to treat heart attacks with with
steroids, but it was found that the
[SPEAKER_00]: steroids interfered with the healing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have abandoned using steroids for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a complete sin that there's not
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human trials in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 50 percent reduction inside of a
heart, 66 percent reduction the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: heart attack is the difference between
life and death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could learn from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And save people's lives in your own
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that we can get people to help
us spread this news.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this patent, it it mentions that CBD
might be incorporated in coronary stents
[SPEAKER_00]: to prevent instant restonosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or failure of the coronary stents with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now human studies have not been been
done on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't want somebody's heart to
be sectioned after a heart attack just to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more animal studies need to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clinical studies proving CBD's
efficacy in strokes and heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our last article that we reviewed was
cannabinoids as antioxidants and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that patent proves that it decreases
the size of a stroke by 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this patent proves it decreases the
size of a heart attack by 66 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a commonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD helps in both strokes and heart
attacks and probably a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are not even known yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want you to print this out and learn
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And teach your family members and your
doctors and anybody you know about this
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing evidence that cannabis cannabis
compounds does provide medical utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which means it should not be schedule
one which means no medical utility and not
[SPEAKER_00]: safe under doctor supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that photo should have ended the drug
war because it proves that at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: compound CBD and there's proof that CBD
and THC both provide this kind of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because of either one of
these compounds binding onto the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's due to other mechanisms other than
locking onto the CB1 receptor.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patent the patent suggests that CBD's
cardio protective effects may be mediated
[SPEAKER_01]: through several mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned its ability to treat
heart scars and part of the broader
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for treating various
cardiovascular conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also included the improvement of
blood lipid profiles can you mention a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more of some of the mechanisms
that CBD can offer cardio protective
[SPEAKER_01]: effects like its anti-inflammatory
interaction with adenosone etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well all of this is not delineated
perfectly because basically it's illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: to study anything about cannabis because
as a doctor you can't give cannabis to a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they don't allow any medical
studies because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need medical studies and maybe
one person that's watching this can show
[SPEAKER_00]: this photograph of the difference in heart
attacks to their doctor or to a
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature and prove that CBD is this is
not just a crazy story about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: working this is proof but government proof
that cannabis has medical utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want other people to learn about
this and other patents we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: review and we want God's help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want job over evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlike THC CBD does not bind
significantly to CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which avoids the psychotropic effects
while still providing therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see patients having an appreciation
for that especially with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of people who are
interested in using cannabis medicinally
[SPEAKER_01]: be terrified to use cannabis medicinally
from the decades of propaganda that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all part of kind of breaking
through that the patent proposes using CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: to prepare pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical
compositions for treating and preventing
[SPEAKER_01]: heart scars for improving blood plasma
lipid profiles for reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: atherosclerosis plaque load and enhancing
overall cardiac function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty incredible patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does all go down to that photo
that we showed earlier with the heart's
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue scarring with out CBD versus the
scarring with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be a doctor to look at
the picture and see that it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely mind-bending difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's profoundly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the difference between life and death
of your grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so profound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't really explain how profound it is
to be able to reduce a heart attack even
[SPEAKER_01]: by 50% 40% 30% let alone 60 plus percent
that's getting into a very high range
[SPEAKER_01]: almost 70% that they mentioned in this
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else, Dr. Allen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need help in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to spread this scientific
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help us in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to join our army and if
you have special skills that can help us
[SPEAKER_00]: with audio visual stuff, we would like
your input and maybe you can help us in
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading this super important
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't always an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a heart surgeon and I saved hundreds
of people's lives doing cardiac surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew about this these patents years
ago, but it couldn't speak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak about it to any colleagues because
it would affect my income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to I knew this information,
but couldn't even talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's part of the propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you and now I know when I look on
the Internet now for these same patents
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've had in my in my possession for
for 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're hard to find on the
Internet because the Internet is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep cannabis illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's groups of people that are
collecting scientific articles on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and patents and stuff and are actually
hiding it on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you've never heard of
this is proof positive that that the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war is affecting the knowledge of medical
utility because that goes against schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're trying to keep it
cannabis illegal for for the rest of their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an evil purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And jaw over evil, jaw over evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling Dr. Allen about jaw over
evil recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends from Jamaica, the gentleman
Joe, who passed away at a young age from a
[SPEAKER_01]: brain aneurysm, interestingly enough,
and all the younger artists, Kabaka
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyramid and and Kronix and this whole
group of of artists that were under Joe,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all sort of paid homage to him
through the J.O.E.
[SPEAKER_01]: jaw over evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whenever we say jaw over evil,
that is what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, Dr. Allen, we're happy to
continue to pump these episodes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for the people who have
supported with membership.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still allowing nonmembers to view,
but we really do appreciate the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have signed up so far for the membership
for the camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to keep trying to,
you know, pump out at least one or two of
[SPEAKER_01]: these a week for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep watching Bubble Man's World
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will be back very soon with another
episode of the Cannabis Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for your time, Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always educational and always
heartwarming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so appreciative to be on this and
allow me to to spread this critically
[SPEAKER_00]: important scientific education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see you hopefully within the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ciao for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jao.
