[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and Merry Christmas!
[SPEAKER_00]: It is December the 25th and I'm just
sitting here taking a break from my family
[SPEAKER_00]: activities and I thought I would come and
share with my audience a small gauntlet of
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the D-Nail with the Mothership,
Quartz, Pooking Bee, Colab going over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and then over here I've got the new
Quartz Banger that I got from Dark Crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass and I've really been liking it
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it in my Swiss Perk, which is always
nice to hit the Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I've got a dab of some Barb 99,
I've got a dab of some of D420K's Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Melt Dry Sift, and I've got a dab of some
Sweet Skunk Dry Sift Full Melt as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that I'm going to take a
CBD infusion of CBD with Turmeric,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been CO2 extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a friend of mine gave me this and he
wanted me to check that out, so I figured
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give it all a check out here on Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with, well let's start with
the Quartz Banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with the Quartz Banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've had a few people get a little
upset with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit I'm not torch savvy when it comes
to heating these bowls up and I really was
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting it too soon after heating it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that were just having
a hard time witnessing such a thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I believe that it was a hard thing to
witness, I'm going to let the Quartz cool
[SPEAKER_00]: down this time and I'm going to take that
nice tasty rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly enough, the few hits that I
took when it was really, really hot
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't as bad as you might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't that hot burnt sort of oily
taste that even sometimes bubble hash will
[SPEAKER_00]: do when you put it on a nail that's too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll hit the barb first and
foremost and we'll give it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys probably see I've got my Melt
shirts on representing the Tri-Comb Heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jibs and Ken, shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main boys out in Colorado, killing the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally killing the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to follow that up with a sweet
skunk chaser.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
we're going to hit a little D420K's Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Melt OG Kush Dry Sept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he gave me this almost a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably about a year ago that I
was at his place.
[SPEAKER_00]: In PG, I think it was just before
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me this little jar of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it's almost pretty much empty
in there, but there's a few little nerds
[SPEAKER_00]: of goodness left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure what better place to hit it
than on the Christmas Rips with Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are all having a great
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that means spending time with
family, friends and loved ones more so
[SPEAKER_00]: than acquiring gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired just a few gifts this year,
and that really wasn't my highlight at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: My highlight is and always will be the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this thing nice and orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see the ash from the last
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of residuals from the barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The barb was actually, I called it 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should call it 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his 24 hour run that I managed to
clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into 99% heads, but the quality of a 24
hour dry sifted tumble is obviously gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be much lower than say his five and 10
minute tumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even his one hour tumble that he does is
very high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Christmas Trinity with Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great holidays and a happy new
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see you on Hash Church in a
couple of days.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
