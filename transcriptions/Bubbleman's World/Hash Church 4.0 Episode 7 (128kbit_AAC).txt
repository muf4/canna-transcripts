[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunday morning at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are at Hashchurch 4.0,
episode seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna do a few things here real quick and
send out the links.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always important, always important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get the chatters in here,
take care of them first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will accept it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Johnny fucking B to the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think just like that, we are a go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back from Mexico, John.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing good, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here for an hour to say hello.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to go have breakfast with
Rob Clark because he's in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Clark's in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard I heard it was his birthday.
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy belated birthday to Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the face time with him a couple of
weeks ago, maybe two or three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he invited me down to kind of go down
to California and hang out and see
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also spoke with Ian Davidson the other
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you were there.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was out there with Mojave and talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob and Sam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully that was a nice time as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I was in a position to come down
and hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are missed, but I will convey your
love and appreciation as always.
[SPEAKER_12]: Grab the phone, go live and then go boom,
just to do a face time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happened the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hanging out with Amir and he just
called Rob up on FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was, it was nice to get that a
little bit of FaceTime with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will try to see what I can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no stress either way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes, you know, Rob is more on the
download.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the download.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't always need to be live,
but hey, hello everybody out there and
[SPEAKER_07]: internet land.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got about 67 people so far that have
popped in at 901.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Dirty Grows and William Wonder
and Tuget Sound and John Maddox,
[SPEAKER_07]: Tara Lee's in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got, oh geez, Bingo Lombardi,
Pambana River, BDNF Guy, Uncle Box and a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of Steve's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Potent Ponix is in Thailand right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve who recently sent me this beautiful
little hasher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hoodie and hats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashhead Outfitters over on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashhead Outfitters on, on dot com,
hashheadoutfitters.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to do 20 different things at a
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Dr. Mark in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Wade Lafter in the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful, beautiful Sunday morning,
familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Sunday afternoon for Dr. Mark,
morning for the rest of the West Coast
[SPEAKER_04]: boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't done a dab in 11 days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was waiting, you know, I might have to
go grab that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I could have two.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take two.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all good, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: So John, what, what is the first thing
you're going to smoke on in 11 days?
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you selected it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 10 on the counter.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was fooling around, but I think it's
some wedding cake, live rosin from Squish.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's what I actually, I,
I, I smelled those.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to wait for hashters.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no point.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thought about it this morning and I
was like, I really just want to do my
[SPEAKER_13]: first dab with you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny B just spent like a week and a half
with Tony Robbins in Mexico, doing the,
[SPEAKER_07]: doing the Tony Robbins thing and hanging
out with influential people and getting
[SPEAKER_07]: all inspired.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where Johnny B's been for the
last week and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: They weren't into dabbing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no dabbing, but I didn't meet a
lot of people on plant therapy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I met people who do a lot of ayahuasca and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You talked about how they're getting to
regenerative healing and natural health
[SPEAKER_13]: and dealing with different diseases.
[SPEAKER_13]: Energies when it comes to being able to
enlighten ourselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, it was very much a trip of
fulfillment and happiness education with
[SPEAKER_13]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the most great things and how
we kind of grow forward, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about growth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about understanding and how we
can kind of keep moving forward and what
[SPEAKER_13]: we do here as a team.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's how we as a camps community is we
join each other together in order to keep
[SPEAKER_13]: growing and look at our future.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at that next hundred years and what
we can do for the future.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, you know, plant medicine is the
key here, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're part of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're part of that, that push and keeping
it real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: The link's not working for Colin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes those links don't work,
but we send them another link and Colin
[SPEAKER_13]: jumps in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that true?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was having some trouble finding the link
for today's meeting until I realized that
[SPEAKER_09]: my email server stacks emails and I have
to thread through the old ones in order to
[SPEAKER_09]: find the one that's relevant to today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: You did send the right link.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just took me a few minutes to find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I never mind sending it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just re-sent it out to the whole group.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, welcome to Nick is in the house
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you feeling, Nick?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you were feeling a little under the
weather there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You feeling a little bit better today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually feeling okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a three weeks of hand
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple hundred acres was just wearing
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those 16 hour days harvesting hemp,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that for cannabinoid content or for all
of the above?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a bunch of new trials on different
processing methods and harvesting methods
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing methods to maximize aromatic
content as well as cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds awesome, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never met you before.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_13]: John?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you guys have never met each other
before?
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you just open up this awesomeness?
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, hey, let's try that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, John, what's your story with the
group?
[SPEAKER_13]: My story with my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: With everybody here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I don't know everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sort of new to this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a cannabis accelerator.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to help people with the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been involved with the industry for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I worked with Dr. Paul Hornby in the very
beginning and taught me how to actually
[SPEAKER_13]: decarboxy cannabis to bind receptors.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I always became a published study on
natural cannabis and pain control.
[SPEAKER_13]: And from there, I met all these lovely
people over time because of the passion
[SPEAKER_13]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we connected with Mark on a beautiful
plane ride one time come back in 2012.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just realized how much we love this
industry and helping others.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like everybody here, we all connected
from the heart with the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just been my life, my passion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael, I heard you talking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we are together.
[SPEAKER_13]: As a team, taking it to that next level to
help educate others.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate you, Nick.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's nice to finally meet you.
Likewise.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I have to go get my bond with a torch
and do a dab with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny's just lost like, I don't know,
like 90 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So John was a little bit heavier and he's
been, first of all, John didn't even get
[SPEAKER_07]: into the tip of his story.
[SPEAKER_07]: He fell like 30 feet off of a scissor
lift, like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And broke like most of the bones in his
body, smashed his head on the second floor
[SPEAKER_07]: coming down as he was spiraling off the
scissor lift and shattered his jaw and
[SPEAKER_07]: broke his neck and broke his back and
shattered his arm and shattered the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: side of his body and was completely
addicted to pills.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a zombie.
[SPEAKER_07]: He used to carry around this big cooler
and in it were all these pill bottles of
[SPEAKER_07]: oxycontin and all these other horrible
things that were that he was taking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was just a full zombie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he fought, he was one of these guys
that had like signs out in front of his
[SPEAKER_07]: house because he was like not suing
workers compensation, but they were just
[SPEAKER_07]: really trying to fuck them over huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's kind of, he had that whole thing
going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually he got onto cannabinoids
and essential amino acids and like linked
[SPEAKER_07]: up with Dr. Paul Hornby and got off all of
these drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, John is a super unique
character, but he is the most incredible,
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing guy in the sense that his drive
and his discipline is kind of second to
[SPEAKER_07]: none.
[SPEAKER_07]: When, when you really get to know him,
he's helped build this company,
[SPEAKER_07]: medtainer without even owning it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think most people thought he owned the
company, the way he put the energy into it
[SPEAKER_07]: and the way he sold that product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just an overall fucking awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a victim at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although he could be, he could easily be,
Oh, I'm a victim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Woe is me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's more like fuck this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to get better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then honestly, since he broke like
almost every bone in his body,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's probably been in another three or
four accidents.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was less than months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got T bones by a truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: He even has video footage of this truck
just going like a hundred kilometers an
[SPEAKER_07]: hour and smoking him and flipping him
upside down into a ditch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's, it's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't, you kind of can't even believe
what Johnny B's been through, but here he
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in our group and we love him.
[SPEAKER_13]: Life has been happening for me,
not to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the way you got to look at it.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: 20% of the problem, 80% of the solution.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how we move forward in life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we all have stories and we all go
through rough times.
[SPEAKER_13]: Weak people make weak times.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Weak times make weak people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Strong people make strong times.
[SPEAKER_13]: Strong people make great fucking times.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why we're all here and making
great times in life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause everybody here has a unique identity
of what they've done in life and where
[SPEAKER_13]: they're going, which makes it just so much
more rewarding of being able to connect
[SPEAKER_13]: with everybody to push them to that next
level.
[SPEAKER_13]: And here we help inspire people to do what
they need to do for themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why you guys are all amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I love you all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: To remember everybody falls, you know,
it's how you get up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm around everybody here is everybody
who stands straight back up again and
[SPEAKER_10]: keeps walking right back into that wall.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I love you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to welcome Julie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Julie's in the house from Canareps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Canareps is a really cool local company
that's, you know, kind of just teaching
[SPEAKER_07]: bud tenders and people alike about the
sommelier effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Julie, you're going to want to
hook up with, link up with Nick because
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick is really a sensory scientist and
what you're doing at Canareps and teaching
[SPEAKER_07]: people about the genetics and where they
come from and the volatile organic
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no one that I know that knows more
about that than Nick in regards to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We in the cannabis industry haven't even
been talking about for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been studying in the hops industry as
well as the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: and just has a really beautiful way of
putting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping Mark Lewis, Dr. Mark Lewis is
going to come in from Napro today as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: He posted a really cool article recently
on is the limonene in your cannabis the
[SPEAKER_07]: same as the limonene in your botanical
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an article that they posted on
LinkedIn under Napro, if anyone wants to
[SPEAKER_07]: go check that out, but it really got me
thinking like, oh, I want to get Nick and
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark in here as well as Dr. Mark and some
of the other characters that are around
[SPEAKER_07]: and kind of opened up this conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause to me, there's the least said about
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just love the idea of this sort of,
you know, on one side we call it the
[SPEAKER_07]: sommelier aspect, on the other side,
you know, Nick's more calling it the
[SPEAKER_07]: sensory science, which is really,
really what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So introduce both of you guys to one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited for this cause I've read
some of his articles and I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in discussing it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to note that
they're not different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different sides of the same coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sommelier aspect is more curating it to
what the individual is after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sensory science of it is analyzing
what's in there and analyzing people's
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to it and trying to understand
what drives the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, one is sort of experience
focused and customer facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is much more about
understanding the interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: people's sort of sensory or the
organoleptic properties or the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have and what they derive from the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, what this all stemmed
from, at least for me was a drive or
[SPEAKER_08]: quality because, you know, any seasoned
cannabis consumer is going to want to fine
[SPEAKER_08]: tune and explore all the different nuances
that cannabis can offer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got really frustrated during
legalization, seeing cannabis menus being
[SPEAKER_08]: displayed as THC percentage, Navy CBD
percentage, and then the brand and the
[SPEAKER_08]: cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just trained the industry to think,
Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: So potency equals value.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what people and people are
always driven by value.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as this training, this market
training happened, it drove the industry
[SPEAKER_08]: to really push for high potency product.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then, you know, you forget about the
flavor experience, which is the sensory
[SPEAKER_08]: experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, as I was really getting
deeper and deeper into this, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_08]: stimulate a discussion about what quality
is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really starts with input,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what Marcus and everyone here is
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the cultivar first, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: How did the breeder or the flower itself
get to a particular point where the flavor
[SPEAKER_08]: is so exceptional that and then it gets
cultivated and where the inputs in the
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation process that leads to better
quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that leads to a better sensory
experience, whether that is the smell,
[SPEAKER_08]: the taste, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then even the touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I love it when I roll up a joint
and it's so sticky that the joint just
[SPEAKER_08]: sticks to itself and it rolls to itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's an indication of quality to
me, but I wanted to open it up to this,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, group of experts here and talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That definition, because, you know,
I think if we can inspire and encourage
[SPEAKER_08]: the general market to say, hey,
you know what, it's not just driving for
[SPEAKER_08]: high potency products, but it's also,
you know, all the things that make this
[SPEAKER_08]: particular product, especially for
cannabis flower, so unique.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this all drives down to,
you know, what the trichome and what hash
[SPEAKER_08]: and all the derivatives that you can make
out of it, but it starts off with a plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I'm here today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about quality, that's,
I think it's a really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, sorry, I just opened the
YouTube link.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really interesting distinction
because one of the things that I worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot was sort of differentiating quality
from character, because quality is to me
[SPEAKER_00]: defined by, you know, terms like HACCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, hazard analysis and
critical control points where there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: danger to the consumer, that it's meeting
certain standards that have been set so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's like, you know, it is what it
says on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it does have the cannabinoid content
that it claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pesticides or any harmful
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a good shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no mold or mycotoxins or
aflatoxins, all those aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas character is much more of the sort
of descriptive aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like, yes, this meets our
quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good enough for consumers to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the right moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to rot or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about character,
that's more of a descriptive analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is in the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the experience the user might
derive from that so that we know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: components of it and what it smells like,
what it feels like, what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to consider
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are linked, but I think that
it's also important to differentiate them,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially as the industry matures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good quality for me is much more about,
you know, meeting certain standards that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've set as an industry, which is one of
the reasons that I do like the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation just for consumer protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you need to have people that
know what they're doing on those
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory bodies and are familiar with
the product rather than just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: abstract abstract individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it is very important to
distinguish sort of the descriptors of
[SPEAKER_00]: material from the from quality components,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to, you know,
sort of assess like assert my vision,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's an important discussion
to have.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's extremely important because
here we are in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're four years in with our head up our
ass because the Department of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: Control can't seem to understand that
cannabis is an unstable product.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they're not dealing with,
you know, air quality control inside of
[SPEAKER_10]: packages.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're dealing with oxygenation,
which, as we know, is causing anaerobic
[SPEAKER_10]: decarboxylation and all kinds of problems
that are inherent.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not keeping it refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's stable like they do with alcohol
and other products.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just they're inherent because the
majority of these people are policy monks
[SPEAKER_10]: and not actually users of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of the major reasons why
California cannabis is struggling right
[SPEAKER_10]: now is because they can get better,
fresher product from their local plug than
[SPEAKER_10]: this decaying, you know, anaerobic
decomposed cannabis that is oxidized red.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if it's three, as you know,
six or nine months old, it changes
[SPEAKER_10]: chemically because of the oxygenation
trapped inside.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they were actually using something
like combinations of nitrogen and CO2 and
[SPEAKER_10]: the flour into the concentrate to
stabilize it so that oxygenation doesn't
[SPEAKER_10]: continue to happen, I think California
consumers would find a more stable product
[SPEAKER_10]: available to them closer to the
representation on the vine than whatever
[SPEAKER_10]: the fuck they're getting in the end.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to say fuck pre-roll cones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, one thing I wanted to point out is I
think, you know, as we became,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, domestic producers and not
importers of the product, and this is the
[SPEAKER_14]: conversation I had last week with Rob
Clark and Mojave, we historically are
[SPEAKER_14]: still trained that, you know, these
feelings are the driving factor from this
[SPEAKER_14]: era that where we didn't really understand
what terpene profile was because we were
[SPEAKER_14]: importing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the time it got to us, we didn't
really know these flavors or never
[SPEAKER_14]: experienced them until we started
producing it here in the States.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got, like you pointed out,
at the end, fresh cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, we have these profiles that
we had never really seen before.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's really fascinating is as we go
forward into production, like Nick just
[SPEAKER_14]: beautifully pointed out, and others,
we don't really have a standard for what
[SPEAKER_14]: should happen during growth, in the middle
of growth, and when, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: post-harvest happens.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no, everyone has their own SOPs
and their own version of what should
[SPEAKER_14]: happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that, you know, creates a lot of holes
and it creates a little vernacular that we
[SPEAKER_14]: all can't stand on, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, you know, there's so many
things, like you said, there's no,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you just put it in whatever jar,
you know, there's headroom, there's that
[SPEAKER_14]: chemistry that's happening all the way up
until you finally stuff it in your bowl or
[SPEAKER_14]: vaporize it, whatever your use case is,
chemistry is happening, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's a lot of things that we have
yet to agree on that need to happen to
[SPEAKER_14]: make sure that that product or that that
particular varietal is represented from
[SPEAKER_14]: the moment that people like us see it,
which is super fresh and really volatile
[SPEAKER_14]: and lots of amazing flavors and tastes and
smells.
[SPEAKER_14]: But to your point, there's broken systems
that are jammed in between all this,
[SPEAKER_14]: all these things that we're talking about,
that make all of this stuff even more
[SPEAKER_14]: difficult because we have standards that
once it leaves the farm, what are their
[SPEAKER_14]: standards, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Until it gets to the, to the district,
you know, not even district to the retail
[SPEAKER_14]: shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there's just a lot to talk
about before we even get to, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: cultivation, because it's, there's
psychology, there's, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot of years of misinformation,
you know, and I think that's what,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, we're talking about here is
trying to demystify a lot of those things
[SPEAKER_14]: that we just, quite frankly, don't truly
understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I wanted to say is even taking a step
behind that, even before cultivation is
[SPEAKER_08]: really looking at all the work that the
breeders have done to create a variety
[SPEAKER_08]: that is stable, that is distinguishable,
because when we're looking at quality,
[SPEAKER_08]: we have to compare quality for within what
that variety is supposed to express,
[SPEAKER_08]: like not, you know, having a standard,
like, of course, cultivators are not going
[SPEAKER_08]: to have a standard way of growing all the
flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having a true understanding of
what a particular cultivar and its typical
[SPEAKER_08]: attributes should be and looking at,
okay, well, let's, let's compare it to
[SPEAKER_08]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, then the reason why this
triggered me was because I would,
[SPEAKER_08]: I smoked a GMO, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got no garlic, you know,
I got some mushroom and I didn't really
[SPEAKER_08]: get the onion, I got more dirt and
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking, okay, the breeder that
created GMO put the word garlic first.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm assuming, you know, the flavor
connection to garlic should really be
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm so glad there's, you know,
a lot of scientists here because I've also
[SPEAKER_08]: been in grow rooms where, yes,
particular aromas are so pronounced at the
[SPEAKER_08]: beginning in the grow stage, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But then by the time it gets packaged and
shipped out, I wonder, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: what volatiles have left.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to go beyond terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nick, I have a question for you about
esters and thials because the aroma of
[SPEAKER_08]: skunk and the aroma of cheese,
that's not a combination of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_08]: that is a combination of other chemical
compounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the cheese, garlic, onion are
typically thials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thials and thioates, as well as some of
the components that are associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel and gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some of the tridacanes and the
didacanes and some of those volatile sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of components that are more sort of
ethereal and more solventy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those in conjunction with those
thioates give the impression of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gassy notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting what you're
saying about variety because I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that, and this is going to be
a little bit of a long-winded thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think variety and the breeder's
intentions are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's two aspects to consider,
is that one, the breeder bred this in
[SPEAKER_00]: their particular microenvironment and
their particular growing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they arrived at this final chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it expressed in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has a tremendously strong G by E
sort of interaction in the genetics by
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, that depending on how it's
grown, where it's grown, how it's treated,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will express different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the whole aspect of harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned this earlier,
that these volatiles early in the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: period will smell like one thing and then
later on will smell like another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than that be sort of a limiting
factor, I think that's sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: expansive opportunity for growers to
express what they want to come out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than sort of limit ourselves to
like, these are the narrow boundaries that
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO must express, or these are the narrow
boundaries that grape might express or so
[SPEAKER_00]: on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose to harvest at different
times to get different expressions of that
[SPEAKER_00]: material, of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a beautiful thing
because I tend to favor rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy onion, garlic, gas, cheese,
I tend to favor the much fruitier,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter esters and some of the light
tropical fruit files early on and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes obviously as well, early on in
the process rather than the heavier later
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of as people have described it as
heady, but the very garlicky cheesy notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's important to give
growers especially, and then by through
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, consumers, the opportunity to
experience the plants at different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of ripeness because that expands the
ability to provide different experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you can go the opposite direction,
which is that you can say, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the micro environment that you want to
grow this variety in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to set that if you're
going to call it this, it must be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: within these parameters and it must be
harvested within this window to deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: this consistent experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one approach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other approach to it is to celebrate
the variety of the different experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: that one can derive from a kemovar in,
or I guess a strain within its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, from a sensory science
perspective, I love the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest multiple or the same plant at
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of blend to suit what I'm
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's another art that should
be brought into this is cannabis blending
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than single strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really fun opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one last thing, and this goes
back to what Colin was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the varieties will age
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we've seen very
much in the hop industry in that different
[SPEAKER_00]: balances of compounds will oxidize and age
and change at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a variety goes through storage or
curing, which we've seen for many
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, it's not well understood yet,
we'll see that certain varieties will
[SPEAKER_00]: stale very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will actually reach peak aromatic
intensity after weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some others will just fade off
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have seen the same thing with
cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess to what Colin was saying
earlier, working together to have industry
[SPEAKER_00]: best practices for storage, I think is a
good idea to prevent staling and to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent obviously any negative impacts for
the consumer such as mold development or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, and cannabinoid
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's a separate
conversation from looking at the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: intrinsic aspects of each individual
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those sulfur-containing compounds are
called thiols and sulfides.
[SPEAKER_06]: A sulfide is a thiol.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those compounds, while they're not
terpenes, because they're mostly like
[SPEAKER_06]: preenolated sulfides, they are derived
from isoprene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do fall into the bucket of
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those preenolated sulfides that Oswald
and others have now identified as sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: the skunky essence of cannabis are indeed
similar to those that are naturally found
[SPEAKER_06]: in things like onion and garlic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you know, Nick, is that those
sulfides, which are at the two oxidation
[SPEAKER_06]: state, sulfur can go up in oxidation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so sulfides tend to oxidize into
sulfates and bisulfates and things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those compounds have much lower
volatility than the parent sulfides from
[SPEAKER_06]: which they're derived.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the sulfides themselves are certainly
volatile, certainly have that skunky
[SPEAKER_06]: essence.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, as you mentioned, on oxidation,
on exposure to air and light and a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of moisture and probably a little bit
of acid from somewhere, catalyzes
[SPEAKER_06]: basically the oxidation of those volatile
sulfide into oxidized forms, which don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have the same nose profile as the parent
sulfides.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I wanted to say is that a
lot of esters, yes, have certainly like a
[SPEAKER_06]: really, really sweet essence.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take a putrid smelling acid like
butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that you've never had to smell
butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It literally smells like puke,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or decaying flesh, I think, or I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In small amounts, it smells like Parmesan
cheese.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's, again, where, and you know,
Nick, that our nose and our olfactory
[SPEAKER_06]: sense has developed this exquisite ability
to distinguish between cheese that doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: smell good and cheese that does smell
good, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just, you know, flowers from,
say, a pile of dog shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, certainly like, I think where
the human sense itself is, again,
[SPEAKER_06]: part of that, like what we were talking
about earlier, the cannabis experience
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you know, if you're just in the
dispensary purchase and the mindset of
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody who's in a dispensary,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: AT&T sees this every day, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's gonna maybe not be able to smell
the actual product they walk away with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the other data point they have
to look at?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, THC content.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you're already in that mindset that
I'm in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying top dollar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to get some kind of measure of
value for my purchase where when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to your guy who provides you with
legacy stuff, you open up that bag and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's that interaction that humans
have with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is that joyful discovery of,
oh man, I can't wait to put this in my
[SPEAKER_06]: bowl and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells so good, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that, you know, again,
for the lack of better, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: people have talked about this whole lab
shopping thing where people are trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: find labs that basically inflate their THC
results to basically create, this is all
[SPEAKER_06]: an artifact of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully as prohibition ends,
as we see this thing unfold, all that kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of shit will go away because I don't know,
the way I look at it again is that,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, it's a quality artisan product if
that's what you're after.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people just want palm oil from the
7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's not me and that's
probably not the people in this panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that human experience that you
miss out when you do just get palm oils
[SPEAKER_06]: down at the 7-Eleven is the opening of
that bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: And smelling of that, I'm sure ATN and ATN
buyers get to experience that,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a farmer shows up with a bunch
of weed or a crop and it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, they get to experience, this is what
our customers are going to enjoy because
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of substituting as a bud tender
or whatever, a buyer for dispensary,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that quality that we were
talking about earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: quality is a very subjective thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think certainly the terpene profile
is into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jar appeal, right, ATN is very,
very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to look good in the jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be someone, you know,
wants to see frosty trichomes and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you don't want to see larpy,
you know, sticks and stems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last thing I'll just say is this
whole thing around, you know, prohibition
[SPEAKER_06]: is again, because in certain markets,
prohibition sort of makes artisan and
[SPEAKER_06]: quality products out of financial reach
for say common individuals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're forced to go buy, you know,
products that maybe just aren't as high a
[SPEAKER_06]: quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's going to hopefully
go away when prohibition goes away,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is why things like the NO2 cans
haven't taken off for people because they
[SPEAKER_10]: still want to look at their pot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, those tuna cans, you can't see
inside them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas people still want to look in jars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even a couple of months ago, I even got a
set of jars.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course you have to pick them up and
you look in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I pick it up and look in the
bottom, what do I see?
[SPEAKER_10]: I see hermafridites with seeds inside of
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can still see what's inside of it,
as opposed to if it were in a tin,
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so quality control still rules the
roost.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with more educated consumers,
they want to see what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing I wanted to bring up that Nick
kind of mentioned was, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: you touched on was the ideology,
you know, of mixed phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think there's the idea that I
embarked on in a year long one of popping
[SPEAKER_14]: seeds versus monocropping the single clone
of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I found was the much larger
spread of terpenes and cannabinoids from
[SPEAKER_14]: those mixed phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I felt like that, you know,
I want to get back to that type of work
[SPEAKER_14]: because I just saw like CBC upwards to 5%,
THCV upwards to 10%.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then running the clone, not even
hitting for 1% of any of those compounds.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think, you know, just in terms of the
spirit of ideology and just theory,
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like there's more to learning
about, you know, the cannabinoid spread in
[SPEAKER_14]: a, you know, in a population that you
might not otherwise see in a single clone
[SPEAKER_14]: that's being passed around to everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that same clone grown in five
different environments to like Nick said,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's going to express five different
traits.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I just think you have a
better shot of a mixed phenohunt
[SPEAKER_14]: representing a bigger spread of the
population.
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's, you know, me throwing out
theories here.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's something to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's a lot to talk about it
seems, you know, we've gotten so far away
[SPEAKER_14]: from that ideology, it seems in farming.
[SPEAKER_14]: Has anyone tried that before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to mention about,
you know, throwing out the idea that a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone or cutting doesn't have all the same
anatomy as a seed plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can't tap in and capture all that
the earth has to offer that a clone would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to be, you know,
stifled right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing I wanted to
mention is, yeah, the consumers right now
[SPEAKER_01]: are shopping from a dashboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how challenging that is for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're trying to deliver a
poignant or pungent or potent purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're trying to give them that potent
experience more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that we have at the retail
partner we're working with is smell jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this last time I was tabling there,
I had our double OG chem that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for rebel grown, and some
gushments, very, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to like, go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if someone didn't like either one of
those, sure, then they could go get our
[SPEAKER_01]: Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you didn't, if you were a basic
consumer today or a savvy consumer today
[SPEAKER_01]: walking into a shop and you smelled either
one of those profiles, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: walk out with something and their mouth
waters, their eyebrows pop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't have that or you don't have
that when you are looking into a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always liked the idea of the tuna
can, like I'm a sporty guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like going to the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like backpacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, that's like my emergency
kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's crack that open.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's because I know what's in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, it's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember there was a company of four
years ago, three years ago, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do like a code that you could
scan that had a picture of every single
[SPEAKER_01]: packed container.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Cannabalus, I think it was
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty interesting,
but I just couldn't wrap my head around
[SPEAKER_01]: having to scan my herb before I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just seemed wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh, welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh and Josh.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's going on, family?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hey, Josh.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to see you too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Double Josh.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything's going good up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Snow's coming down the mountains.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got to get the potatoes and cabbages in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last minute ganja, stuff like.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to see everybody this morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to continue this conversation,
you know, I'm I'm trying to essentially
[SPEAKER_08]: map out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the the concept of you have a
certain genetic and it can be expressed in
[SPEAKER_08]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the inputs that go to that in
Somali terms is the terror.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's so much to it in terms of how
it is grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously a cultivar that is grown
indoor versus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might not have the ability to adapt to
that particular environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how, I guess, strong and
adaptable that particular plant is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when we're leading to helping at
the end of the day, at least my
[SPEAKER_08]: prerogative is to help consumers
understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I I train a lot of black tenders and
retailers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are selling blind right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's it sucks because the fun of
cannabis, you know, in terms of all of the
[SPEAKER_08]: sensory experiences is being muted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And closed off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And whether it is because due to the
processing delays in terms of packaging,
[SPEAKER_08]: shipping, distribution, sitting on
distribution shelves, going to retail and
[SPEAKER_08]: then, you know, and then now I'm smoking
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's six, nine months.
[SPEAKER_08]: Six months old.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why I want to talk about if
we could even break it down, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: if we have readers in the room,
let's talk about how do you get the plant
[SPEAKER_08]: or a particular genetic to express what
you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we're talking about science in terms
of Nick's perspective, there are the the
[SPEAKER_08]: quantifiable parameters that we can find
correlation to our experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: But our experience is also really biased.
[SPEAKER_08]: When terpenes were really coming out
strong, they're like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: like when I get something that's rich in
terpenaline, you know, like I get this
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and that is an experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would say there's so much more to
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, what is the impact of
esters and dials?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what are the other chemical
compounds that affect your high your
[SPEAKER_08]: experience?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are we not seeing?
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So many times when I dig deeper into
cannabis, THC and CBD sure are displayed
[SPEAKER_08]: because in Canada you're required to do
so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you look at the the analysis and
there's actually another three,
[SPEAKER_08]: five percent of other cannabinoids that
are not being listed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's the impact of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, having a little bit of a
different cannabinoid might have a high
[SPEAKER_08]: impact in your overall experience or the
overall exchange of of that in addition to
[SPEAKER_08]: all the other chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're talking with the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And never mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also believe that a particular product
may can lead to experience, but there's
[SPEAKER_08]: different metabolisms and different
tolerances in different amounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, at the end of the day,
we have to really look at, well,
[SPEAKER_08]: how much are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_08]: How often do you smoke and look at that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So before we even get to that,
before we get to the consumer guidance
[SPEAKER_08]: component, I want to say, how do we
empower the blood tenders out there to
[SPEAKER_08]: really describe in a very confident way
where we can say, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's take a look at the cannabinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take a look at what the lab analysis
can give us.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, the personal
experience is I is I know why you're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here because, you know,
this is a multi sensory experience when
[SPEAKER_08]: you consume it, when you are looking and
smelling at this, we're using all your
[SPEAKER_08]: senses and we're all built differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how can I find the power of language to
convert all of this science and,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, hard to pronounce words into
something that is, hey, if you really like
[SPEAKER_08]: this, this really minty chocolate flavor
profile, you know, I'm going to help you
[SPEAKER_08]: guide you this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, someone that has
that might not be that might not have a
[SPEAKER_08]: higher good tolerance or much experience
might need something that is lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see, so I think, you know,
and I also want to have an expectation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I meant the whole GMO,
you know, conversation or something skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I I smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in order to taste and smell like skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when that piece is broken,
that's where I lose trust and confidence.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why I say, you know,
if we have the perspective starting off
[SPEAKER_08]: with the variety, the breeders variety and
then how, you know, what are what should
[SPEAKER_08]: we expect?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the terror and then the all the entire
environmental inputs that go into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an argument right now which I
absolutely support and believe is you
[SPEAKER_08]: know, living soil produces amazing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's even more amazing is
outdoor natural grown cannabis from where
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis can grow very well in is the
best, you know, like just let it be in its
[SPEAKER_08]: place, in its nature, where it's supposed
to grow and let it thrive in its own
[SPEAKER_08]: environment there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've tasted cannabis, which is,
you know, bang on right blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it might not look nice because it's
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a complex thing about bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you're going to get that
variation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, harvest and curing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a huge argument about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why this is perfect because we
have experts from everybody in different
[SPEAKER_08]: stages of this production that talk that
can talk
[SPEAKER_05]: or do essentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we communicate all of these great
inputs to the consumer in a way that makes
[SPEAKER_08]: sense to them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because so many people are still hung up
on the Indica sativa spectrum,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's not about Indica sativa.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more so about the chemo type and the
flavor profile and what the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: plant, you know, the full expression in
terms of its lab analysis and its genetic
[SPEAKER_08]: background.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the lab component is a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what about all the work and the effort
that goes in to getting the plant to
[SPEAKER_08]: produce those kind of results?
[SPEAKER_08]: So to and of course, there's if we could,
you know, I'm really interested to know if
[SPEAKER_08]: we could just start from the beginning,
like seed to sale, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: eventually I do want to get to moisture
content and packaging and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how we and as a Somalia, you know,
we we try to convert what these inputs
[SPEAKER_08]: are.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, into descriptors, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Aromatic descriptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your nose knows that so many times you
might smell something.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, hmm, I just like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an emotional reaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not a I can determine the primary,
secondary and tertiary aromas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But eventually, as you train, we will get
you there so that you can have the power
[SPEAKER_08]: of language to communicate to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question is, like for all the
experts in here, what are the inputs that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're doing that really have increased
quality from your production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, onto that, Julie,
I want to tag on a quick one, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we really need to focus as well on
supply chain control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in beer, we talk about the cold
chain and we talk about sort of best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for storage and for packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shipping and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really, really important
thing to get to get at least to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of level playing field on which to
judge all these different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's so unfair.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe I'll just I'll just add
again, going back to this whole THC
[SPEAKER_06]: potency thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you when you buy cannabis or when
you it doesn't matter if you're getting it
[SPEAKER_06]: from a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three or you're buying it from your guy,
your legacy guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're there's a certain amount of
moisture content in that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the problem with the THC percentage is
that typically in herbs and this is not
[SPEAKER_06]: anything unique to cannabis in herbs
often.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oil content or or if they're measuring a
particular compound, that content is tied
[SPEAKER_06]: back to something called dry weight and
dried weight means absolutely bone dry,
[SPEAKER_06]: no water in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you think about it, if a bud
which has a certain amount of moisture and
[SPEAKER_06]: again, the other moisture consideration,
just talk to it for a second, is that
[SPEAKER_06]: above a certain moisture content,
it can still support microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after harvest, you know, the plant is
rendered defenseless.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have its own plant defense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly you can get mold growing if
it's not properly dried.
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly like I think in in bulk
biomass, when you're talking about hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're talking about buying stuff
super sacks at a time, understanding
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture content, it's more important to
understand something called water
[SPEAKER_06]: activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Water activity is the measurement that you
actually measure in the lab that then you
[SPEAKER_06]: can trace back to determine what the
moisture content is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And typically you want to try to keep
moisture content below the threshold at
[SPEAKER_06]: which mold growth would be supported.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but that aside, so if you think about
it, when you buy a nug or when you get a
[SPEAKER_06]: nug and there's a certain moisture
content, the THC content based on dried
[SPEAKER_06]: weight is sort of irrelevant because
you're not smoking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you send that sample to the
testing lab, the thing the testing lab has
[SPEAKER_06]: to do is they have to do that water
activity measurement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that water activity measurement tells
them what the dried weight of sample is as
[SPEAKER_06]: opposed to in its moist state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way they could really do that
in a high throughput way, again,
[SPEAKER_06]: just another handicap of prohibition,
is the labs are forced to do that in an
[SPEAKER_06]: oven.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you take that nug, that beautiful
nug that you smell, it just has moisture
[SPEAKER_06]: in it, it has terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put it in an oven to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just the water dries out, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else happens?
[SPEAKER_06]: Your terpenes start to evaporate and you
start to decarboxylate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a really nice presentation
given on online analytical seminar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to not get the woman's name
right, but she really hit this to the tee
[SPEAKER_06]: where that can swing the percentage of
measurable cannabinoids, just that effect
[SPEAKER_06]: alone, almost like 10, 15%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you have to ask yourself,
okay, if you're reporting THC back on a
[SPEAKER_06]: dried weight, what should it be in the
actual product that you're actually
[SPEAKER_06]: buying, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is wet, not decarboxylated and chuck
full of terpenes, the terpenes that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: attracted to, which is why you bought the
thing to begin with, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, again, where this whole lab
shopping comes up is that labs have to do
[SPEAKER_06]: is they have to measure the moisture
content because whatever is moisture in
[SPEAKER_06]: that flour can't be cannabinoids,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you think about all the weight of a
weight percent sample, everything that's
[SPEAKER_06]: in your denominator, there's a whole bunch
of water that's in your denominator that
[SPEAKER_06]: you take out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can do something called vacuum
desiccation at room temperature,
[SPEAKER_06]: where now you're not losing as much of the
terpenes, you're losing some of the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot longer to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because it takes a lot longer to do,
people want their results immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to submit something and they
don't want to wait like multiple weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these labs are backed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So think about it, they got to do this
moisture analysis to basically determine
[SPEAKER_06]: what part of the denominator is the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once they could correct for that,
now they can measure the sample by HPLC
[SPEAKER_05]: and correct for how much water was in the
original sample.
[SPEAKER_14]: 11%, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you elaborate on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it's very complex because
so the plant cells themselves hold on to
[SPEAKER_06]: water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Water activity is a measure of how much
freely exchangeable water there is between
[SPEAKER_06]: the biomass and its environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the real difficult thing like any
cellulosic material is also extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: hygroscopic, meaning that it actually
absorbs moisture from air.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually worked on a project where we
were looking at wood treatment chemistry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had to really understand the
moisture and the relative humidity and how
[SPEAKER_06]: that affects the properties of the wood,
because wood itself, here's a real
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sawdust sinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wood floats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know it floats, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But sawdust actually sinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So wood is mostly air, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the cells of air.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like most plant structures,
they're not just there for humans to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: on trees and saw them down and make houses
out of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there as actually a physical
respiration system for the trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there to draw moisture and
nutrients up from the root zone and the
[SPEAKER_06]: sugar that comes down from photosynthesis
in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at the end of the day,
there's a whole lot of reasons why wood
[SPEAKER_06]: and natural material is the way it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But going back to cannabis, it becomes
very, very difficult to say get to that
[SPEAKER_06]: bone dry, zero water state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what your question was
originally alluding to, Colin,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that when you do the water measurement
activity, the company that sells you the
[SPEAKER_06]: water meter also sells you a software
package that then extrapolates that water
[SPEAKER_06]: activity measurement up to something
called an isotherm.
[SPEAKER_06]: An isotherm is basically the measurement
of water activity per chemically measured
[SPEAKER_06]: water content by something called a Karl
Fischer titration, which is how you
[SPEAKER_06]: actually determine how much percent water
is in material.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very difficult to do a Karl
Fischer titration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have the isotherm curve,
which is determined by a Karl Fischer
[SPEAKER_06]: titration, you can determine what the
water content is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it used to be, Colin, I remember when
that number was 14%, then they moved it
[SPEAKER_06]: down to 11%.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, I think obviously the lower
when you're buying, say, bulk hemp,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're buying like 50 super sacks,
like, you know, 450 pounds apiece,
[SPEAKER_06]: you want to know that that stuff is dried
and it could sit in your warehouse as you
[SPEAKER_06]: process it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it is wet, you could certainly
get microbial contamination in those bags
[SPEAKER_06]: as they sit in your warehouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And even material that's, you know,
sitting and, you know, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_14]: bagging to trim, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that stuff's not dried properly,
to your point, you know, they could lose
[SPEAKER_14]: that material without them even knowing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, until you open the bag,
you're like, oh, my gosh, like,
[SPEAKER_14]: this is all Colin.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a very common problem early on
when we were buying kilos and looking
[SPEAKER_10]: through them is searching for those
because people would spike a bag by
[SPEAKER_10]: throwing in a fresh bud, etc.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, you had to hunt for
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But going back to Julie's point,
familiarity and education are the most
[SPEAKER_10]: important thing for our bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_10]: We train them for a week before they even
hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I own and operate Berkley Pastry.
[SPEAKER_10]: The more that the bud tender is educated
and can communicate that with confidence
[SPEAKER_10]: and that they have that confident
education, the better the consumer is to
[SPEAKER_10]: accept because the consumer is a lot
different than they were previous to 2018
[SPEAKER_10]: when it was strictly medicinal,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They had specific needs, whereas it's more
of a curiosity now with the adult use
[SPEAKER_10]: market.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've now over the past four years
become more accustomed to what those
[SPEAKER_10]: products and product lines out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But initially, they had to all show up to
see what they had heard about for the
[SPEAKER_10]: previous 18 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to them, it's just like, you know,
wow, it was really mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to then communicate that properly and
effectively and efficiently was a
[SPEAKER_10]: challenge when we're dealing with groups
of five to 10 to 15 sometimes because
[SPEAKER_10]: previously we were dealing with a patient
one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that communication and that style was
just as effective as that one-on-one as it
[SPEAKER_10]: was with those 15 because they were able
to communicate that information
[SPEAKER_10]: confidently because they knew it,
understood it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use things like having the Canna Bibles
and all the push-up tablets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Having them in the break room so that they
can flip through them and get a kind of an
[SPEAKER_10]: understanding about all these varietals.
[SPEAKER_10]: But on top of that, by having the
dispensary and seeing the amount of people
[SPEAKER_10]: that we are and that we do, we have a good
circulation of the genetics that are out
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So their familiarity becomes their
confidence to communicate that forward,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is completely one of the most
important things that Buntenders have to
[SPEAKER_10]: be is thoroughly educated to communicate
it, not just communicate it, but
[SPEAKER_10]: communicate it confidently that they
understand it, not weak and feeble.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I step out and say goodbye.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go meet Robin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Much love, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big love, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just so you guys don't know, I do 4,200
push-ups a month.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the 42,000 push-up challenge.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's 6, 8, 12, 2 and 4.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do 20 push-ups.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this has put me in this peak state.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been committed to myself,
to my growth, to the education,
[SPEAKER_13]: to moving forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why am I so happy?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I put myself in a peak state.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You inspire me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I don't even know if I could do
like five props.
[SPEAKER_13]: I started with two.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about commitment, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't tell me you can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you say you can't, you're lying to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I challenge all of you guys in your
life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Commit to yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: Commit to your dreams.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_13]: We grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love listening to you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, you do this for yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: You do it for your plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: You do it to learn.
[SPEAKER_13]: You do it with that growth.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to commit to that growth with
your plant, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Understand that commitment gives you that
growth, understanding the education.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you do it by committing to yourself,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So once again, every two hours,
put a timer on your phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: We all got these suckers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't give me any excuses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do two push-ups.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do four.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do a squat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do a sit-up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do that for 30 days.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got Mark doing push-ups.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got people around the world doing
push-ups.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a guy in a wheelchair with one leg
doing push-ups.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Toad.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's committed me to my garden.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's committed to learning and educating
and understanding water activity,
[SPEAKER_13]: how to grow, long-term cures, all this
great stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Understanding LEDs, the new growing
future, cannabis, cucumbers, peppers,
[SPEAKER_13]: and tomatoes, or what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really understanding these turbines.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really understanding the growth patterns
and how we can actually grow forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my warning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do some push-ups, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be doing our push-ups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a great conversation already
this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of wanted to go back to the
conversation about how a plant can express
[SPEAKER_09]: itself differently in different places and
helping consumers understand that
[SPEAKER_09]: difference that GMO can express.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's one of the keys to
Appalachians of Origin in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a program that the California
regulators are trying to roll out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big fan of because I do think that
there is a chance for small farmers to
[SPEAKER_09]: succeed in that framework, if you will,
to differentiate their product,
[SPEAKER_09]: be it GMO or whatever cultivar you might
be having to work with.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're at 600 feet in the Central
Valley of California, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_09]: a very different expression than you would
get at 3,000 feet in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really different versions of exactly the
same plants, exactly the same seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is really a key when you
start talking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, the conversation today has been a
lot about how to preserve the beauty of
[SPEAKER_09]: the product created for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that really one of the keys for
cannabis is to do with the specificity of
[SPEAKER_09]: how different practices, different
environment, different approach,
[SPEAKER_09]: different intention even can give
different expressions to this plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's really the key of capturing
the interest and imagination of the
[SPEAKER_09]: consumer, is helping them to understand
how differently this plant can express
[SPEAKER_09]: itself and how those effects happen in
your body.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other thing I wanted to mention in
the conversation about terpenes and
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenoids, one of the things that has
always been fascinating to me,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a very sensual person.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel things in my body.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I smell a flower that's of
interest to me, things happen in my body.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just feel it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know how to explain it more
specifically than that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Ganjier program I think is really
fascinating because you're trying to give
[SPEAKER_09]: words to those sensory experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a really beautiful process.
[SPEAKER_09]: I found when I was working more actively
than I am these days with plants,
[SPEAKER_09]: particularly with the patient needs,
one of the things that was always
[SPEAKER_09]: fascinating to me was when I had an
opportunity to take someone into a garden
[SPEAKER_09]: of cannabis plants and ask them which
plant was right for them, especially
[SPEAKER_09]: children were really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Picking out plants that I might have
picked without their input.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turned out that more than once,
those plants turned out to be the right
[SPEAKER_09]: one for that person.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think a key to the success of the
cannabis industry is helping the consumer
[SPEAKER_09]: to understand what's available.
[SPEAKER_09]: Particularly in hash church, one of the
things I love about this is we are each of
[SPEAKER_09]: us in our own way, incredible geeks about
this plant and about the things that can
[SPEAKER_09]: be made from it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people don't have the time or the
learning or the desire to really
[SPEAKER_09]: understand all of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What they want is the information that
helps them be consumers that can find the
[SPEAKER_09]: thing they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all know this plant can provide
that for those folks if we can help them
[SPEAKER_09]: understand how to find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, long winded rant.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Wade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, I'm smoking joints today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just a couple of minutes before I got
online.
[SPEAKER_09]: My clumsiness.
[SPEAKER_09]: I knocked my pipe off the table and
shattered my glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: But much love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say you're looking good,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm feeling your energy is high today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm really a couple of people have
mentioned it in the chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we like to see that and to feel that
I'm feeling really I'm feeling like my
[SPEAKER_09]: body is returning to some version of the
vitality I used to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will say I have really come to
appreciate the privilege, the form of
[SPEAKER_09]: privilege that good health is.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're enjoying good health,
celebrate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny B, that was a great call out on
taking responsibility for caring for your
[SPEAKER_09]: body, doing what's needed to make your
body as healthy as it can be.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's my fascination with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But cannabis is not the answer for
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, physical activity is huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Diet is huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mental attitude, willingness to be at
peace with your situation carries a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: weight in your well-being.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, quality of life is all it's
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wade, I just want to say how much we love
and respect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to think earlier this morning
about your leadership that you bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're such a your voice alone is so
stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so soothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grabs the attention of everyone in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that type of leadership, whether you
realize it or not, is unlike none that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're such a champion for the plant
and for the people that produce the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sure love and respect you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Craig.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sometimes hard for me to be
comfortable with that because,
[SPEAKER_09]: like in this room, I look around and I
feel such respect and awe at the people
[SPEAKER_09]: who are here to talk about their
experience in this work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what makes you such a respectable
elder and mentor for us to look up to and
[SPEAKER_11]: learn from the humble state that you live
in and that daily gratitude and just
[SPEAKER_11]: recognizing the beauty in everyone and
also probably the beauty in all the plants
[SPEAKER_11]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a beautiful teaching for us,
especially in this day and age and even in
[SPEAKER_11]: this industry when you get a lot of
different types of characters and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Wade and Monica and the
family that supports you at the house
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do love and appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for saying that, Craig.
[SPEAKER_01]: My chickens are captivated by his voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: My chickens all came in and literally
jumped up on the screen when they heard
[SPEAKER_01]: Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He even has power over chickens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Animals do tend to follow me around.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just build on what you said,
which I feel is just a part of the
[SPEAKER_11]: movement that we have all been a part of
all these years, which is knowing your
[SPEAKER_11]: farmer, knowing your origins, knowing your
food, knowing your medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why medicinal was powerful in the
beginning because you knew your farmer and
[SPEAKER_11]: maker and there was a level of trust there
and there was an understanding of what
[SPEAKER_11]: their garden did.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you understood what that GMO was
because you knew the farmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can have appellations of origin
and or war without knowing the farmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can play around with regions and say,
oh, this region produces something.
[SPEAKER_11]: But honestly, like a farm's different,
you know, down the same valley as another
[SPEAKER_11]: farm based off the practices that you put
into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, you're going to find
different expressions and different soils.
[SPEAKER_11]: So unfortunately, some laws that have been
created and recreational have taken away
[SPEAKER_11]: the ability to to tell the farmer to talk
about the farmer of origin, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially in Canada, when you're selling
20 kilos to Saskatchewan, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: you may or may not know your farmer in
that case.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you do, it might be a really large
and it may in that expansion lose those
[SPEAKER_11]: qualities of terroir and and and
Appalachia because of the environment that
[SPEAKER_11]: it's grown in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a small batch, knowing your farmer,
showing up to the dispensary, getting to
[SPEAKER_11]: know people and and human interaction
along with plant interaction probably is
[SPEAKER_11]: our best path towards health.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can use bulk medicine and oils here and
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can eat bulk foods and do all those
things, but it's not going to give us the
[SPEAKER_11]: same transformative health that we may
need in times of sickness or in times of
[SPEAKER_11]: health.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should be continuing our health path
even in our health.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, you don't have to be sick to
want to get better.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should just be better while being
better.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if you're a really humble,
regenerative farmer able to get exercise,
[SPEAKER_11]: like Johnny B says, you're able to
interact with labs and understand
[SPEAKER_11]: microbes, microbiology, microscope work
with teas and soils.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get to know the science side of
things, but you also get the spiritual
[SPEAKER_11]: touch where you get to actually live with
the crystals that surround you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when, you know, you're providing that
medicine to people, how are we going to
[SPEAKER_11]: make that an SOP?
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Kelly has sat with thousands of
women at birth, but she doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_11]: birth manual that says, you know,
this is exactly what makes this happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And another thing happens, you know,
she's using intuition and knowledge and,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, interaction and experience to
learn that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, knowing your farmer and
knowing your medicine maker, that's our
[SPEAKER_11]: best path towards health.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so when we can go down to the
dispensary or to a medical dinner or we
[SPEAKER_11]: have some special high-end ways of meeting
up with people, I think that's a really
[SPEAKER_11]: good way to really learn for bud tenders
to learn from people and from farmers to
[SPEAKER_11]: connect with consumers for consumers to
understand farms better.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, that's one thing to think about
when medicine is going out to the market.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to share like my experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a time when I was growing a lot
of vegetables for market, I would take to
[SPEAKER_15]: farmer's market and to chefs and to the
co-ops.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I, my experience working with the
co-ops, you know, not to knock a co-op,
[SPEAKER_15]: like we shop at co-ops and they can be a
really good option, but often they're
[SPEAKER_15]: doing things to make money and they have
to buy, you know, things at good deals.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like more often than not,
I feel that I get disappointed with what I
[SPEAKER_15]: see actually coming through the co-ops.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I see that they try to support a
lot of local farmers and they often have
[SPEAKER_15]: their pictures on the wall.
[SPEAKER_15]: But when I look at the tags, like,
you know, I live in Washington,
[SPEAKER_15]: it'll say California.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that, you know, especially the
lettuce, like where I live, you can grow
[SPEAKER_15]: lettuce year round, you know, with a
little bit of effort.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just like, it disappoints me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I just like, couldn't agree more
with what Josh is saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I really think that's what,
you know, has made Western culture,
[SPEAKER_15]: it made most cultures, let me retract,
that most cultures thrive is small farms
[SPEAKER_15]: and being connected to the food source and
to who is producing products.
[SPEAKER_15]: And anyways, just wanted to like agree on
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Josh.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, that opens up a huge
can of worms because I'm watching the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry in terms of how businesses run
these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very much about big, big companies
with financial backing and price skimming
[SPEAKER_08]: the market to undercut everybody else
that's really having the right intention
[SPEAKER_08]: in producing good quality small batch
products, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why the mass market right
now, the majority of Canada's sales is not
[SPEAKER_08]: this small batch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a single source farmer, like a,
sorry, like a farm to table kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more so about like, hey, let's hit
the mass market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to actually bring this
conversation back to all the inputs for
[SPEAKER_08]: quality and then looking at the,
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder where are they produced in the
country?
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis plant and what does that type
of volatility look like compared to
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know that there is a huge
following of cannabis consumers that love
[SPEAKER_08]: that gas, that funk, that skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, and how this all relates to
storage because when someone, let's say a
[SPEAKER_08]: purchaser at a cannabis dispensary is
creating a menu and they're trying to get
[SPEAKER_08]: a product and showcase a product that has
that gas, funk, skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, I also find that it does,
when you store it for a long time,
[SPEAKER_08]: the funkier it gets and it's really
pleasing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas products that are bright and sweet
and citrus and sugary, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this, I want, you know, whether it's
the storage or something that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_08]: last as long, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't cure as beautifully as compared
to like the skunky, gassy aromas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's my perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mark, I want to know more from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, there could really be some
basis in like terpene preservation in
[SPEAKER_06]: certain varieties that just, again,
are kind of like fleeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the analogy we've talked about
here on Hash Church before is that glade
[SPEAKER_06]: air freshener product, you know,
that you plug into the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just some heating element that
basically heats up a thin film that
[SPEAKER_06]: releases these floral scents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when you first plug it in,
it smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells just like the flowers on the
package.
[SPEAKER_06]: But about a day or so later, it smells,
it's got like kind of like a more of an
[SPEAKER_06]: antiseptic kind of clean hospital kind of
general smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a floral essence there,
but you've basically done fractionation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nick, you know this from the hop
industry is that the most volatile
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes, the way that fragrances are
looked at is in notes, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the way almost, it's kind of
analogous to music, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like certain notes are really loud and,
you know, people actually use loud to
[SPEAKER_06]: describe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember when it was first,
you know, when I first heard that,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, right, loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exactly, it's that punch that you
get, that terpene punch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, certainly, like you say,
Julie, these compounds are fleeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick could tell you this, that it's a real
challenge to basically capture the essence
[SPEAKER_06]: of the plant as incredibly cultivation
into a product, into the jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you could do that, you know,
that means you have a successful
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction method if you're going after
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because to me, it's like, we know these
things are cannabinoid producing machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no question that we could extract
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real question and what differentiates
the different varieties and what a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: growers put a lot of investment into,
right, is the different varieties and the
[SPEAKER_06]: different flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maintaining those flavors through a
processed product is really quite a
[SPEAKER_06]: challenge because you have to treat these
compounds with kid gloves, right,
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a little bit of oxidation goes a
long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last thing I'll remind myself is
that when they package potato chips,
[SPEAKER_06]: they inflate those bags with nitrogen to
make sure there's a pillow of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_06]: over the top of those plant oils,
which if it sits on the shelf for too
[SPEAKER_06]: long, will start to go rancid if there's
air in there, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's nitrogen in there,
nitrogen kind of keeps in the inert
[SPEAKER_06]: atmosphere, which also, I think,
Nick, just the idea of like pushing by,
[SPEAKER_06]: like people have always talked about like
vacuum sealing their herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly for certain applications,
that's a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vacuum sealing, you know, you pull all the
air out, but there's certain machines that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually pull the air out, but then
reintroduce nitrogen to give you almost
[SPEAKER_06]: like a pillow of weed as opposed to this
shrink rat, you know, quarter pound that
[SPEAKER_06]: used to be this big is now this small.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, again, the chemistry that goes
on to preserve those flavors is just part
[SPEAKER_06]: of like the natural curing process that
happens in cheese and pickles and yogurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really, this is like food gone
bad, but, you know, food gone bad in a
[SPEAKER_06]: good way because of the way that the
microbes are transforming that yogurt or
[SPEAKER_06]: the way that, again, like when you put
pickling spice and you have a certain kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of chemistry that's going on and curing of
those pickles, there's things that are
[SPEAKER_06]: happening there that, again, is uniquely
human, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pickles are a uniquely human thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like ayahuasca, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we were there to basically put
together these different components in a
[SPEAKER_06]: way that, you know, humans had to be here
to do that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is humans from the jungle?
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Nick.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you've said similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dip into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of things that Mark
brought up that I think are in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: what Julie was asking that I think are
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your glade analogy is a great one,
but to make it more perhaps to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't buy anything larger than a half
gram vape anymore because as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: heating it up and as you're consuming it,
you're driving off those top notes and it
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and you'll see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the darkening and that's from
the heat reactions, but you'll drive off
[SPEAKER_00]: the lighter notes first and your first rip
is going to be very, very different from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one that's halfway down the
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larger volumes is not actually the
better way to store things, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to what Mark was saying, you know,
there's a couple of different things going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different things going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to kind of try to riff on
them as I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously light, heat and oxygen are the
enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a point, you know, if you want to
preserve it from the very, very first
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, you want to preserve all those
notes, you know, I think what Marcus has
[SPEAKER_00]: done with bubble hash and, you know,
full melt and all that stuff and that
[SPEAKER_00]: separation, that concentration under,
you know, low oxygen environment and under
[SPEAKER_00]: inert gas or something like that is the
best way to preserve it because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the vast majority of the
compounds that we're interested in are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to preserve those and
concentrate those is really the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve those aromatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I typically move to
concentrates for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just because I enjoy it more and it's
also easier in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, there is a role for oxidation
and that's that you see that in the curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process that some of those compounds you
actually want to oxidize to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: higher notes or those heavier notes that
you're after, like some of the onion and
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic, those are predominantly,
you know, oxidized dials and so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've become these very, very,
you know, chunky aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, as you are smelling things and
as the plant matures and as you go through
[SPEAKER_00]: your consumption, you will be selectively
experiencing different compounds at
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, if you leave a variety,
you know, past its prime, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties will eventually tend towards
heavier, skunky, garlicky, oniony aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cease producing a lot of the fresher
compounds and a lot of those compounds are
[SPEAKER_00]: much more aromatically powerful than the
lighter top notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top notes are still there,
but you just can't differentiate them
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you fractionate them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fun project I'm working on as
well is trying to really see how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, you know, blend to create these
experiences using, you know, multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: feedstocks and stuff and then also
fractionate those feedstocks apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: create entirely novel experiences from
different plants that would never,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would never get that in one
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a lot of fun there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, I just wanted to say, you just
reminded me of something that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: mention that I forgot, which is that
dimethyl sulfide is kind of like the
[SPEAKER_06]: essence of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's got that kind of like almost
rotten egg smell, but more organic and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's kind of like canned corn,
tomatoes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you take that up one oxidation
state to dimethyl sulfoxide, now you got
[SPEAKER_06]: something that's got a real kind of like
garlic, almost overpowering kind of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, the smell of DMS.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very, very different than DMS,
but that tells you that again,
[SPEAKER_06]: there could be like trace amounts of
oxidation that happens to those dioles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes them up to the sulfoxides or
higher oxidation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's on its way up to being a
sulfate, which is a fully oxidized.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, again, I'm just throwing it
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe again, in the curing of those skunky
varieties to get the maybe less harsh
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk, but more of like a nutty kind of
garlicky thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of goes through somewhat of an
oxidation, but it's all speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think actually that's a,
that is one of the key drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the quote unquote cure process,
because, you know, there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different mechanisms and proposed,
but if you see people curing doing a hot
[SPEAKER_00]: cure, a cold cure of their, their
residents, their live residents or their
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, you know, you're not going
to be having a lot of that, that microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be having a lot of
sort of plant sort of metabolite or
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is just basically chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you, and the primary mechanism
I'm suspecting is oxidation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: A sulfide, if we just have a beaker of
sulfide sitting here, as we speak,
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll start turning into, to it'll,
it'll just air oxidize.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's auto auto catalytic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, that's light and air.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's enough oxygen and air to basically
promote that reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even under inert gas, you're never
going to get all the oxygen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to, there's, there's going to
be some remaining in just in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: in between the combat or in between the,
the, the heads or in the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even just, you also get cascade
reactions where oxygen and hydrogen and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, water are going to be
liberated throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those reactions can also provide more
of the, of sort of the base, some might
[SPEAKER_00]: say staling or at least or elements that
can convert compounds into other and other
[SPEAKER_00]: forms and oxidize them or have them go up
and down states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And am I correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the skunky thing that happens with
beer, it's a completely different set of
[SPEAKER_06]: chemistry, but still oxygen and oxidation
is sort of rearing its ugly head there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, there's a couple of different
processes there, but in beer, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: typically actually, it's called light
struck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a light reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a photon that knocks off a,
I forget exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a complicated reaction,
but it's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with, I think it's a three
methyl two butene thiol, which is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that very skunky character.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is also because of those
aromatics, some of the shared aromatics
[SPEAKER_00]: are, are also, is also very sensitive to,
to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, so light and heat are the two
main drivers, but light and heat in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of oxygen, it's going to go fast,
like, like seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, if you ever want to try it,
get a, an IPA or beer, if you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you, if you consume, take it out into
the sunlight and then like literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the reaction happens almost at the
speed of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just put it out in the sun and
pull it back and it will change
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll skunk real fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nick, isn't it safe to say,
I mean, to sort of address Julie's issue
[SPEAKER_06]: around quality and, and, and freshness is
that, is that it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, I don't know if you could,
if you could have kind of like an
[SPEAKER_06]: expiration date that makes sense,
because in most cases, most expiration
[SPEAKER_06]: dates on products that are in
dispensaries, they just, oh, six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It expires right at that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's something, a magic that happens
that particular day that makes it now
[SPEAKER_06]: expired.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to put some type of like, like,
I don't know if you know these little
[SPEAKER_06]: Boveda packs that basically act as kind of
like the way a humidor would, would act in
[SPEAKER_06]: analogous ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, and I mean, I think once we,
once we have a good amount of,
of freshness that we can have,
we can have a lot of, of freshness.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's the best way to tackle
that.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you think that there's something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually, I forget where I talked to
those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was on future cannabis project
and they want to set up a call with me
[SPEAKER_06]: because I think there's an interesting
aspect again around conditioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: the environment in which the cannabis is
packaged.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really important because I think,
again, like if you're gonna mass produce
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're just gonna put a bunch of stuff
in a warehouse and it's just gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: inventory like, you know, many weeks
before it gets, I mean, that's not the way
[SPEAKER_06]: cheese works, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly, I mean, again, I don't see
where, you know, things always come
[SPEAKER_06]: unraveled is that states have different
rules around compliance and packaging and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cannabis companies are trying to
make efforts to, you know, reduce
[SPEAKER_06]: packaging, you know, footprint,
you know, and less plastics and trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: go to more natural packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ultimately, there is no thing because
it's a fresh product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be grown fresh, needs to be
taken to the place of commerce and bought
[SPEAKER_06]: and consumed while it's still fresh,
just like the produce that we buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not something that you could just
put in a warehouse for several months and
[SPEAKER_06]: just pull down whenever it's convenient.
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing I think that struggle I've been
through is, you know, the thing you're
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of striking a chord with me is like,
no one, we didn't really talk about
[SPEAKER_14]: headroom and how much air gets blocked in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like these are all things we learned
that we're like, oh my God, over time,
[SPEAKER_14]: my cannabis in a room, in a jar with lots
of headroom goes bad faster.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, this is all, you know,
no one, was there to tell us that this is
[SPEAKER_14]: happening.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I'm still learning and going
into Sam was right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus was there and Sam was there to tell
us all about it, but none of us were
[SPEAKER_06]: listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a whole bunch of people listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess what I'm trying to get across is
like, you know, I had to learn through
[SPEAKER_14]: trial and error, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you're highlighting is still
things that today, predominantly producers
[SPEAKER_14]: are not thinking about product,
but the packaging companies are and
[SPEAKER_14]: they're trying to sell it on producers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that ideology is a little
backwards where we're really the ones that
[SPEAKER_14]: are supposed to be saying to these people
that are providing these solutions to us
[SPEAKER_14]: that, Hey, we need less headroom.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need better seals.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need better shelf life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And to start that narrative and that
conversation with them so they can provide
[SPEAKER_14]: the solutions for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I think that's the biggest hurdle
today that I find is jars are great,
[SPEAKER_14]: but this has too much headroom too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the issue with cannabis storage
is, is even that seatbelt when we started
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the nitrogen infusion packaging for
farmers to save their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with that is as soon as you
take the cannabis out of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: it degrades twice as fast starts to break
down immediately quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we need to look at is that,
and, and understand that there's a lot of
things that we need to look at and
understand that there's a lot of things
that we need to look at and understand
that there's a lot of things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to look at and understand that
there's a lot of things that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at and understand that there's a lot
of things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we need to look at and understand
that there's a lot of things that we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I think that what you're
talking about, Colin, I'm so stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw the other day, these new pop
top caps that go on the concentrate and
[SPEAKER_02]: they snap the top and it sucks all the air
out of it and it seals it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when you open it there,
the answer is no air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is to remove oxygen and not to
add nitrogen, you know, and, and it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a perishable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the other thing too is the
small farmer and the fact that the small
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer's product, if, if a small farmer's
product is being pushed out, in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion, typically there's not the,
it doesn't have the correct marketing and
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't have the correct push behind it
because we all know that's typically a
[SPEAKER_02]: better product, but if it's not marketed
correctly and it's not produced,
[SPEAKER_02]: a big company reached out to me,
they're doing this big, a big panel and
[SPEAKER_02]: this new hash thing they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had all these, all these
different panels about all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing about branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what a mistake,
you know, like we brand and market in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: By looking over at the other guy and
going, Oh, Myron jars got that big label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna put a big label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and fucking fruit colors and sticker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, that's not marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the guy that comes out
[SPEAKER_05]: on it's like, but it's, it's really the,
the, I think to answer the question when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes down to cannabis itself,
it all needs to be turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be enjoyed as flower for a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that's for like the, for the right
now, you can't store cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen anybody successfully pull
it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen it be like me not have to
be honest to them to be like, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not as fresh as it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as good as it was that we all
know that everything has a point of
[SPEAKER_02]: perfection in this, in the curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a period in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a moment in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you got to keep doing what you do
and you got to keep networking and build a
[SPEAKER_02]: great community to, to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That feeling all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the community parts, a huge part,
you know, when it comes to packaging,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're here, like I I'm starting to see new
packaging stuff, you know, alchemy jars,
[SPEAKER_02]: different shit that just gets an
understanding of what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my alchemy jars, I've tested them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done like, I put like four grams in
an alchemy jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put 12 grams in an alchemy jar or put
22 grams in an alchemy jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I let those sit and I,
and I hit out of them and I open and close
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, and the space, the per,
you know, how it preserves that product is
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just does such a great job.
[SPEAKER_15]: This thing was full when I, when I saw you
last, dude, this thing was full and you
[SPEAKER_15]: could see it's still beautiful in the very
bottom of that smoke, the whole jar
[SPEAKER_15]: myself, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to, I wanted to bring this up in
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a good, a good time,
but like the last few weeks, my head was,
[SPEAKER_15]: was kind of going back in time to when we
first started making rosin and I was
[SPEAKER_15]: selling full melt hash in the medical
market up here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were, it was also the time when we
were transitioning to fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there was a period where I would
have a lot of dried material and we would,
[SPEAKER_15]: we would wash it with water and we'd sell
part of it as hash, as full melt hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'd squish it, the other stuff
that wouldn't melt and put it out as
[SPEAKER_15]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the rosin was a by-product there
for a while.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just kind of thinking back
through the cultivars I was using.
[SPEAKER_15]: And remembering that the ATF in particular
was a good, a good in the cherry pie was a
[SPEAKER_15]: good thing that stuck out of my mind when
we dried the flower and even almost over
[SPEAKER_15]: dried it, did a long, a long dry on it and
then washed it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to pull out better yields and
a better quality product with certain
[SPEAKER_15]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_15]: For the last however many years,
everyone's been really focused on fresh
[SPEAKER_15]: frozen and it's done an amazing thing in
it, but we've kind of gone to this
[SPEAKER_15]: categorization.
[SPEAKER_15]: We said certain things wash or don't wash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not really what we should be
like in, in Kai is kind of hitting this.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's starting to come up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I actually went back.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was like episode 65 or
something in hash church.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to go back quite a ways and listen
through a number of hash churches,
[SPEAKER_15]: old ones about around that time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I remembered what I was doing and
what I was putting out and I could look
[SPEAKER_15]: back in my Instagram and get a timestamp
and Sam and a fucking Cuban talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: dry sift about taking it for a full 90 day
dry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And all this just clicked into my head.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, dude, we need to start
fucking around with like dialing in which
[SPEAKER_15]: variety we, we fresh freeze, which variety
we dry then wash or, or dry sift,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and so kind of part of the answer to,
to your question, Julie is we're still
[SPEAKER_15]: fucking riding trick, uh, riding trends a
bit ourselves.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're still a little bit confused
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting so much better.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then more online and the more
community and the more events it's like,
[SPEAKER_15]: we're learning rapid rapidly, but,
uh, there's still a lot to, to,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we could go back, like,
you know, Sam knew it all along.
[SPEAKER_15]: Could, could we ever really, you know,
that should be the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam always say, I'm always set.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash makers are the archeologists of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: They are.
[SPEAKER_15]: They are.
[SPEAKER_15]: I do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm watching.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the one more thing I was going to say,
I was watching these guys in Balochistan
[SPEAKER_15]: in Afghanistan, cut the whole plant
hanging up just inside a clay building.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the whole thing dry through the
winter, similar to tobacco where it has a
[SPEAKER_15]: bit of fluctuation, but it's staying
within a bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they shake off the dry heads and
they're, they're in, and they're,
[SPEAKER_15]: they're, you know, when I, the pictures I
see their hash game is better than ours.
[SPEAKER_15]: When it comes to doing dry, dry,
dry resin, you know, anyways, I'll,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll shut up and let you go out of sin,
but well, they're all different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think what people should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I owned a type six here in California,
I already thought of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take a strain in, I would run it
every fucking way you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd run it BHL.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solvent list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd run it for a type seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd run it every single way I'd dry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd run it into, you know, use the Spanish
methods of like drying and pressing and
[SPEAKER_02]: the old, old techniques and do all that
stuff and then have it all out in front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go, okay, well, this one's
going to be great in the proxy without
[SPEAKER_02]: water as a dry press.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This strain expresses itself most,
you know, the best as a dried finished
[SPEAKER_02]: product, it seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it'd be great to have all of
those different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out there and then have a cup where people
get to come and try those things and give
[SPEAKER_02]: their opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I pat Dougie on the back for
constantly being active in our community
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing all this stuff as a marketer,
you know, Dougie from hitman, but him to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out and be like, Oh, a blind test,
you know, have an event that's a blind
[SPEAKER_02]: test where people come to it and you,
you, the consumer sits down with a
[SPEAKER_02]: blindfold on and you're then being
challenged to tell whether it was organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor, outdoor, BHO solvent list.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what the fuck are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just took all the fun out of what we
do for what reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: For ego so that you can go, ha ha.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, that's not what this community
is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what fucking all these things
are about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not what the fucking
plants about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it should be like, did you get
high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: High five.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what it should be because that
leads to hugs and happiness and loving
[SPEAKER_02]: kindness and community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not this division of like,
Oh, he's got pie on his face because he
[SPEAKER_02]: there's Marcus, the king of fucking
solving this hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he thought a BHL was an indoor stall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, get the fuck out of here,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, what do you win?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humiliation is your prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, that's division.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, our entire industry
community, I love the hash component of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of been pulled towards this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like, like a massive planet
because it is, I feel like best heads and
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that are really like,
and then not to say that the other people
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, we're not about marketing
anything, but the product and letting the
[SPEAKER_02]: product speak for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and if the products in a mile are
fucking bad with the hash industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to allow it to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we'd say that's trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, we don't want that as part of
what we're going to support.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower industry can, because it's real
estate to be marketed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that mylar bag that can be marketed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you say, you know, Colin,
it fucks up the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much headspace is too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they need to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like to that, to that head space aspect
and to purging and to the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pillow packs like they do for,
for chips and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting side note, my uncle actually
is the patent holder for, for that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually invented that way back in the
day for, for veg and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, what's interesting for,
for, to consider this is that you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually store, you know,
you can actually store it in your shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually store it in your shelf
life.
You
[SPEAKER_05]: can actually store it in your shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point where you can, you could
probably pick it up in five years and not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a precipitous loss of, of character.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will change a bit, but it won't be,
it won't be terrible, terrible,
terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one of the ways that you
quickly will it degrade afterwards?
[SPEAKER_00]: The degradation is, it's, it's about the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see, you don't see a lot of,
of acceleration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just that the perception of
degradation is much higher because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: opened it, it smells fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you've introduced
oxygen and it starts to go because the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidation reactions are very, very quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what I, you know, in an ideal
world, consumers would have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: open select, ideally it would be a single
serving thing, but that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly wasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that wouldn't, that wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things you can do is you
can, you can take your, your, your serving
[SPEAKER_00]: size or whatever you're going to consume
out of the package and then you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum it out and then reflush it and then
put it back in the freezer and that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll, that'll help it, help it stay
for, for, help it stay fresh for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the headspace discussion though,
even in an inert environment, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal gas law being in effect,
which is that basically once you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity for volatilization, you will get
volatilization into the headspace to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it is equal between the source material
and the volume in the headspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, assuming you have, you know,
X grams or X micrograms of, of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your volatiles, if you have 50% headspace,
you're going to have 50% of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: of those volatiles end up in the headspace
and 50% still stay in the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think headspace reduction is a,
is a huge, a huge thing that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, vacuum packing isn't always the
best way to do it either because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: crushing the material and you're also,
you know, you lose some of that character.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I hate to always bring up the
hop industry, but we've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that actually pillow packs were
more effective at preserving the material
[SPEAKER_00]: for longer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons was also that in vacuum
packing, you create a fragility in the
[SPEAKER_00]: package because the plant material is
sticking against the sides and it creates
[SPEAKER_00]: little hard nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those, you know, they're moving
around a box, you'll shear off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that mylar, some of the, some of the metal
foil that's in between,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can vacuum pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, one of the things that you run into
is also that you have sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use hops again, you have
what's called a storage index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is primarily determined by the
degradation of alpha acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be equivalents like cannabinoids
that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the volatile mix and
other compounds that are present,
[SPEAKER_00]: that storage index will go up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a lot of compounds that
are, have the potential to have highly
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive degradation products,
that is going to lead to a reduced storage
[SPEAKER_00]: index because those are providing the
building blocks for the reactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: will degrade or at the very least change
the material that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a lot to be learned
from the other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said earlier, people,
this is the same for cheese, same for
[SPEAKER_00]: salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same for hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same for any agricultural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to try to preserve it as long as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to preserve that
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes in back to the sort of the rant
I had earlier about quality versus
[SPEAKER_00]: character, if you have all the quality
metrics in place where it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have any aflatoxins, there's no microbial
contamination, and it's in as secure
[SPEAKER_00]: environment as possible, then it's just
it's still going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's still safe to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to be as, it's not
going to be the same level that it went
[SPEAKER_00]: into the packages.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's, you know, this is all a matter
of rate right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a matter of rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want great products like cannabis,
grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want the best of the best,
then grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a consistent product,
you need a mass producer to consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: produce it so that you can enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is, is we don't
live in a world anymore where you can't go
[SPEAKER_02]: out and get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can continuously get the same thing
over and over again now because the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary is there or the black market's
there in a stronger way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like back in the day when
you'd find something, you had to buy as
[SPEAKER_02]: much of it as you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you had to figure out how to
fucking store it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you break it out on Marcus's
birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you don't have to do
that anymore because we do have large mass
[SPEAKER_02]: producers that can produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my brain started wandering back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we were talking about large
producer to small producer and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing out the small producer and it's
just going to be big producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens in every industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how do they even out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the small producer like the artist
will go with the larger distributor and
[SPEAKER_02]: get that product out on a mass scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in every industry and everyone's
still protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think if everybody just like,
you know, lived a healthier life,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wouldn't worry so much in their head
about all these other things that could be
[SPEAKER_02]: more easily solved through a healthier
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were so many points I wanted to
chime in here because I have so many
[SPEAKER_08]: questions for you and really valuable
insights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to kind of flip it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you come across cultivars that bag
appeal looks great, loud, smells amazing,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, lab test shows, you know,
high terpene, you know, it's a three
[SPEAKER_08]: percenter with, you know, high cannabinoid
content.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The flavor is definitely not in
conjunction of what you expect compared to
[SPEAKER_08]: the aroma.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the flavor is like rather sometimes
like the worst for me is when it's bitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it gets bitter, I'm like,
you know, I put it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So does anyone have anything to say about
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when there is in the.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of that has to do with cure,
because if cannabis is not properly cured,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're still going to have sugars in the
cellular material.
[SPEAKER_09]: And curing is about converting the sugars
into starches which burn clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sugars don't burn clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is one of the big
problems for the consumer cannabis that
[SPEAKER_09]: smells a certain way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you burn it, it tastes and smells
completely different.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're burning sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it takes time to do a proper cure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it needs moisture in the cells of the
plant material for that chemical reaction
[SPEAKER_09]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a whole art in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all I'll go back to listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a phenol hunt, if you're looking at 20
seeds of the same strain, what can happen
[SPEAKER_02]: also is they're doing selection and the
right one makes it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be like what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be perfectly cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be perfectly done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that inhale, exhale flavor or
that taste isn't there on that phenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just didn't come through on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where another one may not look as great,
but that's really coming through on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it could be selection too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see because look at the rainbow
belts right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the 3.0 and the 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're seeing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some versions of it just like
a yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some versions of it that have
all the same characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it won't yield in saltless hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it has all the same characteristics and
it does yield in saltless hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most valuable cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that's coveted that archive
owns themselves and they hold on to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only Chris gets to run and all those
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not cured correctly, then you're
not going to get that final taste and
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see the ash too might be dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not look correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all part of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even through population, each plant,
each of is going to require different
[SPEAKER_14]: things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And cure is absolutely one of them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It may require it being a little colder,
a little warmer or more humidity or less
[SPEAKER_14]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, all these things are all
attributes to what makes it viable.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we try to do this one size fits all,
especially at scale.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just not there in terms of genetics
to be able to do those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: How lucky are we, though, that this is
such a complex plant with complex,
[SPEAKER_07]: volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've got our own old factories
involved and our own systems that our
[SPEAKER_07]: perceptions and our sensitivities and our
blind spots and all of these things that
[SPEAKER_07]: just create, you know, these incredible
conversations.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, someone mentioned earlier,
like Josh was talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I froze.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always want to hear you out.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I'm just going to fill the gap
here when you can get better reception or
[SPEAKER_08]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to talk about that in terms of
how the product is grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anyone, especially the growers here,
tried different growing mediums with the
[SPEAKER_08]: same cultivar or the same product so that
you see, OK, what yields a different hash
[SPEAKER_08]: or flavor or burn quality experience?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love to chime in on that one because
I've been growing the same strain for the
[SPEAKER_13]: last, what, 18 years of everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've grown basically with different
nutrients and done a lot of testing and
[SPEAKER_13]: have had my own.
[SPEAKER_13]: HPLC sitting in the garage and I've done
all the testing and everything you guys
[SPEAKER_13]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have been kind of writing about it at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've really been taking it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where do we start with this, to be honest?
[SPEAKER_13]: Recently, Mark, we did a cleaning of some
hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did the video there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I remember during that video,
Mark, we were doing that cleaning of the
[SPEAKER_13]: heads with the Globetech.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're like, look how fresh the sweet
is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was hung dry for four months.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so knowing people don't do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So four month hang dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you thought it was still fresh.
[SPEAKER_13]: So understanding and how that cure comes
into process and how the grower comes into
[SPEAKER_13]: play, because everybody can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen everybody grow some fantastic
weed there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Half the people, 90 percent of people
don't know how to cure them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they destroy it in the process.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it comes down to is that art
is learning how to cure cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_13]: to actually hang dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all going to confirm that hang dry
is the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like you're cutting the shit
down, trimming it up, letting it dry on
[SPEAKER_13]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in machines or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've hung dry for three weeks,
three months, six months because the
[SPEAKER_13]: injuries, stuff like that, I had no
choice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then with those, it gave me this great
way of an education to see how we control
[SPEAKER_13]: the relative humidity in the room and
temperature are the key.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the hundred percent the key,
guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is how you grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody, this is how you cure your
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, this is my hallucination.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I've been understanding through the
stickiness comes down to the water
[SPEAKER_13]: activity and that cure.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is being great for me to
understand and see through time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I start my my my cures around 80
percent humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_13]: People think that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hang dry, sealed room, no fans.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're pretty big rooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can look at the amount of air that's
in that room to the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: that's in that room.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really gone into those
scientific details.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I love to work with some people and
look at some of those numbers,
[SPEAKER_13]: because I think this is going to be a
really key thing of understanding really
[SPEAKER_13]: good cannabis for the patients and people
getting those standardized therapies and
[SPEAKER_13]: that same consistency of water activity in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this comes down to that relative
humidity, to the grower and the guy curing
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to cure it properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to grow it properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that cure and then once it passes on
to that next level, we've got to hold that
[SPEAKER_13]: water activity in the jar.
[SPEAKER_13]: And whatever means you're going to use
that with there's a few products on the
[SPEAKER_13]: market.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can also keep it at a relative
humidity level and keep that in a jar.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had jars for eight, ten years and
they popped in here from 2012 when I was
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_13]: They popped and smelled just fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I knew it was in that jar at that
point.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I look at the relative humidity in
the room around 67 percent, that gives me
[SPEAKER_13]: my A.W.
[SPEAKER_13]: and my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I keep it there, 65 sometimes at 60
degrees, a little bit lower, sometimes 55.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that holds my A.W.
[SPEAKER_13]: to 58 to 59, which is perfect for smoking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now percentage of moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always kind of bad on this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe a few people might be able to
help me with those moisture levels when we
[SPEAKER_13]: look at the water activity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nick, and that moisture levels,
because for some reason, Mike,
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's wrong, but what's the most
what's the moisture level at like the 58
[SPEAKER_13]: percent in cannabis if it's an A.W.?
[SPEAKER_13]: I had it, but I'm just kind of blank on it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be between.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an image here to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just tried to post earlier about
this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on some of the isotherms that are
out there, you said between what you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: point five five or 58 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be looking at about 10.2,
10.3 percent moisture, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So 62 is at one.
[SPEAKER_00]: 62 is going to be closer to 11.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've got 10.8 and then we've got 11,
10.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.2 to 58 is going to be about 10.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, 63 is about 11,
11 and a bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something that I'm being kind
of.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and then like I think I'll be
able to incur that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no more levels at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to get any contaminants.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to go moldy.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to get any microbes or
anything going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's over the 65 percent,
if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the stock snap?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, please, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the stock will snap?
[SPEAKER_06]: The stock will snap after.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good shade tree way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I select.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the old school way, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't have a moisture meter,
but.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're ready to come off the sticks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've cured in so many different ways,
guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've cured in paper bags.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've cured in jars.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've put them in closets and we've wrapped
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many different ways of care,
of course, growing for the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've looked at different ways,
but we now control our moisture level
[SPEAKER_13]: relatively immediately in the room with
that temperature.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can hold it in that room for six
months, eight months, and I can cure that
[SPEAKER_13]: just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those turps are fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Once they go into the jar, I seal that
jar.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm opening and closing a jar all the
time, I've got a humidity pack in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have that relative humidity stay at
that level.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm putting that for the jar,
that's going to 67 percent.
[SPEAKER_13]: I seal and I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: So depending on how that's a jar,
that's an airtight, not a plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to dry out in a Ziploc bag when
we really fail.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll put a Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll throw a humidity pack in there or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where you got to kind of look at
how I've been able to see how and I've
[SPEAKER_13]: been doing this now for six over six,
seven years, really understanding
[SPEAKER_13]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_13]: The levels with Boveda, they've been kind
of working with them and over the last six
[SPEAKER_13]: years and me doing it beforehand in jars
that I've had a cure for.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had my first medicush when I won in a
jar downstairs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's 2012.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've got all of these things that I've
kind of looked at because I'm looking at a
[SPEAKER_13]: standardization for myself so I can
consume cannabis for the turpies.
[SPEAKER_13]: They give me that joy.
[SPEAKER_13]: They give me that pain relief.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I need.
[SPEAKER_13]: I need the consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: The turpies are quite high.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lady asked me, what were you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: She goes, what are your turpies?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to do a total darkness for a couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I control my relative humidity,
my room, everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I turn up my lights and I just look at
different ways.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done that now for the last year and a
bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm about four crops now and I'm actually
seeing those turpies higher by two weeks
[SPEAKER_13]: light.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do a full feed, full water,
not feed, sorry, full water, turn the
[SPEAKER_13]: lights up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have that room completely controlled for
humidity and temperature, of course,
[SPEAKER_13]: and no lights on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I go in there and just before
they dry out completely, I cut them down
[SPEAKER_13]: and hang them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's been that next little extra
push on those turpies completely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've really seen a big change in that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope you guys will.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure that room is controlled.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you do not have a controlled room,
you will cause mold.
[SPEAKER_13]: You will cause problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: Please do not do this unless you're doing
this and you know what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_13]: do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have no problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: I test things and I'm willing to like
always fail because that's how you learn
[SPEAKER_13]: 20% of the problem, 80% of the solution.
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are the things that I've been
able to find through time and what I've
[SPEAKER_13]: been doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just my hallucinations of how
I've kind of worked towards what I need
[SPEAKER_13]: for myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I've done with the same stream and
I've been growing with all different
[SPEAKER_13]: lights, many Kush and my stream,
the same stream for the last over a decade
[SPEAKER_13]: and a bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And between lights and nutrients,
living soils by far is more flavor.
[SPEAKER_13]: LEDs, of course, I'm using because I like
the far red.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like those deep reds.
[SPEAKER_13]: They give me that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's organic.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys all know that, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Organics is the way to go to get the
flavors hang dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, and add the biology into your
soils and golden soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to grow for the future.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can't do that with the nutrients
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And really understanding that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not curing and using proper light recipes
and multiple spectrums and how they can
[SPEAKER_13]: cut down on just this overall and be
self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a key importance.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is why I love doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I get the joy from you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for allowing me to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: John, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched on a bunch of things I'm
really interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ones I think for me,
I'll touch on the organic thing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the light depth the last two weeks,
that's interesting because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are there's the bro science aspect where
people are doing it for a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 hours, and that's not enough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you have measurements on that by
any chance?
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got some stuff to be looking at and
get some testing done a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm always trying to get that done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I'm getting more help with some
people looking at it because I've had some
[SPEAKER_13]: people looking at what I'm testing for me
because everything does cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would love to see any data that
you're willing to share because I would
[SPEAKER_00]: just love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I put my contact information
earlier in the chat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll send it to you actually in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of organic versus inorganic,
one of the things that I have noticed is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a lot of confusion between
organic and sustainable and a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: microflora environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that absolutely having the
microflora and the right bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: right soil fungi are the most important
aspect of what organic farming set out to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the right balance of nutrients
and the right form of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can achieve those results with
so-called non-organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is more about keeping the
soil healthy and not just overloading it
[SPEAKER_00]: with really heavy salts and leading to
oversalting and nutrient imbalance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an important
distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like people to start experimenting
with perhaps sustainable non-organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients as well and to do tests on that
and see if you can achieve the same
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, but just making sure that you
have the right nutrients in the right form
[SPEAKER_00]: available to those microbes to then
liberate them for the plant at a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, sustainable rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that would be a really nice
experiment to try.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'd like to speak to that a bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've grown across the spectrum for sure,
and I'm definitely a living soil guru,
[SPEAKER_15]: so I've self-proclaimed I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really into it for sustainability
reasons.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I feel like there's something which we
can't scientifically prove, but all of our
[SPEAKER_15]: mouths will verify that as the living soil
stuff, hands down, comes out 100% better.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's better for the way it is in your
body.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's better for the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even the most hardcore guys run a really
tight, really nice game and will say,
[SPEAKER_15]: man, your shit is better.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll go, but I get better yield.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll have their reasons for why they
stick you in their thing, but they'll
[SPEAKER_15]: always say, your shit went better.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with what you're saying in large
part, Nick, that a lot of folks are
[SPEAKER_15]: messing their new game up and they could
dial it in and they need to have the
[SPEAKER_15]: ability to have some biology in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_15]: And some of these new companies will
actually have probiotics that they add in.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are like a lot better tasting.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're closer, but they don't hit the
same homeostasis thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's also a genetic thing too.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wonder if Johnny B experienced this.
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I take in different cuts,
and I've noticed this for decades,
[SPEAKER_15]: if I take in a cut, let's say from a guy
who's been running synthetics for years,
[SPEAKER_15]: it'll take me two, three, four cycles
growing that plant until that plant knows
[SPEAKER_15]: how to use those organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's literally in the cell walls of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: It takes time for the plant to get the
right microbes inside the cell walls to
[SPEAKER_15]: work and really metabolize and fucking
crank.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's in the seed and through the
clone.
[SPEAKER_15]: It can take a little bit on some lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: That being said, I have a line in ATF that
has never, and I've had this thing for
[SPEAKER_15]: like 15 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has never shown me the best.
[SPEAKER_15]: It shows the best quality when growing in
synthetics under HPS.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had it for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: I fucked with it in LED, HPS, living
soils.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've done all the things, and this one
just loves to have a drain to waste,
[SPEAKER_15]: HPS, fucking hot game.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a genetic component.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a number of things going on there.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think everyone in the room,
most people, I won't speak for them,
[SPEAKER_15]: agree that there's something in the mouth
that we can't scientifically say and
[SPEAKER_15]: quantify that living soil done proper,
cured proper, is hands down better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say we can't scientifically prove
it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I'm doing a lot of the work
that I'm trying to do is not to remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: artistry or to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more just to quantify whatever we can
so that we can grow what we want and learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting when you mentioned
about your ATF, because one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that, back to what John was saying
earlier, one of the reasons that living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is so good is that you have a
consistent infusion of complex organic
[SPEAKER_00]: soups, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean organic in terms of the
TM, organic farming system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean just like organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as those degrade, they'll release
different micronutrients consistently over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that the micronutrients and
feeding the soil is absolutely the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way you can do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way that agriculture should
be moving and is moving, thankfully,
[SPEAKER_00]: finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's feed the soil, and you get better
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you feed the soil is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see differences depending on
the intensity of your fertilization and
[SPEAKER_00]: even what forms those come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying is that the higher the
biodiversity, the higher the complexity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the system, the more resilient it is and
the more resilient it is to change and to
[SPEAKER_00]: shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a better buffering capacity,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily from a chemical
perspective, but sometimes, but more from
[SPEAKER_00]: a resistance to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really, I mean, there's a
seminal paper in sort of sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture that came out in the early
2000s, looking at suavignon grapes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Marlboro Valley of New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found is that the absolute
best aromatics came from vineyards and
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly sides of vineyards that were
closer to unfarmed wild land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were getting this migration of
microbes and also some multicellular bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that that were bringing in
this biodiversity that led to a
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly and measurably different and
higher level of VOCs in the grapes and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the wines that were produced from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just, to me, speaks to the fact
that the higher the biodiversity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier the soil, the more complex that
ecosystem is, the more complex production
[SPEAKER_00]: of organic compounds and aromatics that
you're gonna get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're agreeing that the
more complexity and the healthier the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system is and the healthier the
microenvironment is, the better the
[SPEAKER_00]: product is gonna be and the safer it is
for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I feel like we could also agree
that the more times a thing is eaten,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if I throw an alfalfa meal down on
the top soil, let it be consumed by the
[SPEAKER_15]: microbes versus if I feed it to my goat
and then take that goat poop and process
[SPEAKER_15]: it through a compost.
[SPEAKER_15]: The more times you can get things eaten in
chat and eating in chat, you create
[SPEAKER_15]: diversity and achieve that is one aspect.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree totally with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and sort of along those lines,
like if you continuously feed the same
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen, you're going to be training your
environment to subsist on those inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can do it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do like really consistent regimen
of the same things and you'll probably get
[SPEAKER_00]: a fairly stable environment that will
produce consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is about consistency and this is
what the 800 pound mantra, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually know your name, sir, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I can't hear you.
Addison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addison, okay, thanks man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addison was saying is that consistency is
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could go the opposite direction
and feed looking at the micronutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: the macronutrients and feed multiple
different sources of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously to try to promote an even
larger biodiversity and a flexibility in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient uptake and nutrient consumption
for that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's probably some,
it'd be interesting to compare results
[SPEAKER_00]: from both of those approaches.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to jump in here for a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm loving this conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: First part I wanted to talk about was the
idea of creating your own inputs.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a bunch of reasons that I think
that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the idea of biodiversity in your
garden, particularly if you're able to
[SPEAKER_09]: work outdoors or in living soil,
[SPEAKER_09]: the organisms that are flourishing in the
soil you have, not in your garden,
[SPEAKER_09]: but around your garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: To your point, Nick, about seeing better
results from grapes near the edge of a
[SPEAKER_09]: vineyard as versus in the middle of it,
because the microorganisms that are in the
[SPEAKER_09]: wild land, if you will, have a chance to
get into the vineyard and add to the
[SPEAKER_09]: diversity of the microscopic life that's
happening there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that one of the memories I
have, I believe it was on Hash Church a
[SPEAKER_09]: while back, we talked about terpenes and
someone was here presenting the idea that
[SPEAKER_09]: while genetics have something to play in
the genetic expression, in the expression
[SPEAKER_09]: of terpenes and cannabis, that the
microorganisms that are in the root zone,
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as on the leaf surfaces and within
the plant itself also trigger terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: response from the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tend to think of it that the
cannabis plant, at least part of why it's
[SPEAKER_09]: creating these terpenes, is for its own
needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We enjoy them, but they are at least
partially about a defense mechanism to
[SPEAKER_09]: discourage things that eat plants from
eating the leaves of this plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's also, of course, the terpenes
and their effects on our body and why we
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivate them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, just as a way to
encourage interactions with pollinators,
[SPEAKER_06]: which us humans are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the cannabis plant, and all plants for
that matter, and all insects for that
[SPEAKER_06]: matter, live in a world called chemical
ecology.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a whole branch of chemistry that
describes the chemical language that it
[SPEAKER_06]: exists between different organisms,
including plants and insects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's truly amazing, when you look at
the chemicals that insects use to
[SPEAKER_06]: communicate with, they're some of the same
molecules that are in plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some of the same biochemical
pathways and some of the same signals that
[SPEAKER_06]: are responsible for those molecules in
plants are also in insects.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just end by saying this.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we worked on this project with
catmint, we had not realized the
[SPEAKER_06]: importance that catmint has in it is a
good insect repellent, but it's a lacewing
[SPEAKER_06]: attractant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And lacewings are the good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a hugely important point,
because it's not only just for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators, but it's also for predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what will happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this whole communication that's
happening there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think humans, right, Wade?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're involved in that communication,
because it's like there's insects,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's plants, there's people,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's the earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think just to go back to the
chemical communication again, that's
[SPEAKER_06]: really cool is that when you look at
certain varieties and susceptibility to
[SPEAKER_06]: either insect or microbial attack,
whether it's fungal or by microbes or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever, there is a chemical basis for
certain varieties that are resistant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that all has to do with, again,
terpene makeup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume the other chemicals also
play a role, but I think terpene makeup
[SPEAKER_06]: has a big role.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were talking before, too,
about microbial influence, too,
[SPEAKER_06]: on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to admit, too, that, again,
the hallmark of microbial degradation is
[SPEAKER_06]: oxidation, because that's what microbes
want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to oxidize things when they eat
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes, like when you look at Al
Soli's papers, he identifies all of these
[SPEAKER_06]: new cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically microbial degradation
products of moldy weed down at Ole Miss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so in its pristine form,
yes, cannabinoids and terpenes in general
[SPEAKER_06]: are metastable compounds, so they have to
be preserved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's interesting, Addison,
what you're saying about this notion of,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, you can't keep it as flour,
so make it in the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to have that as like hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it to be buried in a hash casket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to write that into my will.
[SPEAKER_14]: Addison, what you were saying earlier is
the truth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like hash wants to make it into that form.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know Marcus, he's been a big
proponent of this for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: The more hash you make, you can freeze it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can keep it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can pull it out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can use it at any point in time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has longevity.
[SPEAKER_14]: And resin done well with the right amount
of resin to particulate ratios can last a
[SPEAKER_14]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash is like Walt Disney's head.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you freeze it, keep that shit forever,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Preservation is real, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why the supply chain
conversation that Nick brought up is so
[SPEAKER_07]: very, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that lots of critics of what's
going on in the legal market in Canada,
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some companies, many companies
growing boof, and there's companies not
[SPEAKER_07]: processing correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are also great people who are
from the legacy market growing really nice
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are people processing really
nice products.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I kept my hash at minus 20 degrees
the entire time I had it, then I sent it
[SPEAKER_07]: out in jars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it went to the warehouse in the OCS.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sat for three days in the summer at
like 100 degrees Fahrenheit in their
[SPEAKER_07]: warehouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Addison was saying, when you remove
the nitrogen, oxygen, and replace with
[SPEAKER_07]: nitrogen, it degrades very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you keep hash stored for six
months plus at minus 20 degrees,
[SPEAKER_07]: minus 20 degrees Celsius, and then you go
to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it literally
[SPEAKER_07]: cooks the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the hash was like reddish black.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, from being a white powder,
it just turned into this like smeared red,
[SPEAKER_07]: black powder, or black gum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, it's like we took a lot of hits
from people going, oh, they're selling
[SPEAKER_07]: bunk and it's not that good.
[SPEAKER_07]: There really is something to be said for a
good product can be destroyed with a bad
[SPEAKER_07]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's packaging, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every component is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I think as we progress,
like every other industry has that has
[SPEAKER_02]: less barriers, you will solve these
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And great companies will come forward and
introduce these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And new pioneers will be made.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the exciting part about what's next
in what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everything's come so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's even with with legends,
like, for example, every single entry that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes into legends goes immediately into a
chest freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stays in that chest freezer until
it gets, you know, as we make the kits for
[SPEAKER_02]: the judges, those are all in free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like everything's protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is because it's our job to
give it to the person who comes up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash bar in the same format that it was
turned in as an entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now we're talking about solving
this hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just want to make sure that it's
that that maker is getting we're
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting that maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're representing them at that moment
that we hand that over to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I expect there to be a lot
of people with coolers and we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be giving out ice packs for people and
replenishing ice packs while we're there
[SPEAKER_02]: because it because it is solventless and
people want to protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you want that when you
don't bring it all with you, but now
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to make sure that it's
protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we even thought about like going to
Pelican or like not Pelican, but go into
[SPEAKER_02]: like one of the bigger, cooler companies
and being like, hey, do you want to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have this product that has to
stay cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we're ready for that
kind of stuff yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, all this great work all the
way through the process at so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different points can break down and change
and destroy the art, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy the work that somebody did because
of supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, supply chain isn't just the
supply of the material that's being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also that material getting itself to
the market and getting out there to the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's it's everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is like if people are bored of
cannabis right now and you want to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: new direction, supply chain is a very
interesting one and it pays pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually like a nice place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not as much I'm probably going to
regret saying this, but it's not there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not as much competition and craziness in
that space because everyone's focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: being the fucking the rock star or,
you know, the other guy that's doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but it is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen it many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm sure, Marcus, people were
getting that hash and being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always knew bubble man was full of shit
like this is trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they they want to quickly jump
at you and talk some shit or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, is the way culture is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's that's what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it looked like when it left
when it left my facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and now I'll show you what it looks
like now after it sat in at the OCF.
[SPEAKER_07]: For three days in a jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now this was taken with a macro.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I showed it to you out, not in the
macro, you can still see the quality is
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not telling you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'll show you what I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think of what's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a lot of volatile organic
compounds.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of these are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Addison, like you were saying
earlier, like we need is a farm to face
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply chain control and to your thing
for legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you offer advice for the supplier,
for the growers or submitting for judging
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you say actually this is how we
want you to pack it to show off your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you give them a standard so you're so
everybody's getting judged equally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we explain to them that it's
important to us that we're putting their
[SPEAKER_02]: product the way they present it to us,
exactly to whoever's coming up to that
[SPEAKER_02]: hash bar to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, to every attendee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really you know, we have that
conversation with them about, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, here's the dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's you know, it's called weights and
dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this is the weights of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's all the dates, important dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's all the other information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big part of it is like,
you know, what are you turning in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing one or two entries?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these entries?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because it could be one or two
entries, it could be three or four
entries.
So, you know, it's a lot of different
categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whether it's rousing this year,
it's it's melt or dry sift or rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's three different categories that
are all judged separately and they'll be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, awards for each one in each
category.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all completely split up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have the conversation with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, oh, you're entering a melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's talk about how,
you know, that's coming in or how we're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting that and the dates that it has to
be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, because they're also there's
a jar sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calix containers sponsors all the jars
because we we feel like that jar is the
[SPEAKER_02]: most it's the best jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have melt from since that jar
was first introduced to the market that we
[SPEAKER_02]: put into those jars and had, you know,
and it's still good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I just smoked some
yesterday and it was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, so we really
appreciate that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's there's a lot of thought
that goes into it, including the film
[SPEAKER_02]: that's added to the jar to cover the top
of the jars on the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we we do a lot of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all sort of in line with exactly what
I'm talking about, making sure from the
[SPEAKER_02]: jar to the way it's treated, to how they
give it to us, that it's presented exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: that way to whoever is going to look at
the bottom of the jar, see the sticker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legends isn't blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each company puts their their logo and
their strain name and possibly the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: and possibly the farmer on the bottom of
that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every single one that you look at,
oh, that's what it looked like after.
[SPEAKER_07]: This, by the way, is 14 year old Master
Kush bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: If everyone's wondering why it's so dark,
sorry that it's not the blonde blonde
[SPEAKER_07]: blonde.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is a perfect example of hash that
the volatile organic compounds have
[SPEAKER_07]: changed completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the most different.
[SPEAKER_07]: This stuff tastes like perfume.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how, because it's just
been in this jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was out on my table for years,
but it's sealed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sealed in a way where those compounds
somehow transformed and preserved without
[SPEAKER_07]: a freezer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not seen that happen many times
personally, but it is just as you were
[SPEAKER_07]: talking, I thought I would show a few
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that particular hash is extremely
special.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to mention too, you know,
we're having this conversation and we're
[SPEAKER_07]: wondering what can we do, you know,
to sort of bring this to the people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Julie's like, how do we get these people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have events.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have events and that's what
the Legends of Hash event is all about
[SPEAKER_07]: down in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Julie's Collector's Cup,
which we'll talk about in a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: that's happening up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you have something like
Legends and you're inviting the best
[SPEAKER_07]: growers, you know, we were asked when we
were interviewed the other day,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, oh, what's the equality outcome?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how are you guys making it like
equal for all?
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like, oh, oh, it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're completely prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't care what the people look like,
but we're prejudiced about what the hash
[SPEAKER_07]: looks and smells like.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what this event is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an equality event.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an event to make sure whoever you
are, whatever walk of life you've come
[SPEAKER_07]: from, that you bring what you think is
going to be that great thing to the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's that sort of community of
hashish aficionados getting together and
[SPEAKER_07]: why the growers are so important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Put your money where your mouth is.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have to argue about, you know,
organic regenerative is better than salt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I think a lot of us feel that
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, Nick had me really
thinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate his scientific mind,
because he's certainly not saying salts
[SPEAKER_07]: are better.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just saying, is there a way that we
can like, it's almost like a conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: about medicine and you've got your Western
medicine and you've got your Eastern
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't we know that the best version
is both of those together?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always we're always dividing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm saying people that are
organic and regenerative farmers need to
[SPEAKER_07]: be pump and salted.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try not to hear that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying that the possibility that
there's value on both sides and
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding, feeding your soil what it
needs can be learned from both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it can bring you to a place that
pulls those two sides together,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's very hard for a bird to fly with one
wing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we have both wings of that bird,
we get what we call, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that that just beautiful flowing state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are just a few things I wanted
to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to do with the region conference,
you know, and I feel like we made a little
[SPEAKER_15]: dent in that, you know, that all compost
is not equal and that by no means is
[SPEAKER_15]: compost equal and not all microbes are
equal by no means.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we try we try to really incorporate
like let's focus on the individual parts
[SPEAKER_15]: of the science of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's focus on testing and let's get down
to what we're regenerative to me really is
[SPEAKER_15]: using less.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we're just aimlessly throwing
carbon and nitrogen at the at the product
[SPEAKER_15]: problem rather than saying, oh,
we're lacking this through a leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_15]: test and adding it micro through a foliar,
you know, like I think I didn't mean to
[SPEAKER_15]: come off so hot Nick earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just kind of can't be a little hot
Italian.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you came across passionate,
not hot at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: You came across loving like, listen,
I will defend my organic living.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not hear this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am into this shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, guys, I want to share something with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I met this gentleman, Gary, at this event
I was at.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this guy's so into what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to play this for you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you hear him?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so what's going to happen is I'm
going to send this off to Josh and Nick.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this guy here is all about we're
talking about on a map.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was such an awesome conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to be able to share this with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I get a chance, I'm going to have
a meeting with this gentleman.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's exactly what you're talking about
on a massive thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some new creations that they came
up with.
[SPEAKER_13]: I filmed him talking about what you're
talking about, but I will share it with
[SPEAKER_13]: you guys and somehow share it with the
group here someday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Post it on Hashchurch, man, in the forum.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll post it on Hashchurch.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gary will love this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's just an amazing individual and
Wade, you and him would probably be best
[SPEAKER_13]: friends, honestly, on the farming end and
the regenerative for the soils and the
[SPEAKER_13]: biology.
[SPEAKER_13]: He wants to do things on the rainforest on
the edge as they're coming into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's doing some pretty amazing things on
an international level.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is just a conversation for you
like-minded individuals to work with a
[SPEAKER_13]: gentleman like this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for allowing me to share
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will continue on what you're talking
about, please.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just was excited that we were in that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, I got to jump off in about 30
minutes, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you wanted to talk about legends or
if there was questions or anything else
[SPEAKER_02]: about this year, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get back to this conversation
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got a little bit of time and
legends is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make time to talk about Julie's
and the Canareps Collector's Cup as well
[SPEAKER_07]: as happening here in Canada and three
cities.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's start off with legends and just
a little bit of information for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly what everyone asks is how they can
get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's usually where it starts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so maybe you can let the answer out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the biggest question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer to it is that I think as
organizers and producers of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: we look at that as the hardest decision to
make is who could actually be on that list
[SPEAKER_02]: and who can come that year.
And I think that's one of the things that
we've been able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been able to bring together from the
maker all the way into the attendees that
[SPEAKER_02]: get to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to alleviate that issue a
little bit this year by introducing all
[SPEAKER_02]: the judging and giving the judges
essentially 21 hours to judge and the
[SPEAKER_02]: judges are the makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it came down to, you know, we had to
put a system in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, our job is to not just
put on an event, but figure out how to
[SPEAKER_02]: monetize it correctly with the culture and
involve it in the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means to involve sponsors,
but they have to be very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't just be, you know, oh,
the biggest dabber producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, let's let's look at Mystic
Timbers, which is one of the longest
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting, you know, dabber producers that
has that as a family owned company and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these different things that go into
selecting the sponsors all the way down
[SPEAKER_02]: into, then you start moving through the
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we introduced is we do the list
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the list of makers, we get that decided
on as early as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as the years kind of maturing,
we're already sitting there doing posts
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing stuff to figure out that list
and who's going to be involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at the winners of other
events, other things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: qualifiers, and then being able to put
them on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second is the guest list or the attendee
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of the first night dinner list is
really the guest of the maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have 40 makers, then those 40
makers get a guest, which puts an 80
[SPEAKER_02]: person guest list up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have 150 people the first night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have about 70 people that then are
coming in at an attendee, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a two day attendee list.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way we build that list is the same way
we start early and we're putting people in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that are, you know, it's mainly the
owners of some of these sponsors,
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest sponsors and, you know,
that fit really well with the culture or
[SPEAKER_02]: other, you know, producers, manufacturers
that don't enter contests, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely a big part of the culture from
the product side to the merch side to
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Artists, other people that just are really
part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the second qualifier for that
person is do they consume a lot of hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this isn't, you know, it's not to
say that any event is just, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this isn't a small event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over a hundred thousand dollars in
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot that goes into it and those
sponsors make that possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to make sure that the
experience for every single attendee from
[SPEAKER_02]: the maker all the way down to the,
you know, the second day brunch attendee
[SPEAKER_05]: get, you know, has a rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go up to the bar and you say,
Hey, I'd like to sample from the menu or
[SPEAKER_02]: sample from the entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a quick, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the next five or six entries to
try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those are according to the
program entry, you know, the servings,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's enough to go back and sit down
and try stuff and mosey back up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: line and get some more and have that real
open feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I went to legends, that's how it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: We walked up and there was stuff on the
table and I cut a little piece of this and
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled a little piece of that,
put on a paper plate and circled in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, did the whole dance and did that
and kind of got to experience the product
[SPEAKER_02]: with the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could then sit down next to,
you know, whoever and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, that's the same experience
that we're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can, the hash is all dispersed
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The makers get a kit and then the makers
have access to a half gram entry size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, we keep the bar that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's a lanyard, everything
this year, because we added judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, we have a blockchain that we
created with the partnership that's on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on the web three have our own
blockchain, our own coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Dow, everything that exists
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all from the hash and glass
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And created a format so that we can have
all of our judging on web three.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all transparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can publish it after everyone can look
at it and see who judged and what they
[SPEAKER_02]: judged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way it's a system that we
can then, you know, legends Marcus and
[SPEAKER_02]: myself can turn to anyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dave, when we could turn and say,
Hey, here's our platform, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to Emerald cup or anyone else,
you can use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're you're the person who's using it
just goes into their phone, uses a sliding
[SPEAKER_02]: scale and gets to fine tune the actual
judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it eliminates more, more possibility of
ties and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, we built a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely secure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hundred percent publishable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another part that we've kind of
added this year is the judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the second day exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But only the makers will judge and they'll
judge one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's best way to do it because it
eliminates any issue of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a coup that's all voting for so-and-so for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, I think it's going to be,
you know, it's bigger this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 400 person venue, but we'll only
have 250 or 275 people there max,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, you know, gives us much more
room for, you know, our sponsors to have
[SPEAKER_02]: booths outside and the outside has more of
a, you know, a little bit of a trade show
[SPEAKER_02]: feel, but then the inside has more of an
intimate seating, very comfortable,
[SPEAKER_02]: large farm tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we feel like that's the most
sturdy table that we can get and the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest seating space we can have
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no ropes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no excluded, you know,
sections that are roped off or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's there together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only specific area for seating is the
sponsor seating area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's closer to the outside so that
those guys are able to get more quickly in
[SPEAKER_02]: and out and enjoy the experience as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we have the lanyards and the
laminates this year again, and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: qualify the different, you know,
attendees with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as, you know, now your ticket is
an NFT.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be on your phone through a Kepler
wallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll show that when you come in and
then that qualifies who the person is,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're there for, whether they're
going to be a judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought someone was saying
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's the... I would add
something, Addison.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you guys are doing is a lot harder
than what I did because I did let the
[SPEAKER_07]: legend from this purely heart place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It came from this pure aficionado place,
which I don't doubt we're still coming
[SPEAKER_07]: from that same place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to monetize it was the thing I was
just always too afraid to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we had our conversation about,
like, look, like, you can't just keep
[SPEAKER_07]: paying for this out of your pocket,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this is fucking mental.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, people want to come to this event.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to enjoy the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to popularize new strains and
flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to have this experience in the
culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things you didn't really
talk about because you were so,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, into talking about this future,
which is actually pretty incredible,
[SPEAKER_07]: the Kepler wallet and the NFT and the
whole way, the transparency of the
[SPEAKER_07]: competition work.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you take away that sort of temptation
of like, oh, let's just sell the first,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like what people inevitably do
when they build something big,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to, like, preserve it in the
early days and the foundation of it to
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that it doesn't get bastardized,
which is a very hard thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure there's already people who
went to the original legends or like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, they took sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're allowing cameras.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not the same anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not the same anymore,
but it is same, same, but different.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've ever been to Thailand,
it's still going to have its soul of
[SPEAKER_07]: legends, but we're going to allow more
people to be involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to, it's just like the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people always say, oh, it's selling
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's the, it's the, at one point in
time, you have to monetize it and get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to just have legends with 40
people every year?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to do legends where maybe some
thousands of people can experience it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to make it so, you know,
you're growing weed for like the 10 people
[SPEAKER_07]: in your neighborhood, or do you want to
make it so you could touch people on the
[SPEAKER_07]: other side of the country to taste your
flavors as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is kind of the difficulty as we
get older, we come from the roots,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're all these activists and we're
fighting and fighting and fighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then suddenly one day you realize,
oh my gosh, I'm running a business and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's incorporated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's, I've got to, you know,
I've got to do all of these different
[SPEAKER_07]: things to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting kind of situation,
but I, I feel that legends is in good
[SPEAKER_07]: hands with, with you guys and with myself
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just excited that, you know,
recently a bubble coal from Instagram hit
[SPEAKER_07]: me up and started sending me pictures from
Afghanistan and my frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And started, and, and he's, he said,
I've been writing all these articles about
[SPEAKER_07]: preserving the culture in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but the Taliban is searching for me
and I had to leave the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought, Whoa, so this is another
part of legends.
[SPEAKER_07]: The roots like, so I say, well,
can we publish some of your stories?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we make some placards for legends of
hash with your words?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we use some of your pictures?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, he's just like, yes,
of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yes, I want, I want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the circle of hashish that I sent
Addison the other day in Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_07]: he sent me this photo just to share it
really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm hoping on getting some of these
photographs, you know, this is the,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is the circle of hashish that I sent
to Baba coal, like taken last year in
[SPEAKER_07]: Afghanistan, where they gather and join
and they smoke all this hash inside this
[SPEAKER_07]: little chamber.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I love the idea that here's this
guy, he's got Instagram, but he's looking
[SPEAKER_07]: for a place to preserve these stories and
get these photos seen by a group of people
[SPEAKER_07]: that actually have an appreciation for
hashish.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here it is going to be legends,
legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the event is more than just some
event.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also the preservation of our culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cultures of hashish.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can't, you know, it's not about
picking one or the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about preserving them all in the most
authentic way that we can while
[SPEAKER_07]: continually continuing to grow that
culture in the world we live in today and
[SPEAKER_07]: honoring and praising the genetics and the
growers who spend their time and spend
[SPEAKER_07]: months and months of variables to produce
these incredible flavors for the hash
[SPEAKER_07]: makers to then come along and process with
them utmost care and love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And gentleness to bring to an event.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a hash bar that you can walk up to
from the menu and just, Oh, give me a
[SPEAKER_07]: quarter gram of that and a quarter gram of
this and give me two quarter grams of
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that is, that is something I want to
see more of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you had anything else to say,
Addison, feel free to say it, but I've
[SPEAKER_07]: said my piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can, you can see more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a ticket for you if you want to
come down, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be awesome to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know, you know, maybe like put a
month, just cut a mustache or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can get you down, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just, just, just as though it was just
a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, and more importantly,
how does one get a judging spot if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not, if they're not a maker or if should I
just start making.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever, I think we're never going to
go above 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 40 is like a great way to have the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may go less, definitely not more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's, you know, that's a good
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it's a good number,
because it sort of hits there,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to, we want to make that an odd
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we add five judges that we consider
respected by the 40 makers guys that
[SPEAKER_02]: really know their shit that are,
that are kind of what you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not necessarily the maker,
but maybe Scott Debbie, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and not necessarily the maker,
but maybe JP Toro and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot comedy guys that smoke a lot of hash
and have smoke hash and know the culture
[SPEAKER_02]: and know all the makers and know
everything.
And so I think, I think that's the whole
point of it.
And I think this is a huge advantage to
have a judge that can come in to the room
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of sit up in the room and talk to
everybody and can kind of sit in that room
[SPEAKER_02]: and again, 60 entries in 21 hours and
being able to give your full opinion on
[SPEAKER_02]: those 60, however that may be,
whatever process you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I look at it as familiarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of the people that are judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are incredibly familiar with the entire
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dab, you know, they're dabbing three
and a half grams a day, three grams a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: two grams a day on the daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just part of what they're putting
into themselves and how much exposure they
[SPEAKER_02]: have to hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of why that maker's list,
that judge list is so small that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to have that exposure in order to be able
to do that, in order to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's crazy about this is I've seen
this multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's honestly done and you look at
the results, it's across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it sort of uniformly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pick the right judges, you could
see it uniformly in those judges where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all, you know, someone may bring
something from left field here and there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can tell that nothing's fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh, okay, look at these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, look at the judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is favoring and a favoring and
not favoring the entries that came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that in a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that you pick the right
kind of judges and you had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, you know, there's 18 months
of thought that goes into and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: returning and kind of putting together the
process from what we did last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took feedback from all of the makers
that came last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we said, okay, can we implement
these things and still keep it in line
[SPEAKER_02]: with culture while we monetize it,
while we, you know, continue to give
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks back to and telling the story of
hashish and the history of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's even the way we put
the tickets out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the second day, the brunch has
75 tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can go out for that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that gives us an opportunity now to
bring in makers that we weren't able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get on the list, to bring in glass shop
owners that really helped push the culture
[SPEAKER_02]: by selling the glass and putting that
stuff out and consuming a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every single person that's there
consumes a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All 250 people are hand selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we go through and look at every
single person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're either putting their name on the
list to start, or we're getting their name
[SPEAKER_02]: and then reviewing it and kind of vetting
it and presenting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like Marcus says, it's a sifting
through the heads of all these people and
[SPEAKER_02]: then putting together that perfect 90,
120, that's just kind of, oh, fuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's, when we're putting it
together, our whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like OKR, like outcomes and key results,
what we're really looking for is for that
[SPEAKER_02]: person to stand there in the room,
for any person in the room to walk in and
[SPEAKER_02]: be standing at any point and look around
and just, and take it in and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to be fucking kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how the fuck is this even possible
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, from the place that they
get to sit to the entire design of the
[SPEAKER_02]: motif that's there, it's all Moroccan,
all, you know, flowing curtains and
[SPEAKER_02]: pillows and floor seating, all these
different things and lamps and lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything is all to bring that to
life in this large space, indoor and
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the outdoor tents have rugs and other
stuff laid down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, you know, very,
very solid experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the food, you know, the food,
the first night is all Lebanese meal,
[SPEAKER_02]: full spread of Lebanese from a caterer
that can do the whole, the whole rip for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second day is a prime rib
brunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be cutting the prime rib there and
then we'll have eggs and everything else
[SPEAKER_02]: for brunch that that's available,
a full coffee bar that's totally free that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get lattes and all that different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they'll have like,
Marcus, they'll have the Legends of
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashi's logo on all the lattes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get your latte, they can do
some different ones, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have that all the way into
bakery, you know, all the pastries and the
[SPEAKER_02]: bakery stuff that's there for brunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the first time, we'll have a
Legends award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the first time, we'll actually
have media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've invited Bearded Brothers Media to
do all of our online media stuff with us,
[SPEAKER_02]: digital stuff that'll be out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we invited Sensi Magazine as our,
you know, in print, you know, if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a thing anymore, really just
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we selected those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love working with Ron and those guys
and Jennifer who's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's who's covering the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we ourselves have a pretty extensive
media team that's gonna capture running up
[SPEAKER_02]: to Legends with the intake all the way
into the, you know, the post-production or
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-production of the event, into the
event, covering all of the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: there, very creatively too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, you know, creating,
like taking light tables, lighting up a
[SPEAKER_02]: space, and then the, and then,
you know, being smart enough to showcase
[SPEAKER_02]: the glass rigs that will be in the room
that day, and then have them come in and
[SPEAKER_02]: hit off the rigs and do videos in that one
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do mac, what is it,
macro, micro photography or macro
[SPEAKER_02]: photography on all of the entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens days before the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: After everything's turned in, we start
that process and get photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the production, the post-production
of the entire event, there'll be,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll all be in, unfortunately this is
how it is now, but everything will be in
[SPEAKER_02]: snips.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these produced reels that will
have all of the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's some of the stuff from last
year, the entry stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll use the same photographer this
year, Zoom photography that did everything
[SPEAKER_02]: for us last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, those are some of the great
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Feeling Frosty's, Jealousy Cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so we'll have capture this year
on all the entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have media there covering stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's allowed to have their phone
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there should be a lot more activity on
social media and things like that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's, you know, again,
it's a private dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's totally private.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a completely closed, you know,
system that we put in place to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're having a private dinner and
everybody who's there is invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it's also just a
really well-curated room of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's two days this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided that instead of producing an
award that someone has, it's kind of this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that sits around or does whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought it would be better to,
you know, a better situation to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: the sponsors and build gift baskets for
first place, second place, and third place
[SPEAKER_02]: in each category with different unique
products from those guys like Terpsie V
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, there's a lot of different
ones that have these great products that
[SPEAKER_02]: they, that we can then put together from,
you know, a custom slurper from Toro or a
[SPEAKER_02]: custom glass, you know, sculpture from
Mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff will be, the first place
winners will have a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: things like a cornucopia of stuff that
they're getting from the companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a nice slurper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: JP Toro is one of the sponsors with,
with Toro Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mothership's a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crazy list.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's Terpsie V, Banger Bass,
Little Lake Valley Seed Code, Masonic,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Timbers, Octave, Mothership,
710 Merch, Alien Labs, Toro Glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: Videl, Agritech, Glob Mops, Focus V and
Carta, Highly Educated, Rosin Evolution,
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean Pumps, Apex Ancillary, Alchemy Jars,
Mills.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, even probably a couple more
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Cali-X just got in sponsorship in
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all brands that fit really well
that are part of our culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Banger Basket and these like
cool companies that are, that are part of
[SPEAKER_02]: our culture that are, that are just help
make up a great event too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the, you know, every table has
Banger Baskets on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ISO, there's Butane, there's all
the things you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really just need to bring your rig,
you know, bring your torch and your other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but all the other little details
that are needed are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different companies that
are doing drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're exclusive to the event from their
mood mats to their tees and other things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the makers, all the way into some
of the other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the art component,
which is all done by our, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in-house through Howdy on Instagram,
who does all of our stuff for us,
[SPEAKER_02]: including our poster that we just released
for this year's Legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Lock Comedy is, is working with
us on, you know, he's a hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: dead culture, cannabis culture guy who's
an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's kind of helping us, you know,
cover that component and make that a big
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the event too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some other surprises that we've
kind of put together with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the, there's this year's
poster and there's a ton of hidden stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: in it, a bunch of different symbolisms and
other cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, we'll have Lock Comedy is
also going to be presenting and have
[SPEAKER_02]: on-site a bunch of art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mothership's doing the GZ1 drop,
which is the hash rules, everything around
[SPEAKER_02]: me dropped with GZ1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making me want to come,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should be there with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely be there with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why you wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the greatest surprise ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a, we have a seed breeders
lounge that's outside with the two booths
[SPEAKER_02]: with this, all this four seed breeders in
them and their hash seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to make sure we had that
component there while people are there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can mosey up and talk about what's
happening next year, what's there this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite things is that if you
have makers from all over the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: those guys are able to get together and
talk more about swapping genetics and
[SPEAKER_02]: doing things that can help push the hash,
you know, culture in each area that they
[SPEAKER_02]: live in and where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, also over great food and,
you know, good company and just amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really like Marcus said earlier,
we had to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did this interview the other day and it
was like, yeah, we, you know, legends of
[SPEAKER_02]: hash cares more about the color of your
hash than the color of your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, it's just a straight
up like, none of that stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it should be in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a part of like dividing anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really about bringing everybody
together and saying like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: we, we really don't care about anything
other than like, are you, is it a good
[SPEAKER_02]: person that loves hash that can,
you know, you know, wants to dab and wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to enjoy the space and wants to enjoy
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, there's going to be
vegans in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's vegetarians in the room and
there's meat eaters in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, sativa lovers and
indica lovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there may be a guy firing
up some BHL.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like everyone's welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one thing we did do this year is
we're making large signs and any tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke or flower smoke is to be done
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for that is so we can preserve
that indoor space that we have where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: all going to be dabbing anyway already,
which has ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't want to bring home with us
that sort of, you know, extra,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, carbon and other components when
we're judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the room, it's, I think it's a lot
better to not have that in the room if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go outside, parts per billion
breaks it up and you can probably not have
[SPEAKER_02]: an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're inside and inside space,
we think it's, you know, gives a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: to your palate and a lot more to what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be a lot of glass there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's another big part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big push last year was for glass and
breeders and farmers this year that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: adding and pushing a little harder with
the glass side and, and Scott Debbie
[SPEAKER_02]: motherships are the largest sponsor and
they're coming in and kind of bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the glass industry in with us this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've invited some special guests
that will be there with us both days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of, you know, we feel like
it's the right room of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty chadless to say the least that
it'll be a Chad free, Chad free zone for
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole place for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that in joking way too,
but it's definitely like, they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, the, the somebody
who's not into the culture and not a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of this is really just not going to enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already done a hard,
you know, we've already made a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, made certain that like the list
is, is a select amount of people that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't have there in different,
you know, in different levels too,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the second day we, we love that
because now if we're not able to bring a
[SPEAKER_02]: maker in and put them on that list,
which is really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only 40 makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have the opportunity to invite them
at least to come to the brunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get to see what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can still share their hash and see
everybody and be a part of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, that makes a big
difference for, for helping us make a
[SPEAKER_02]: decision for next year on who's on the
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a marshmallow?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we could select who's on that
list for next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then just get to know the
makers a little more depending on who they
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm most excited about, you know,
if you're an East coast ticket holder and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting to come out from the East
coast and come, come into California,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is great weather in December and
just kind of extend the good weather and
[SPEAKER_02]: the good vibes and get a good time in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're enjoying that event and,
you know, going there, you're getting to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in the room with, with, you know,
60 entries from these 40 makers that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would never see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can easily identify who the makers are
by the jars and go up and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love this, you know, I love your
product that, you know, like to shake your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted them to be able to get those
flowers in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't feel like by putting their name
on the bottom of the jar, that it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to affect the group of 40 makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be impressed with the
name of another maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the fact that they're going
to, if they're going to vote, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we, we, that's another conversation too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they, you know, we're still
figuring that part out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may make it so that they can't vote for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have to vote for the other
makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty easily done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that control in the voting so
that it is, you know, like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want your opinion on this, not to vote
for yourself, technically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if people like,
or don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that it makes it more fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it so that every vote is being
counted technically at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you vote for yourself, it's just sort
of, it's accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know you're going to vote for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already here with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you voted for yourself as soon as you
walk through the door, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: now let's let the judging, you know,
let's, you know, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really judging.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're just like, Hey, I'm just going
to vote for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you know, my stuff, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's, you want to keep it as an
art event where everyone tries everything
[SPEAKER_14]: and appreciates each other.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, that's what we're trying to
promote more of too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to know what of the other makers
stuff that was entered that you like the
[SPEAKER_02]: most.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to know whether you like
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most because we hope that you're
putting your best foot forward and you
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking love what you've presented and
that's already expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and, and it's, it's a great
way to really be able to, um, to get an
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding by, by letting only the
makers be the judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it eliminates anything either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if every person there was a judge,
every attendee and they got to see which,
[SPEAKER_02]: which name was on there, then it's a
popularity contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not what we're having.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's not a contest at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more of, you know, competition
between makers to be able to, in their
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion, what they think is the best,
you know, stuff this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have a lot of makers that are,
you know, from last year's list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have, you know,
a number of makers that are new for this
[SPEAKER_02]: year that we haven't, that we've never had
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's, you know, it's, uh,
it's definitely going to be as fair as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, as transparent as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, even afterwards,
people will be able to look and see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what was judged and how it won.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, and I think that stuff's great to
document and have so that you can see it
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of check out what was hot that
year, you know, how many, how many things
[SPEAKER_02]: are belt stuff or, you know, or this or
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, it's already,
it gets really exciting at this time of
[SPEAKER_02]: year, my taste for hash kind of dips,
because I think my, my brain knows that
[SPEAKER_02]: all this crazy hash is about to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started to get, I'm like,
all right, I'm just getting high now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and started going through
the motions because it's, it's quite
[SPEAKER_02]: overwhelming when you start seeing what's
coming in, what's culturally relevant,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's kind of brand new that just came in
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be getting pushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so that's kind of like the most
exciting part for me is to kind of see
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I admire that about you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also very much at a deep level,
understand what you're going through.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the, the, the stress and everything
is absolutely, you know, you have to
[SPEAKER_08]: balance life, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: As, uh, Johnny V was talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have passion and flow everything
you have in terms of your commitment,
[SPEAKER_08]: your will, your, your vision, what you
want to create, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: What change you want to have and make in
the future so that, um, it's not about
[SPEAKER_08]: you, but it's about the legend,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the long term impact of your work,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I need to get away and get to you and
do this, um, experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and, and, uh, and the reason why I
bring it up is because, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm running a cannabis sommelier,
um, collector's cup, which is all about
[SPEAKER_08]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: So legends is hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is about, and I know in terms of,
um, respecting time from everybody,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, I'd love to just talk about it,
uh, another time if you want to,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like get on with your day,
but I'm, I'm also here for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing I got to say is I just came
up with the, the marshmallow ashtray.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it is so cool because I didn't
have an ashtray and I have kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, smoking joint, even when you put
the joint on the marshmallow, it kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: toasts it and it comes and releases the
sweet aroma.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you open it because it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you put the joint inside and then
you close it up and then all the,
[SPEAKER_08]: all the moisture, uh, sorry, hopefully
everything gets sucked.
[SPEAKER_08]: No smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just eat it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can eat this end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can eat the butt end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, you can get high off of
it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, that's not for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't smoke with the filter either.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I think that's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, man, uh, and what one thing I asked
from any of you is the next time you smoke
[SPEAKER_08]: flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't smoke flour, I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had the ability to not smoke flour,
then, um, um, you know, I would be smoking
[SPEAKER_08]: like full melt all day, any day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, go to my website, which I'll send
a Lincoln and grade a flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm trying to get your input for a
particular flower and how you grade it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, if we find alignment because
calibration is so important.
[SPEAKER_08]: The experience that you have, when I,
when I first experienced what a quad
[SPEAKER_08]: flower was, I was like, Whoa, my life has
changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then onto the next quad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: That what I thought was a quad is really a
trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so your journey really begins that
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would definitely respect all of the,
the legends and the people that have done
[SPEAKER_08]: all that work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause the only way to do it is the
experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no shortcut to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so that just brings it up to what I
wanted to say, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for sharing Julie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that it has been a good long
hash church.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone, we're going for three hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And although I really want to continue the
conversation, um, I also want to go
[SPEAKER_07]: celebrate my wife's birthday, um,
which is today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, we've been together for like 32
years, 27 years married, uh, in a week
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to take her for a nice veggie
sandwich down in the city, but I will
[SPEAKER_07]: invite all of you back next Sunday.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sure it is for you, but if you guys
can make it, we can talk about all of
[SPEAKER_07]: these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot more to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Mark Lewis from napro apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, said he'd be a lot less busy after MJ
biz.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to get him into the
conversation with you, Nick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that would be explosive and
incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do appreciate everyone for coming on
and sharing, uh, with us here on hash
[SPEAKER_07]: church.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a deep respect for all of you for
certain and the people I'll be honest,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, this conversation today and
having hash church, for like maybe the
[SPEAKER_07]: third week in a row, we had 353 people
watching at once today and we haven't
[SPEAKER_07]: broken 300 in quite some time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, as long as I'm not frozen,
am I, I can't see anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see anyone's camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So usually I can tell by that my
internet's a little off, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I will post it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone that wants any information shared,
I'll post it in the hash church.
[SPEAKER_07]: Group on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if you also have something that you
want shared and you're not on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can put it in the description of this
video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just send me a private message,
whether it's, you know, Julie's
[SPEAKER_07]: collector's cup or the hash legends of
hash events, or anything that anyone's
[SPEAKER_07]: working on or wants to be shared with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put the napro article in the
description that I talked about the two
[SPEAKER_07]: limonene.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, we'll get back into this next
week, I hope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe if you guys can think even on
the panel, anyone that would appreciate
[SPEAKER_07]: being in this conversation that could
really bring something to that next level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's not that I don't want to be
inclusive, but there's really like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys are all special in your own,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And your passion and your knowledge and
everything that you're doing is really
[SPEAKER_07]: what makes hash church special.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had built something so special with
hash church, maybe three or four years ago
[SPEAKER_07]: that I want to bring it back to that and
understand that this conversation that
[SPEAKER_07]: happens, these conversations that happen
are shaping the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the community that we live in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so we do owe it to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a little bit of a responsibility
to continue with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: May the full now bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, porch plants, no slouch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later guys.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
Okay.
