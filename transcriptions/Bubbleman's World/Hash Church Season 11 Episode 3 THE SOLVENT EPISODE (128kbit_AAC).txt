[SPEAKER_17]: innovation and community connection.
[SPEAKER_17]: Which is what we do here at Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's elevate the craft together.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to our four sponsors.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we got so many people in the
room right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's time to get the show started.
[SPEAKER_17]: Boom, there's Ryan Hubbell, Max Eisler,
Eric Ward, Adam Temple, Hemp Guy,
[SPEAKER_17]: Waxplug, Murphy Murray.
[SPEAKER_17]: And wow, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you for taking the time to
showing up on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I get that Hash Church
especially because it's so connected to me
[SPEAKER_17]: has always been very much I think a lot of
people just assume it's really like a
[SPEAKER_17]: solventless show and that we're all about
solventless this and solventless that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, I've been guilty over the years
for being a biased prick towards
[SPEAKER_17]: solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I love that you guys have been pushing
the boundaries and really expanding what
[SPEAKER_17]: can and can't be done with the use of
solvent extractions.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank my co-host,
Dr. Mark Sheldone, who's not actually here
[SPEAKER_17]: yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure he's coming, Mark, for curating
this show and for bringing you all
[SPEAKER_17]: together.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mark's been a part of Hash Church almost
since day one.
[SPEAKER_17]: We love his knowledge of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_17]: We love the depth of conversation that
Mark brings to the table on the constant
[SPEAKER_17]: regular.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's an absolutely brilliant chemist.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact that he likes to trip balls
and watch the Grateful Dead and fish.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's just kind of a little bonus
that that I have.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have in common with the good old Mark
Sheldone.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think he just popped into the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you there, Mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_17]: There he is, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: The future's so bright, he's got to wear
shades.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sorry we're a little late.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, don't be sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're trying to get it projected
here on the big screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's everyone doing today?
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Max and Telly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you, Murphy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see who else we got in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eric, it's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_18]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.
[SPEAKER_18]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got Skunkman Sam in the room as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did invite, of course, Skunkman Sam and
I also invited Wade Lafter.
[SPEAKER_17]: These are two of our elders in the
community.
[SPEAKER_17]: They may not be connected exactly to the
level of solvent extraction that a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: you guys are, but I thought, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_17]: I still wanted them in the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sam always just has the most incredible
perspective and he's certainly,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, probably going to tell us a
bunch of stuff about solvent extraction
[SPEAKER_17]: that I didn't even know that he was
involved in because I've never mentioned
[SPEAKER_17]: anything that Sam wasn't involved in since
the actual beginning.
[SPEAKER_17]: So welcome to you, Mr. Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_17]: That is definitely when I hear howdy,
howdy, I think Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to let a few more folks into
the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: I see Jorge is there from the wax plug
from Chemtech.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Jorge.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Adam.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Max and Eric and Ryan and Murphy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the gentleman that just came in,
M.
[SPEAKER_17]: Liga.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Marshall.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Marshall.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, that's right.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I've never had a show where so
many people were able to come in and then
[SPEAKER_17]: more people and then more people.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you guys saw the emails.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm just going to add one more.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just one more.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we've got a couple more people that
are going to come in.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have about 25 people that are
going to come in here today.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not sure how Mark wants to start
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would love to get some introductions
from some of you guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm familiar with with some of
your guys' work.
[SPEAKER_17]: I obviously know Murphy Murray and I know
Adam Temple and some some of you others.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what do you think, Mark, while you guys
are getting yourself organized over there?
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think we should maybe go through a
short little introduction of everyone
[SPEAKER_17]: that's on the panel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't telephone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so we do a quick intro and we can
introduce everyone that's here first.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm Mark Sheldone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys see me?
[SPEAKER_17]: We can see you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can see you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can hear you, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can almost taste and feel you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, trust me, you're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so to my right here, we have Traynor.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all remember Traynor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Traynor is one of the best hash makers
here in the state of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got the one and only Kind Bill.
[SPEAKER_17]: The Kindest of Bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll see if you can cut the lights
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But why don't we start.
[SPEAKER_06]: So immediately to my right, I have Eric
Ward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eric, do you want to introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm Eric Ward.
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I would be known for starting the
liquid THCA separation from back in the
[SPEAKER_18]: day.
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to call it the Heisenberg.
[SPEAKER_18]: So kind of called myself the Heisenberg
there for a second.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we started cleaning.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, then we started calling it Holy
Water.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were doing the Heisenberg thing on fish
tour and kind of just selling carts like
[SPEAKER_18]: the coil carts before they were actually
carts.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then kind of got known by that and a
little before that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, yeah, Holy Water, which was the
first liquid that we brought out to High
[SPEAKER_18]: Times Cup in Denver, that first legal one
in 420.
[SPEAKER_18]: And kind of had to have to have to talk to
their lawyers to get them to change the
[SPEAKER_18]: packaging for the contest and everything,
because no one had ever seen like a thin
[SPEAKER_18]: liquid like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's kind of where I started.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm up in Washington now at a company
called Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_18]: We do brands called FullSpec, and we do
rosin and solvent with stuff called
[SPEAKER_18]: SolarRare.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have a lot of different lines out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Leafworks would be another brand.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of where I'm at these days.
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's do some consulting and lab
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of R&D.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm working with a lot of new stuff,
working with the resonator guys and doing
[SPEAKER_18]: Keefe runs of BHO.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to TJ.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, shout out to TJ.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm kind of improving the methods
of that and have done quite an extensive R
[SPEAKER_18]: &D thing with that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm doing we have a machine that does
solventless turps.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're actually able to get turps with
no steam distillation or no anything like
[SPEAKER_18]: that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we just are able to do solventless
turps.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm doing R&D with that right now,
which has been pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I love I love that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Listen, I always thought the solventless
term was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_17]: And shout out to Nicky T for coming up
with it because it was so necessary and
[SPEAKER_17]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_17]: But solventless turps.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got to be the most awesome like
solventless hydrocarbons, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Solventless hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's a method thing where it's like
we're not using solvents to extract.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I know exactly what you mean,
dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just using water, which is a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Listen, I went into that argument a few
times in my career there for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Adam Temple, next up, would you like to
introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_17]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: I met Adam, actually.
[SPEAKER_17]: We did a couple of panels together over
the years at different events.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's local to me as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: So give it up there, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Bobelman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so also from the Vancouver area,
founded Evolved Extraction Solutions back
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now kind of the largest extraction
equipment and supplies distributor in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: More recently, though, we launched the
first THCA crystallization commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: system called the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been doing a controlled crystallization
course actually at our genome technology
[SPEAKER_04]: center.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to Murphy Murray, who actually
instructs that course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super awesome way to learn about how to
isolate THC at different kind of scales.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that kind of sums it up.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get into that later for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe head over to Murphy Murray,
as you just mentioned her.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very fitting to come back to
Beyond Hash Church the day that TikTok
[SPEAKER_00]: gets turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fun day for us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking it back old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solventless folks haven't ever been able
to post on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our drugs look exactly like drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been affected the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been in this industry so long
that I stopped dropping the years because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was starting to make me sound old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out doing solventless with
nicotine, with Miele's little washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quickly, I basically have just been
trying to do whatever is new as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: it's new the whole time I've been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately for me, it hasn't gotten
boring yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked on the equipment side the
most, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked with a lot of different
equipment manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as a consultant and an educator,
my focus has always really been on like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we make this job easier for
ourselves, even with solventless?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with a washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that people out there love
their wooden spoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also just love spending my time
consuming these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why so many of us were
available today, because solvent-based
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction is way faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have more free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can hang out and consume with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing education, building
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my consulting is more of lab advisory
roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of consultant for cool
clients from time to time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I teach, because it opens
up the greatest opportunity.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we're happy to have you here for
sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I got to tell you, Dr. Mark,
you guys, although it's not exact,
[SPEAKER_17]: you guys kind of had a little bit of a
Horatio energy going on when you had the
[SPEAKER_17]: backlight lit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And quite a few people in chat even put up
the RIP to Horatio.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I felt like we got a little visit from
our good friend Horatio Delbert,
[SPEAKER_17]: who of course passed away a few years ago
and was an absolute pioneer in both
[SPEAKER_17]: solvent and solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it wasn't for Horatio, we wouldn't know
each other, Marcus, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I owe him a whole debt of
gratitude for bringing me on the Hash
[SPEAKER_06]: Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted me to set Tony straight.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to hear from Ryan Hubbell,
who's also in the room rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you doing, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for having me, Mark and Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Ryan Hubbell.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been making hash at a professional
level since 2012, moved out to California,
[SPEAKER_13]: helped start a couple brands out there,
Elephant Extracts and Sweet Leaf
[SPEAKER_13]: Extractors.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in end of 2013, beginning of
2014, I ended up at Incredibles,
[SPEAKER_13]: the edible and extracts company.
[SPEAKER_13]: And me, along with my colleague,
Max, we helped develop their solvent
[SPEAKER_13]: extraction systems, their butane system,
and led the lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in the last couple of years,
I've been a free agent and just been doing
[SPEAKER_13]: a little bit of consulting here and there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So back in 2012, you were like three years
old when you started?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm an old mother.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, damn, this guy is looking
good.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like young.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's 2012.
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, that's like some pioneer years right
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good to have you, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been told that a few times,
but when I gray out the beard and people
[SPEAKER_17]: are like, ah, you don't look that young,
actually.
[SPEAKER_17]: Marshall, would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the director of R&D at VUCA Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in a hemp farm and processing
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have CO2 and ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I'm not deep into the industry
like you folks are, I've never even been
[SPEAKER_02]: to an MJBizCon at this point, but I did go
to Humboldt State for undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of seen a lot of the industry over
the years, you know, in different areas
[SPEAKER_02]: and from different sides, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also worked in hops prior to coming
on here at VUCA Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much everybody I work with has
worked in hops and hop extracts,
[SPEAKER_02]: product development, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all kind of new to hemp and
cannabis in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I don't know much about
hydrocarbon extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a PhD, and so a lot of what I
learned is from literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a lot of data out there on
butane and propane, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just excited to be here with you
guys and learn from you guys today,
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you're dialed in, my friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got the people here who are on the
cutting edge of this.
[SPEAKER_17]: You came to me via Nick Ziegler.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nick Ziegler is one of the most
intelligent friends I have.
[SPEAKER_17]: I absolutely love and adore Nick when he
comes on Hash Church and shares his
[SPEAKER_17]: knowledge is so deep and vast.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when he hit me up and said,
you got to have my friend Marshall on,
[SPEAKER_17]: he's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, Jesus Christ, if Nick's
telling me this guy's brilliant,
[SPEAKER_17]: then I'm looking forward to having him on
the show.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you came with the highest of regards
from Nick, and we're happy to have you on
[SPEAKER_17]: here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully you can share some knowledge
and you can learn some knowledge as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've been using CO2 extraction
for what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost 10 years now built my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm building more equipment right now,
some proprietary equipment for for CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_17]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I do.
[SPEAKER_17]: I do know Nick.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nick mentioned you as well for the
aromatic volatile show that we've been
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, Nick was also involved in that
at Yakima Chief Hops when you I don't know
[SPEAKER_17]: if you worked at Yakima with him or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, no, according to them,
I came from the dark side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm the company that worked at Hoss,
which is the other larger competitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my boss is the former CEO of Yakima
Chief currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hired me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with a bunch of folks from
Yakima Chief.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did meet Nick through the hop
industry and then through this job at
[SPEAKER_02]: VUCA.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to give the panel a little bit of
background, if you don't know Nick,
[SPEAKER_17]: he was the sort of one of the main
extractors for Yakima Chief.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't even remember the numbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was absolutely astonishing.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like 4000 kilos an hour or something
that he was processing through the this
[SPEAKER_17]: giant machine that they had created.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the thing that really piqued my
interest was that he had some colleagues
[SPEAKER_17]: that designed some analytical equipment
where they could perceive to the
[SPEAKER_17]: trillionth instead of the billionth like
the proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to get these guys on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Marshall, you'll be invited to that show.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone who feels they have a specialty in
aromatic compounds, you'll be invited to
[SPEAKER_17]: that show.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to get Jeremy Plum on there.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to get Nick Ziegler.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have Marshall come on.
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we're really waiting for is his
two colleagues who put that equipment
[SPEAKER_17]: together because Nick is not willing to
speak on their work instead of having them
[SPEAKER_17]: speak on their work.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll look forward to that show kind of
in the near future.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll head on over to Jar.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yari.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yari.
[SPEAKER_17]: How you doing, Yari?
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I kind of thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Jar.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yari.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever works.
[SPEAKER_17]: A Yari of hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you as well, my friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: So please give us a little introduction.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let us know where you're at and what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've been growing for close to like 17
years now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got I got I've been doing it in Colorado
since kind of like the first legalization.
[SPEAKER_19]: We all had like the Med cards and all
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then once the extraction hit the
scene, I was just interested in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the first system that I heard about
was the ETS machine.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I actually went down and met Murphy at
the ETS place, but I couldn't get any
[SPEAKER_19]: clean runs because of those care savers.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was leaching oil into every one of my
runs that I did.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Murphy helped me as much as she
possibly could.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it just we just couldn't make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_19]: So she was the one who actually suggested
that I go over and meet the guys at
[SPEAKER_19]: Incredibles, which is where I met Max and
Telly and AK.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I met Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's kind of like the background of
how I got going in the scene.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I use their system for years.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_19]: But then I needed to upgrade a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I started kind of piecing together and
building my own system.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's that's where I met with my
background and extraction.
[SPEAKER_17]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, appreciate you sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got well, let's go over to Max.
[SPEAKER_17]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome, Max.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, can you hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I made the mistake of speaking right
while you spoke and I cut you up.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I won't do that again, I promise.
[SPEAKER_12]: No worries at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cool to see some old faces.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool to see some new faces.
[SPEAKER_12]: What up, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for putting this on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess quick little origin story is
I've been in legal cannabis since about
[SPEAKER_12]: like 2008, give or take.
[SPEAKER_12]: So going on two decades now at this point,
kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it started out just wanting good weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I was never much of a hustler.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to like secure the chronic
for myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when I was younger and I bought
a bag from my dealer and he had better
[SPEAKER_12]: weed in his sack than what he sold me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the day I realized I was
like, oh, I like need control over my
[SPEAKER_12]: supply.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it started like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it started just making some hash
for fun in my backyard with some trim,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, open blasting.
[SPEAKER_12]: At one point, Derek Cummings and I got
linked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many people know him in the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not everyone does, but what's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we started making ice hash
with just the Home Depot washing machine
[SPEAKER_12]: that had a metal drum.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we tried to do what we could
with what we had at the time, at least no
[SPEAKER_12]: plastic in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it just started with big,
you know, big large ice hash runs where we
[SPEAKER_12]: had a pulley system on bolt bags,
pulling bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then just, you know, I've got a
scientific specifically inclined mind and
[SPEAKER_12]: wanted to play with solvents and wanted to
make the elusive shatter at the time,
[SPEAKER_12]: something that was holdable and not
sticky.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, things come full circle
when we realize that shatter is not.
[SPEAKER_12]: It used to be if it doesn't shatter,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold it from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: All these little things that we used to
have.
[SPEAKER_12]: But so then that continued to evolve and
became, you know, solvent extraction
[SPEAKER_12]: became a real industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we were already kind of playing
around in our backyard, honing in
[SPEAKER_12]: something unbeknownst that there was going
to be high demand for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that medically correct Incredibles,
Derek and I linked up Telly, Ryan Hubbell
[SPEAKER_12]: came on board at some point and we know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't forget Dickie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dickie, we got we got Dickie who's not
in the scene, but he's a behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_12]: dude who was a crucial component in
machine fabrication.
[SPEAKER_12]: We ended up designing our own extraction
machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: What Ryan did not advertise for ourselves
is that we're inventors on record for a
[SPEAKER_12]: patent on that piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we never really came out to to,
you know, do anything related to metal.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were just hash makers and we saw the
end goal we wanted and we saw that none of
[SPEAKER_12]: the equipment that was available at the
time was able to, you know, deliver what
[SPEAKER_12]: we were looking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: We knew some basic things like,
you know, solvent exposure time and
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature and all these components that
we wanted more control over.
[SPEAKER_12]: And no one had access.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would give people feedback who were
designing machines.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if it was ego or if it
was too much work for them to change it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we were given boots on the ground
feedback as users on how they could
[SPEAKER_12]: improve their tech.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it just became easier to design
our own.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if it was in 2017.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know when we got our patent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Telly, do you know actually the year we
got that?
[SPEAKER_12]: You're muted right now, by the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was awarded in 2019,
but all the all the work was done in 2014.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was something we were working on
for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then those of us who are in Colorado
know that the industry, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_12]: everywhere has been kind of tumultuous.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, the race to the bottom
has happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: And at one point I was overseeing three
cultivation facilities as well as the
[SPEAKER_12]: laboratory that Ryan was managing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had about, I don't know,
maybe twenty thousand square feet of grow
[SPEAKER_12]: space.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was, you know, it was, you know,
more than a small thing, but they get
[SPEAKER_12]: bigger in between then and now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We ended up relinquishing our cultivation
licenses because everything was just
[SPEAKER_12]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, there's internal drama we
had with the fire department.
[SPEAKER_12]: One reason or another, we just had some
friction.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my role has changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're not doing a ton of extraction
anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still at Medically Correct,
doing R&D and recipe formulation,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, working out some nano,
some nanotech and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for the most part, that's kind of the
the elevator pitch of about 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_12]: to now.
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I was just thinking about while
we were sitting here is Murphy,
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember if it was you or not.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when I first came on, had left Pink
House, which was a real fun gig,
[SPEAKER_12]: we all were doing a good thing there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was and being operated very
professionally.
[SPEAKER_12]: So things kind of disintegrated there.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I first came over to Medically
Correct, we were using kind of a
[SPEAKER_12]: hybridized OB dose, maybe partial ETS
thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I needed to swing by and get a care
saver replaced.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it was you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was a bunch of little aloe vera
plants that were at the office.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had been given one and ended up
turning that one aloe vera plant until
[SPEAKER_12]: like this psychotic obsession of
propagation and turn it into thousands,
[SPEAKER_12]: if not multi-thousands of plants,
all under just some little grow lights in
[SPEAKER_12]: our machine shop warehouse, to the point
where it got excessive.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, I can't transplant these
things anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to start giving them away.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that same cutting of aloe vera is
still rocking probably a decade later and
[SPEAKER_12]: has made thousands and thousands of aloes
that have gone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at five propagations of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it up on my windowsill and the big
one down here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need aloe vera in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I attribute that aloe army that I built to
you and the first one that I got when I
[SPEAKER_12]: was picking up a refurb care saver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the aloe going and stop using
oiled compressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really good position for us
all to be in, finally.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, thanks, Max.
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate the breakdown.
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't tell if it was a real fish tank
or if it was some digital screen that you
[SPEAKER_17]: have, but that's a real fish tank.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a 75.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hell, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you, anyone that loves weed
and getting stoned and staring at a fish
[SPEAKER_17]: tank, it's got to still be one of my
favorite things to do 25 years later.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you like growing weed, there's so many
parallels because you got to make sure the
[SPEAKER_12]: water level is right, look at everyone,
make sure they're healthy, they're
[SPEAKER_12]: talking.
[SPEAKER_17]: Listen, at one point in time, years ago,
it was got to be close to 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember I went over to Breeder Steve's
place and he had started this what he was
[SPEAKER_17]: calling guppy ponics and he had these
Egyptian mouth breeder fish and there was
[SPEAKER_17]: this whole cycle of the fish pooped and
then the worms ate their poop and then
[SPEAKER_17]: they pooped and that poop fed the plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: This herb was so fucking like,
I can't even explain it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like herbs.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an herb that felt like it was
flushed like a thousand X from any herb
[SPEAKER_17]: that I'd ever seen before.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just more Breeder Steve stuff and
then he got a kick out of feeding the fish
[SPEAKER_17]: like his hamburger to bug out the
vegetarian and the vegans.
[SPEAKER_17]: He'd be like, oh, I'll just feed them a
little bit of hamburger.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, hamburger fed sweet skunk guppy
ponics for the win.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shout out to Breeder Steve, you fucking
maniac.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said I would love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds bank.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely something.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely something.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to shout out Jorge, who's in the
room.
[SPEAKER_17]: He hasn't turned on his camera yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if we're getting Jorge's
call.
[SPEAKER_17]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's up, homie?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going good, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going good.
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to give a little introduction to
the crew?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure many know you and some may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Jorge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't roll the R, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say George.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better known as Waxplug in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started back in 2016, open blasting
straight up, just glass tube in the
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard like everyone else, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started doing my research there in
the background until I developed or found
[SPEAKER_01]: a way to bleach the oil, which became
what's known now as CRC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my introduction into the main industry
was around 2018 when I introduced or
[SPEAKER_01]: shared some of the techniques I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I was able to gain more
opportunities, eventually opened up
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemtech, which is a company which
distributes equipment and centrifuges,
[SPEAKER_01]: stainless steel components, just about
everything, really consumables.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from there, I was able to then really
focus on research and trying out stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to really connect with a lot
of labs and eventually ended up forming
[SPEAKER_01]: Waxplug Academy, which is now an
educational platform where we help others
[SPEAKER_01]: learn through there and also through a
university in Argentina right now in
[SPEAKER_01]: Buenos Aires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two platforms right now going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, having all these tools at
your disposal has really just helped push
[SPEAKER_01]: everything forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I travel the world a lot currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been to a lot of countries and
helped push the techniques over there
[SPEAKER_01]: forward, get the knowledge going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just prevent some of the pitfalls that
we saw in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been mainly just focusing on
crystallization lately and developing
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are like the main focuses right now
I've seen in the industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I met Jorge and yes, I can roll my
R's because je suis français.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I absolutely know how to roll my R.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just didn't, I was like, I didn't want
to sound like I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_17]: or whatnot, but I'll call you Jorge from
now on, my friend.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, we met in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Jeez, it had to be a year or two ago now
through Alex Rogers ICBC, the
[SPEAKER_17]: International Cannabis Business
Conference.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Jorge was just, he was just rocking
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_17]: This guy was walking around with big old
diamonds and just giving diamonds away to
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it really created a neat, I saw it
create a really neat like excitement.
[SPEAKER_17]: Similar to the excitement I've seen when I
roll around and give out people full melt
[SPEAKER_17]: hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And your diamonds were impressive.
[SPEAKER_17]: You gave me a couple and they were,
they were, they were eight to 10 carat
[SPEAKER_17]: diamonds for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like they were not the little baby one
carats.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also dug your little, your little
grabber that you had, your little custom
[SPEAKER_17]: chemtech triple prong grabbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the depth to it just keeps sliding
off.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: So good looking out, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to thank, you know, thank you guys
for being a sponsor today as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: So really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I have, let me just make sure,
go into gallery.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think everyone has mentioned we've sort
of gotten a little introduction from
[SPEAKER_17]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am going to bring, I said earlier in
the chat, I would, you know, lost,
[SPEAKER_17]: lost a lot of friends in the last year.
[SPEAKER_17]: We lost a lot of good people.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not even going to try and shout them
all out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it was just so many and I hate the
idea of forgetting one, but there is one
[SPEAKER_17]: that I want to bring back from the grave
to show up on our show today because this
[SPEAKER_17]: guy has been, he's been a pioneer in this
solvent extraction for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just sent him the link.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see if he's going to make it in.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm kind of excited actually to bring this
guy back.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, here he is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Without further ado, I'm bringing someone
back to life today.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're bringing Indra back.
[SPEAKER_17]: Indra was not dead, as many have been
saying, including myself for the last like
[SPEAKER_17]: six months to a year.
[SPEAKER_17]: He wrote me the other day and he said,
stop telling people I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this really you?
[SPEAKER_17]: I was all shaken.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was freaking out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, I was like, what the what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_17]: How could I've never in my life been a
part of a rumor of a good friend of mine
[SPEAKER_17]: being dead that wasn't dead.
[SPEAKER_17]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_17]: John Davis, Indra in the flesh,
old as fuck, but we're happy to have you
[SPEAKER_17]: here, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: So happy to have you here.
[SPEAKER_17]: How have you been, dude?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, eight seventy nine start slowing
your ass way down, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got diabetes and blood pressure,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still alive and I have no plans for
dying.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, it's it's really good to hear your
voice.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's good to hear your voice, Indra.
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're you're a big part of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been a big part since day one.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, you're a wild maniac of a
person.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's part of the reason that I love you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And and appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've always sort of tried to maintain
a good friendship with you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how we had a little falling
out, but I'm really glad that you're
[SPEAKER_17]: alive.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm really glad that you're here for the
solvent episode.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, for those of you that don't know,
Indra really was, you know, kind of the
[SPEAKER_17]: grandfather of B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_17]: He released that process and back in
nineteen ninety nine on Eeroid dot org and
[SPEAKER_17]: really kind of got the ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, he was also one of the first
people that, you know, when things were
[SPEAKER_17]: going a little bit the wrong way with
ethyl mercapitines and sort of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, open blasting and young people
blowing up, he was immediately completely
[SPEAKER_17]: conscious of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he reached out to me of all people,
which kind of fed into my bias of B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_17]: because, you know, he hit me up and he'd
be like, look, you got to warn people
[SPEAKER_17]: about these mercapitines that are in the
oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not good.
[SPEAKER_17]: They concentrate.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to you got to warn people that
they can't be doing open blasting.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that plugs spark inside the plug.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't be like out on your deck,
like with your bikini top, like blasting B
[SPEAKER_17]: .H.O.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so he was really, although he was the
guy that released this process,
[SPEAKER_17]: he was also very conscious and like I
could tell that it was hurting his soul a
[SPEAKER_17]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something that he had released that
he really just meant for it to be such a
[SPEAKER_17]: good thing, had been taken in a way,
sort of spread in a way that was a little
[SPEAKER_17]: bit disconcerting.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I got to give props to all of you
on the panel because really what you guys
[SPEAKER_17]: are, are the people who are pioneering
this solvent extraction far away from,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, I mean, we can laugh about it
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Jorge just said, oh, I was open blasting
like we all were.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, God, thank you that you're all
here, that you're all safe, that none of
[SPEAKER_17]: you have burn marks on your body for the
rest of your lives.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the right way and the wrong way to
do things.
[SPEAKER_17]: And obviously that particular process,
it really, I say it all the time and I
[SPEAKER_17]: don't mean it as a pun, but it is a pun.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, when he released that method,
it was within a month of me releasing
[SPEAKER_17]: bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really remember kind of being like,
really, like, really, dude, like,
[SPEAKER_17]: because BHO was more popular.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just, there's no, like,
I can't deny that it was more popular.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I'd love to get into this conversation
with you guys, because I know a lot of you
[SPEAKER_17]: are like Max in the sense of just trying
to get the best heady stash in your bag.
[SPEAKER_17]: You just want the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of us were just, have always been
looking for the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's nice to see, I don't want to lose
my train of thought, but it's nice to see
[SPEAKER_17]: people taking things out of this sort of
sketchy situation and bringing it into a
[SPEAKER_17]: much more, hey, maybe having a little bit
of chemistry, understanding, having a
[SPEAKER_17]: class one div one room, you know,
all of these different things that many of
[SPEAKER_17]: you guys have sort of pioneered in this
industry have been very, very important to
[SPEAKER_17]: bring to the forefront so that these
products can become made available.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was terrified back in the day,
and I know you guys laugh about it,
[SPEAKER_17]: but you guys must've been a little,
like, terrified too when it was happening,
[SPEAKER_17]: when people were just like, yeah,
Eric, give me a story.
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, you have burn marks all over me,
because this did happen to me in the
[SPEAKER_18]: beginning of 2013 in January, 2013,
because I was, Grey Wolf was putting up
[SPEAKER_18]: his turpinator up on the internet,
you know, first one of the first closed
[SPEAKER_18]: loops.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I made my own version of that,
because it was all open blasting before
[SPEAKER_18]: that.
[SPEAKER_18]: So my whole goal was to make, because I'm
very, you know, engineering inclined.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not formally educated, but I've
definitely made closed loops myself and
[SPEAKER_18]: have adapted many and done a lot of custom
stuff on that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so my very first one I made,
I started making in 2010, so I had it
[SPEAKER_18]: going for about a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I did like some custom stuff to
it, and I was doing like, I had like a dip
[SPEAKER_18]: tube in it, and I was doing like different
batches into like Teflon bags.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I would just have like a gelled
ice cube thing that I would warm up and
[SPEAKER_18]: put in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would evaporate it out like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was still keeping liquid in it so I
could use dry ice blocks to separate it
[SPEAKER_18]: later, because that's how I was doing holy
water.
[SPEAKER_18]: And after about a year and a half,
there was just a static, a static problem
[SPEAKER_18]: that definitely ignited, ignited me in the
process.
[SPEAKER_18]: But this was in the very beginning,
this was before people came out with
[SPEAKER_18]: closed loop machines.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this was very, very beginning.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you know, that was my lesson on
that was you do need a C1D1.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I was gone, I was given liquid
to Addison for a long time at Steep Hill,
[SPEAKER_18]: because that's how I met a lot of people
in the beginning was doing testing,
[SPEAKER_18]: because nobody had any information on any
of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was having to do my own testing at
that time.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I was giving stuff to him.
[SPEAKER_18]: And nobody had seen liquid or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's what I prefer to smoke.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just like terpenes.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's my main thing is really
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always been that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and so I've been giving it to him.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I just disappeared for nine
months, because I was in the hospital for
[SPEAKER_18]: a month.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I had three surgeries,
skin graft stuff, like really gnarly,
[SPEAKER_18]: almost died type stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, and then I lived with my parents
for about eight months.
[SPEAKER_18]: They had to take care of me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then after that, the whole thing,
like literally like the word dab came out
[SPEAKER_18]: in 2013.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, the industry started getting big
right around there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And people would be coming to Steep Hill
and Addison would be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_18]: that's good.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, but my friend does this thing,
makes this liquid and started telling
[SPEAKER_18]: people about me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so by the time I was healed and
feeling better, a lot of people everywhere
[SPEAKER_18]: knew who I was, or at least knew the name,
you know, holy water.
[SPEAKER_18]: And people were like looking for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like, does he exist?
[SPEAKER_18]: There were some articles written about it
is just some really interesting coming
[SPEAKER_18]: from just being in bed for eight or nine
months thinking I'm never going to be in
[SPEAKER_18]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not even really an industry yet.
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even think it was going to be
possible, but I came back and I tried to
[SPEAKER_18]: teach people and it just wasn't up to what
I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I started doing it again myself.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, then my parents says like,
they're going to kill me, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: but I believe that this was the thing that
I, this was the thing that I like to do
[SPEAKER_18]: the most.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I always had other jobs and things like
that until this started just coming out
[SPEAKER_18]: and started literally, you know,
blowing up in the right way.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that's when I went out to,
you know, I was with that company Nectars
[SPEAKER_18]: in the beginning and went out to that,
you know, high times thing in 2014 in
[SPEAKER_18]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's when we officially kind of
unveiled the whole idea of liquid and the
[SPEAKER_18]: separation thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was the very beginning of all
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, I live with those scars every
day and it is something to think about and
[SPEAKER_18]: it's something that, you know,
as I've worked in labs since and done
[SPEAKER_18]: consultations and things like that,
safety is a priority.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's one of those things that I'm so
glad to see because you don't ever want it
[SPEAKER_18]: to happen to anyone else.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I train a lot of people and it's very
important to do things the correct way and
[SPEAKER_18]: to do things safely.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I love that that's where this business
went.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause I never thought I was going to do
this for a living.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that I can't believe.
[SPEAKER_18]: I am lucky enough to have an industry
around something that was a, an illegal,
[SPEAKER_18]: dangerous hobby that I had hurt myself
and, you know, actually gotten in trouble
[SPEAKER_18]: for in California in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, so I was like the second person
that they had busted for PHO back then.
[SPEAKER_18]: So for me to do this now, you know,
is crazy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did they slap you with a manufacturing
charge?
[SPEAKER_18]: It did.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have one.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Back in, that was in 2008.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was the end of 2008.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's bad when they, when they
give you their, its own name.
[SPEAKER_17]: When they give it, let's call it
manufacturing and we'll make it even
[SPEAKER_17]: worse.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything that you're making is
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So all the people back then, since there
was no manufacturing for hash people
[SPEAKER_18]: really, you know, they thought I was like
making that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you know, they, that, that charge
is just for anything that is bad.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so for, to be able to go through all
of that and go through all the,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, house arrest slash all the
bullshit I had to go through.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was, you know, and then to burn
myself like after, you know, it's like to,
[SPEAKER_18]: to trip up a few times like that,
because it's in the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_18]: you're doing things and building things
that no one's ever done.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're doing things that you're just
like, okay, you know, is this going to
[SPEAKER_18]: work?
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are consequences to being at
things in the beginning like that,
[SPEAKER_18]: but it's also a learning thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can teach people who are younger
and just be like, this is not what you do.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_17]: The people who will stand on the shoulders
of giants, you being the next generational
[SPEAKER_17]: giants, it's, it's, that's what we mean.
[SPEAKER_17]: When we say standing on the shoulders of
giants, we are learning from their
[SPEAKER_17]: mistakes as much as we are learning from
their breakthroughs and their epiphanies.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's heavy, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's heavy.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to get into that a little bit more
in a bit, but I think as we're going
[SPEAKER_17]: through history at this episode,
it would be cool to hear from John just
[SPEAKER_17]: out of his own words, kind of like how he
discovered this process and how he
[SPEAKER_17]: released this process on a row.
[SPEAKER_17]: And once he gets done that, I do want to
talk a little bit more from, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: from Adam and Murphy, Eric, Telly,
just in regards to the education that you
[SPEAKER_17]: guys are doing now, Jorge as well,
in regards to what you guys do in order to
[SPEAKER_17]: make sure that we're inspiring people to
do this the right way now, because
[SPEAKER_17]: sometimes like, for instance, I can,
I can take complete and total,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, accountability for showing
everyone how to make water hash the wrong
[SPEAKER_17]: way.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when I first came out, I would take
the bubble, I'd roll it up all wet.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone's hash was molding.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was totally my fault.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was responsible for that for years.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, here I am trying to pioneer
and be a pioneer and do some new things.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you make this key mistake that
you wear sort of as this, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: for you, Eric, as a burn mark for me,
just as this sort of conscious,
[SPEAKER_17]: like, oh my God, like all I wanted people
to do is have better hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm probably responsible for like a
metric ton of it molding.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that weighed heavy on my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe not as heavy as a burn, but trust
me, man, it weighed heavy on my shoulders,
[SPEAKER_17]: knowing that I was the reason that
people's hash was molding.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that took a very long time to kind of
break that down and be, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: 2002 to 2007 or eight, I was absolutely
obsessed with teaching people about the
[SPEAKER_17]: desiccant.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, for me, I found pizza boxes.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a food grade cardboard.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_17]: If I, if I, if I see the hash very,
very, very thin over the cardboard,
[SPEAKER_17]: it wouldn't stick to the fibers.
[SPEAKER_17]: It would come off beautifully.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the desiccant action of the cardboard
would absorb the water, which was also
[SPEAKER_17]: being, you know, weighed down by gravity
and pulled into the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_17]: The corrugation of the cardboard would go
into one level and then it would dry,
[SPEAKER_17]: go into the next level.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it was a way for us here in the
Pacific Northwest to dry hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nickatee around 2008, I want to say,
or nine, he started coming up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, he's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's not in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's saying, I don't know what this
bubble man guy's talking about,
[SPEAKER_17]: but you don't need to put it on fucking
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that's brutal.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just put it on some parchment,
much cleaner, no fibers, this,
[SPEAKER_17]: that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Nickatee and I really taught each
other something because we were kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: banging heads.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, what the fuck is this guy
talking about?
[SPEAKER_17]: He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's over in Colorado saying the exact
same thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking bubble man does not know what he's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_17]: We learned together that yes, in Colorado,
where you need all that aloe, you don't
[SPEAKER_17]: need the desiccant action of the
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll dry from the air if you break it up
small enough.
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you try to do that in the Pacific
Northwest, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_17]: You are getting moisture trapped in your
hash and it's going to cause you problems
[SPEAKER_17]: down the line.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Indra, if you wouldn't mind giving us a
historical context of how you came to
[SPEAKER_17]: this, like what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just like sitting around one day.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just like, what, what the fuck,
please.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was in Vietnam in 1967 and trying to
get the locals to bring us some pot to
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke was nearly impossible.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would bring it, but it would be these
big, wet, heavy buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you couldn't light them with a fucking
blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you could tell that it was good
because it looked good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I started thinking about it and I
thought, well, maybe I should try a small,
[SPEAKER_08]: I had read about gaseous extraction back
in 1898.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, well, maybe this will work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I took a big pen, I shoved the barrel
out of it, crammed it with wet buds,
[SPEAKER_08]: turned it upside down, took a Ronson
butane lighter refill thing and hammered
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there on the dish in front of me and a
few other guys sitting was a red puddle
[SPEAKER_08]: bubbling.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody's like, what's that Dave?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, that might be the reason or
the answer to us getting high.
[SPEAKER_08]: So not a good thing to do, but everybody
put it on cigarettes and everybody smoked
[SPEAKER_08]: it, including myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody got hammered and they're
wondering what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, well, it's, it's oil from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in 67.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I came back to the States,
68.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was shot all the pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got shot to the middle while I was
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I came back and I was thinking about
it for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then around 1988 or 89, I ran into
this guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to Switzerland and while I was in
Switzerland, I met a guy named Hans who
[SPEAKER_08]: offered me space to work in his shop,
even though it was totally illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: He saw something else in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He saw flowers and spices and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he wanted me to be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did start that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We worked for Roberta.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the biggest perfume companies on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we worked for them for a number of
years, producing fine perfume,
[SPEAKER_08]: oils, spices, and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I started to talk to Hans about,
Hey, maybe we should try some large
[SPEAKER_08]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a 38 foot tall four inch or four
foot wide pipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we loaded that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He introduced me to some Swiss guys who
had been growing pot for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had a huge warehouse that was,
I don't know, it was 600 feet long,
[SPEAKER_08]: 200 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was filled with boxes of dried pot that
mice had come in and pissed on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these guys were like, can you do
anything about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, well, yeah, I can take the
oil out and it won't smell like mouse piss
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we moved everything over there and
started to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were filling this thing up every
other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had gallons and gallons and gallons
of this beautiful red oil that was just
[SPEAKER_08]: immaculate.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could hardly not want to have it every
day as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point in time, these guys,
I wanted to go back to the States and so I
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted them to pay me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did pay me something,
but they didn't pay me for all the work we
[SPEAKER_08]: did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, while that was all going on,
they didn't pay me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed that after we extracted,
there was a lot of trichromes available.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we wanted to try to find out how to
get the trichromes the most efficient way
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what I discovered was that if you
freeze the pot using liquid nitrogen down
[SPEAKER_08]: to extreme low levels, you crunch it all
up in a 55 gallon drum, use a four by four
[SPEAKER_08]: to smash it while it's cold and it turns
it into a powder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically that leaves you about two inches
or three inches of crushed material at the
[SPEAKER_08]: bottom of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then I pulled the material out and we
constructed a silk screen with 26 inches,
[SPEAKER_08]: 26 per inch threads.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we took the pot that we had crunched
up in this and put it in that and shook
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then only the trichromes came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the greens stayed behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason it did is because the green
took up some moisture and it wouldn't fit
[SPEAKER_08]: through the silk screen, but the
trichromes all fit through it like there
[SPEAKER_08]: was no tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we made these giant piles.
[SPEAKER_08]: of golden trichromes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have a video of Johnny shaking it
out and scraping it up on a black sheet
[SPEAKER_08]: that we used at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here we had these trichromes and we
had the oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then I thought, what will happen if we
mix the oil and the trichromes together to
[SPEAKER_08]: make extremely good hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought about it and all I did was I
poured liquid nitrogen into a stainless
[SPEAKER_08]: steel bowl, those big mixing bowls.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I poured the oil in and then the
oil started shattering immediately because
[SPEAKER_08]: of the temperature differentiation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It shattered and shattered.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I stuck a baseball bat in it,
made sure it was all finely powdered.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like, I don't know, it looked
like maybe milk or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was milky lucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: So after I got that in, then I poured it
into the trichromes in a ratio of 55 or 60
[SPEAKER_08]: to 40.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that was poured in, I stirred it
quite a bit and then just stuck the bowl
[SPEAKER_08]: outside on the porch and liquid nitrogen
drained off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could just reach in and grab a
handful of this really soft hash that was,
[SPEAKER_08]: you could roll it into a temple ball in
just a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would dry with the skin on the outside
of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every, where we were in California,
we couldn't make it fast enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, everybody wanted it no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in the day when there was
dispensaries, but they weren't really
[SPEAKER_08]: legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we would go to them and take one
suitcase full of oil in little one gram
[SPEAKER_08]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_08]: We called it golden oil because it was
golden looking.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't look red until you heated it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it turned back red.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we took in a little suitcase full of
temple balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: We never left any behind at any head shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all bought them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we took in two kilos of oil and two
kilos of hash balls, they were sold.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They paid us cash money and we were out
the door.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that was my way of making good
hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to make it as safe as possible,
liquid nitrogen, non-toxic, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, so that just led you about 10
years later.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would suggest, first of all,
for those of you that don't know who
[SPEAKER_17]: Roberti is, like this is, this is not just
a perfume company.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a company that's been around since
1850.
[SPEAKER_17]: They are like the world's leaders in
natural raw materials when it comes to
[SPEAKER_17]: fragrance and flavors and extraction and
like any scientist that works at Roberti.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone on this panel would die to speak to
this person for, for any amount of time.
[SPEAKER_17]: They really are serious, serious players.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, that's a big part of,
of, of, of John's history.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would also add that, you know,
when you hear kind of the older guys talk,
[SPEAKER_17]: oh, it was the best this and that back in
the day, you have to imagine like,
[SPEAKER_17]: imagine BHO like 20 or 30 years before
anyone had BHO.
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine what an anomaly it would be to
have someone put that in your bowl.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can tell you before I met John,
I met a guy in Amsterdam and I wish I
[SPEAKER_17]: could remember this guy's name.
[SPEAKER_17]: He was a little guy, glasses.
[SPEAKER_17]: He was an older guy and he was from
Seattle and he was a real character.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I met him in a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_17]: I met him in a coffee shop in Amsterdam
and he said he had this crazy hash oil
[SPEAKER_17]: that, you know, no one has and it's
stronger than anything in a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this would have been like 97 or 98.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was kind of like, well, whatever,
you know, I'm, I smoke pretty good,
[SPEAKER_17]: man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, oh, you know, okay, I'll try your
hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he gave me a rip of this hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now keep in mind, this is really before
anyone had tried BHO.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I actually took a small rip of it and
got very, very, very high off of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like it was something different.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't just your average product.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got so high off of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually bought a gram from the guy and,
and funny enough, and this is,
[SPEAKER_17]: it's so hard for me to even say this.
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't fucking finish it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually went to Mila's pollinator shop
on my way out of the country and I gave it
[SPEAKER_17]: to her and I swear to God, it was still
like a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyway, I find out that the guy got the
hash from my buddy, the nose and the nose
[SPEAKER_17]: nose and the nose is Steve Dumas from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone that's ever been to Amsterdam and
spent any amount of time at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: cup or, you know, touring around in that
city.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you are a hash connoisseur or
aficionado, you are going to know who the
[SPEAKER_17]: nose is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, lo and behold, the nose and John
Davis Indra are old friends, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: So he, I go over to his house and he's
like, yeah, my crazy buddy came over and
[SPEAKER_17]: he stuck all this weed in a pen and he
blasted it with a little Ronson tube.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was just like, that's how you made
that shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, what the actual fuck.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I actually got my gram off Steve.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the last gram that he had.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how much you made their John.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he said he had like 10 or 20 grams
of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just a couple of, you know,
like maybe 10 pencils or something,
[SPEAKER_17]: but it was one of the strongest products I
had ever, ever smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was the small world, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, a year or two later,
I would start doing bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_17]: Indra would release the BHO method.
[SPEAKER_17]: And eventually we would, you know,
kind of link up to together.
[SPEAKER_17]: I, my team actually went out to his
facility in Kansas and saw his like three
[SPEAKER_17]: story BHO extractor, like the biggest BHO
extractor you could possibly ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_17]: And ran some batches, not of cannabis for
cannabinoid in our aromatic compounds,
[SPEAKER_17]: but actually for something completely
different.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we did end up seeing that equipment.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mike West and a few other people from my
team went over there and worked with
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny and Indra's son.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and we saw that it was real.
[SPEAKER_17]: We saw that this thing actually existed.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'd never seen a BHO machine that was
metering the BHO in.
[SPEAKER_17]: It would meter it in and out of the
system.
[SPEAKER_17]: So he was like, we don't have to worry
about like wondering how much is.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then he would also talk about how
like, I would be like, how much did you
[SPEAKER_17]: lose over like the course of like some
years?
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, oh, maybe like a cup full.
[SPEAKER_17]: So he's like reusing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, cool story, Indra.
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the old schoolness,
1967 in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_17]: How fucking crazy is it that Skunkman Sam
discovered static tech in Africa and Indra
[SPEAKER_17]: discovered the BHO method in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just putting that together right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_17]: What country was, did you discover that in
again, Sam?
[SPEAKER_17]: It was Gambia.
[SPEAKER_17]: Gambia.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course it was, of course it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: West Africa.
[SPEAKER_09]: John, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: The material that you were using that your
boxes and boxes with mouse is on it in
[SPEAKER_09]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it Swiss Mopadope or was it ITAC only?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because all of the stuff that I saw mass
produced in Switzerland was Mopadope.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know because the Swiss guys took
care of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took care of the production and I didn't
speak Swiss German or Swiss French or
[SPEAKER_08]: Swiss anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just a listener at those things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a lot of people producing a lot of
cannabis in Switzerland when I was
[SPEAKER_09]: visiting there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But most of them were using varieties that
were half THC high varieties mixed with
[SPEAKER_09]: Swiss Mopadope.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the best, but it still got the
THC in there, but it probably had a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD, I suspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the plant that we used for all
this was a plant that these Swiss guys had
[SPEAKER_08]: gotten from the Swiss Institute of
Technology of Plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was called Queen of Happiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could take an eight inch bud and shake
off about three to five grams of
[SPEAKER_08]: trichromes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something that the Swiss Institute
invented.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then these guys were going there,
so they took full advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: What year was this, John, in Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_17]: Was this in the late 80s?
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in the late 80s when I went there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started producing stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stayed there as long as I could,
but even finally the Swiss people said,
[SPEAKER_08]: hey, no more visas for you to fuck out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did it about 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_17]: Saw much of what Sam saw as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely saw fields of decent weed as
well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Steve was growing really good weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shanti Baba was growing really good weed
down in Bellinzona, greenhouses of
[SPEAKER_17]: spectacular, proper cultivars,
proper grown.
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, some of the nicest flowers I'd
ever seen grown in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a greenhouse that Shanti Baba Scott
Blakey had.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was seven foot tall calio plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like walking into an orange
orchard.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was California orange from the seeds
originally.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so good, Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was mind bending walking into this
room.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember asking him, I was like,
whoa, dude, how did you do this?
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone else was having these problems.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not anything against the people in
our industry or growers in generally.
[SPEAKER_17]: It might be something to do with
prohibition, but I asked him his secret
[SPEAKER_17]: and he said, I don't hire smokers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, well, really, I don't hire
growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, all my growers in that
greenhouse are rose growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't hire weed growers because they
already know how to do everything better
[SPEAKER_17]: than me.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want them doing that on my
dollar.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just hire rose growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I tell them instead of bricks,
you have to be worried about resin that
[SPEAKER_17]: you can get in your eyes and then it
burns.
[SPEAKER_17]: And other than that, they just listened to
everything he said and executed exactly
[SPEAKER_17]: what he said.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was like a perfect cannabis grow
operation.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was like back in 2001 that I saw
this.
[SPEAKER_17]: If I was better organized and I had my old
hard drives plugged in, I'd bring up the
[SPEAKER_17]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to say this, Marcus, but the same
thing with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would prefer to have growers that did
not know how to grow pot already and just
[SPEAKER_09]: did what I told them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would come out better than all my
friends who have been growing for 20
[SPEAKER_09]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you guys just prefer using an
SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just like standard operating
procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you wanted employees in
some kind of work for pay scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so much has changed,
but things stay the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say back to the mouse piss
box because I felt that in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing about working with
solvents in the cannabis industry that is
[SPEAKER_00]: unfair is that the better you get at this
craft, the worse weed people want to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: you to ask you to save them from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we get a lot of
innovation out of cultivation failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else has ruined product for six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now after it's been in storage for
another six months, I've got to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's tricky about that is that we
don't really get to brag about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest parts of what we do because gross,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Laura has brought up his CRC,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was so cool to be able to pull
that pigment out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when we didn't know what the function
of having it there was, it was just cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and interesting to be able to do and talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we get this like negative
connotation and now we don't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss our science with the same
excitement because a lot of times we learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from some garbage boxes of mouse piss
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find out we could do some really
cool shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm glad you brought that up,
Murphy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a really good conversation in the
sense of, you know, I've had the
[SPEAKER_17]: conversation with media bros.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had had the conversation with a few
different people.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had the conversation with the
irradiation folks, the people that do,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, when you're failing microphones,
microbials and it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: as a business owner, there's sort of two
views of sites.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll get to you right after this,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's that, okay, you've got your sort of
Instagram, I hate to call them fuck boys,
[SPEAKER_17]: but this sort of Instagram bro science of
like, oh yeah, like you can't be doing
[SPEAKER_17]: that.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't be doing this and that's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's, they're just doing this to,
you know, polish a turd and this,
[SPEAKER_17]: that, and the other thing from a business
perspective, like running a big facility,
[SPEAKER_17]: investing a ton of money, like having
employees, having responsibilities and
[SPEAKER_17]: being accountable to a large group of
people, you know, you make 25.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I asked this question to many people
in regards to the irradiation,
[SPEAKER_17]: like I'm not looking to irradiate myself.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to not have to irradiate a single
product.
[SPEAKER_17]: If I make 25 kilos of bubble hash for a
customer, and this happened recently and
[SPEAKER_17]: it was wild because they wanted to use
their own lab for testing and the lab came
[SPEAKER_17]: back that it had failed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it needed to go to irradiation,
which is what they wanted it to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did a huge lab investigation because I
just was like, that's impossible.
[SPEAKER_17]: I swab everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've done the math.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've done the numbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I am paying attention to my variables in
my lab.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it took me three months and after
three months, I realized that,
[SPEAKER_17]: sorry, John, I'll just mute you real
quick.
[SPEAKER_17]: I realized that they had made a mistake in
the lab and that it had not failed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that was three and a half months of a
problematic experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, would you tell, if you're a brand new
company, you've invested all your money,
[SPEAKER_17]: you've mortgaged your house, you've got
your buddies working for you.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a roots thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not the suits as people like to,
you know, you're the roots.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're doing this the best that you can.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you have a fail like that,
but you're gonna be righteous for your
[SPEAKER_17]: Instagram audience.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you're gonna tell them, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_17]: I threw that 25 kilos away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Who the fuck is throwing away 25 kilos of
hash just to serve a group of people on
[SPEAKER_17]: Instagram who are never gonna buy that
hash, whether you were radiated it or not.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's this double edged sword and you
have it with CRC as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course it's great if you make a nice
product, but maybe it has a little bit of
[SPEAKER_17]: a slight look to it because consumers are
so bloody picky and they're only gonna buy
[SPEAKER_17]: something based on the color.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now what?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we see our seeded, but so it kind of
becomes are you the company that maybe a
[SPEAKER_17]: fail happened at a lab that wasn't even a
real fail and you were required to
[SPEAKER_17]: irradiate for this particular reason?
[SPEAKER_17]: Or are you the company, and this is the
part that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_17]: Murphy, why you kind of can't talk about
it, why you look bad, because there's
[SPEAKER_17]: brutal fucking companies out there that
are doing nothing but growing moldy
[SPEAKER_17]: schwag.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're happy to do it because they know
they can irradiate it at the end of the
[SPEAKER_17]: process.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it actually affects the SOPs in the
beginning and during because they know
[SPEAKER_17]: where they're going is just like it
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna CRC and we're gonna irradiate
and we're gonna get great product.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not really what those two things
were designed to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were designed to help people in
certain situations, but they become a
[SPEAKER_17]: double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_17]: You get people who move in with low
integrity and then they go about doing
[SPEAKER_17]: their business in that way.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'll pass it over to Mark.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless you had something else to say,
Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just want to add, you know,
what's tricky is we don't have a good way
[SPEAKER_00]: to evaluate and compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the CRC gets that complaint
about flavor, but I always bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: removing the flavor that was there
might've been important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor that was there might've been
gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's fantastic flour
that we can extract and get fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you get a box of mouse
piss weed, we say in exchange for no mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: piss, we're gonna have no other flavor
either, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us to, you know, be blamed for
the cut when we're a band aid is unfair
[SPEAKER_00]: because we should be able to promote,
you know, the individual components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get better at that as an industry,
but you know, it's like, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love nicotine too, but that word
solventless really took us back years in
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific conversation because we've
tried to create separation where we should
[SPEAKER_00]: have had a lot more conversation and a lot
more, you know, nuance between each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we all want the best of whatever's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one who would say throw away 25
kilos of concentrate is someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have it to throw away who didn't
pay for it to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I believe in recovery,
you know, I believe in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: reclaiming what you can, but safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a really, it's a tricky
conversation because when someone makes
[SPEAKER_00]: green bubble hash and everybody has done
it like one time, it'll happen and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you learn, but they don't have to live
with that every day and they don't try to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell that cause they can't hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so this is a conversation
that we all have together, I think within
[SPEAKER_00]: the solvent like based community,
but it doesn't really escape us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, it's unfair, I think to the
consumers as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So CRC has its place for sure,
but unfortunately over the years,
[SPEAKER_19]: it's definitely ruined BHO because for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we've been running mouse piss weed,
you know, we allowed growers to give us
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage weed cause we could fix it,
you know, that standard was not held.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, like I said, see it like,
uh, when I first made the, the rosin ship
[SPEAKER_19]: diamonds years and years ago, CRC was a
big part of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And W1 was the best thing to do that with.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, like I said, it definitely has its
place, but as far as people doing BHO with
[SPEAKER_19]: quality material, the CRC has trickled
over to everyone just thinks everything
[SPEAKER_19]: CRC so like honed in on what color it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: And people care more about the color than
the actual quality of having good hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I would like to add on that
because I saw it from day one when I
[SPEAKER_17]: released the bubble bags and started doing
the bubble hash, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: I listen, I got lucky guys like me and
Nickatee and Matt rise.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had an olfactory sense and a lucky
ability to be friends with guys like sub
[SPEAKER_17]: cool and people who are growing
spectacular, like second to none cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was our advantage.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so in the very early days,
I, you know, breeder Steve's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, you want some shishkeberry buddy?
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm making, you know, five star hash
with just two or three bags.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, Whoa, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had access to all this incredible
hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a very short period time after I
started selling bags that I started
[SPEAKER_17]: getting these questions.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, how do we get my hash to melt like
yours?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be like, Ooh, they are not going to
like the answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you just need to learn about the
symbiotic relationship between the micro
[SPEAKER_17]: rhizosphere and the roots and the fungi
intelligence that will help express plants
[SPEAKER_17]: and sequester compounds from your plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just going to need to learn about
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be about a 10 to 20 year
journey.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's going to take you through absolute
insanity and crop loss and failure and,
[SPEAKER_17]: and epiphanies and, and, and all of these
things, or, or you could smash a bunch of
[SPEAKER_17]: it into a tube and blast it with a Ronson
can.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is what 99% of that's why the HL
was taking off so fast in the early days
[SPEAKER_17]: because people who had material with like
the bubble bags just weren't the same as
[SPEAKER_17]: BHO in the, in the early days,
the bubble bags would give you a nice
[SPEAKER_17]: material.
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if it wasn't melty, it could still
easily be 50 plus percent THC A and B
[SPEAKER_17]: strong, but it just, it was those melty
photos that everyone wanted to be a part
[SPEAKER_17]: of.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was that melty shiny hash that everyone
wanted.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so they'd say, how do I get my hash to
melt like yours?
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, the next day they'd be like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can, I can blast this and it will be a
golden honey oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it was the beginning of a way to
make something that wasn't very good,
[SPEAKER_17]: look good.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, go ahead, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'll recall, when you started bubble
bath, I called you and said, Hey,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to crush your bubble bag
business.
[SPEAKER_16]: You did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to reaffirm that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then one other thing about Roberta is
Dr. Julian was the head scientist there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I wanted to get business with
them, I asked him, give me something to
[SPEAKER_08]: extract.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he gave me some four year old lavender,
all dusty in a box.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I extracted it and I sent it back to
him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next thing I know three, three days later,
I got this frantic phone call from this
[SPEAKER_08]: French guy who can hardly speak English.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is better than the fresh lavender.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to talk with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went in to Roberta and I sit down and
I became friends with Dr. Daniel Julian,
[SPEAKER_08]: who was the head scientist.
[SPEAKER_08]: He then was so enamored of the process
that he got on a jet and flew to Kansas
[SPEAKER_08]: and walked into the place to sit down and
see the whole setup.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, he kept shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was sitting there shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, Dr. Julian, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, yes, he goes, but I want you
to know that you're about 200 years ahead
[SPEAKER_08]: of the extraction industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am so happy to be here and see all
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And can I see you operate at once?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, sure, you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we became close friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we still are.
[SPEAKER_08]: We still talk.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to fit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that company bigger than you?
[SPEAKER_08]: You couldn't tell me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ask me about comparisons,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Julian, they were around the entire world.
[SPEAKER_08]: They source stuff in every country that
there was.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can I can find that out for you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to continue the thought because I
want it to finish and not be blaming BHO.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel the exact same thing happened with
Rosin when Rosin was released that
[SPEAKER_17]: happened with and it's kind of this double
edged sword that we're talking about with
[SPEAKER_17]: CRC and with a radiation.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's like, where can I find a
place for my mediocre product?
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that was a big thing when BHO
happened.
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, not everyone has amazing
product.
[SPEAKER_17]: The majority of people who were blasting
had mediocre product.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was turning into a golden honey oil and
it looked spectacular.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it wasn't until some of you people on
this panel started showing people what
[SPEAKER_17]: actual bomb product was and adding all
these little tricks and tips into your
[SPEAKER_17]: SOPs to really preserve and, you know,
get all of that goodness in the end
[SPEAKER_17]: result.
[SPEAKER_17]: It it just was a place for mediocre
product to go.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was the same thing with Rosin to
this day.
[SPEAKER_17]: I kind of say about Rosin all the time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Rosin.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have beautiful Rosin here right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got some honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_17]: It smells so loud and so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do feel I find that when I ask
someone if I can see the hash that they
[SPEAKER_17]: made the Rosin from, they never have it.
[SPEAKER_17]: They never want to show it.
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't want to flex it.
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't show it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I say the majority of Rosin is where
mediocre hash goes to die.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of white Rosin with no
flavor out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is you get exactly what you
asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that if we have a lot of
tools available to us, we can deliver on
[SPEAKER_00]: more of those asks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ask me for a white product,
a clear product, a blue product,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want, like I could make a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to know what you want and
ask the right question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a pretty significant ask of a
consumer, especially in a market where we
[SPEAKER_00]: went from not being able to talk about it
to then not being able to see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it, touch it or interact with it
when we buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it used to be that you'd at least be
able to smell that jar before you picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up a gram of that Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you do have to purchase it
visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to ask for a visual cue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a terrible situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to buy my avocados visually,
my ability to deliver on good guac would
[SPEAKER_00]: be diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just have to identify the
real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to smell the product before you
bought it, you'd make a different choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we have to purchase it visually,
a dark orange BHO extract isn't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look as good as a bright white one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I happen to know that I have had some
absolutely delightful dark orange BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just talking about all of his red oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visual cues didn't matter when we had
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people complain about the THC
argument, but give me any other number.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm going to get to Mark because he's
raised his hands twice.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, someone just mentioned in the
chat, oh, I agree, dude, but CRC is
[SPEAKER_17]: criminal.
[SPEAKER_17]: And another guy's like, it feels sneaky.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it connects exactly to what you just
said.
[SPEAKER_17]: People are purchasing based on their eyes.
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't created that system.
[SPEAKER_17]: We would love people to be able to test
it, touch it, smell it, feel it,
[SPEAKER_17]: and experience it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we can't.
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be purchased a certain way.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, obviously, I'm not a BHO guy,
but I just see that when you're... And
[SPEAKER_17]: it's very similar for rosin as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is why people are like,
let's cut the plant down a little early.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's make sure we lyophilize and keep it
in cold water.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's build a bubble chain and make sure
we pull taffy to get those air bubbles in
[SPEAKER_17]: there to lighten that bubble.
[SPEAKER_17]: These are forms of CRC.
[SPEAKER_17]: These are forms of manipulation and
sneakiness that we're not forced to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I say business people are somewhat
forced to do if they want to compete in
[SPEAKER_17]: the market.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's funny because it's always the
buyers, the people who are the buyers who
[SPEAKER_17]: are saying, oh, I don't like this and
that's sneaky.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, then start buying differently.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pay attention differently.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mark, please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first, I wanted to say hello to my
old friend, John Davis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to hear your voice again.
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, you have a Ken Nordine
twitch to your voice that's just
[SPEAKER_06]: irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's great to hear you again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, I want to introduce my friend,
Kind Bill here, who's kind of one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: OGs in the room, who knows a little bit
about extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he's got something to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, so stoked to see so many
here who I haven't seen in so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing but Eric forever, forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the first legal cannabis cup in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously been around with everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: John, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, to some of the points
first, when I first came into fully
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated market, making hash,
I hash was the only way I could get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't I couldn't get a badge.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dear friend, fellow cultivator,
you know, Phil Hay was like, hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: Billy, we can hire you as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you come back here and make some some
hash for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get to come and play.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we first set the machine up,
I was talking giddy up that the founder of
[SPEAKER_05]: Emotech and who I kind of developed lab
resin with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, you know, something
you're going to find out immediately,
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill, is it's the growers' fault if it's
good and it's your fault if it's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get used to that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, this is your world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I consider myself to be at
least that good at cultivating cannabis as
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been at extracting it and fortunate
that I learned on exceptional material.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was like a new world for me to
come into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This meant trash in and we want gold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, live resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: In those early days, man, we didn't
harvest rooms for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We walked really big, exceptionally grown
rooms and picked the five, six,
[SPEAKER_05]: seven best plants of each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself and like a Rye Pritchard or
Phil Hay level of careful harvested those
[SPEAKER_05]: plants very particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was taken care of that way all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only supposed to be that within,
you know, maybe three weeks, the owners
[SPEAKER_05]: came to me and were like, hey,
we got a room full of aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we freeze?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew this was my fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew that was coming from the first run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, when I opened the first pot of
live resin, I had a few, a series of
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts that weren't around the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: My very first thought was like,
wow, I'm going to be able to figure out
[SPEAKER_05]: how to never trim again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, we're freezing everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fucking out of the trim game.
[SPEAKER_05]: My second thought was like, wow,
this is special and good.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are probably going to fight about
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my third thought, I was like,
wow, I guarantee someone is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out how to use this to make
something bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it looks so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can right away out of the gate,
use this as a tool of destruction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it happened, you know, reliably fast
as commercially driven things do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody on this panel has the
capability of producing, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous quality setting standards,
refusing material.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see as much trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: People know I'm going to ask them why the
hell they think it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to have to explain to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, Mark and I were talking
about this on the way over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I don't want to reward that
bad behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the flip side, all of these separation
and purification techniques open up a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole bunch of cool new products and
ability to formulate and do things with
[SPEAKER_05]: products that couldn't be used.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same, I'm stoked that Rosin blew up the
solvent machine because the accessibility
[SPEAKER_05]: for a small producer to single source and
do a craft thing went up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think Rosin CRC for melts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ask everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I got my buddy trainer here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came to me with melts and Rosin and
fresh grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: The day I met him, I was like,
Oh, you give me many shits, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm smoking this product today.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know if you can see the
jar, but shout out to you, Jari.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill, tell them about your gig here in
Vermont.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm out here in Vermont.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: 802 Strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which ties into this conversation,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I came on a console and I was like,
wow, this is a market that has solvents
[SPEAKER_05]: for quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you can actually get paid to do a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ended up landing here at Zenbarn
music venue, vertical place, really
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Family owned, not a multi-state operator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Family owned business.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a buyback from my MSO that failed
in the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually super cool that mom and
pop Spencer, he bought a cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturing thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're doing some really cool stuff,
both the in-market and Rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, obviously if I'm not here,
I'm going to be bringing something we're
[SPEAKER_05]: building and yeah, it's super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of overwhelmed with what we enjoy
to see all these folks on the call.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eric, it's been a minute and you've been
on TV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's been, I usually don't do anything
like this.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's really nice to be out and about
and actually like be in the public.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Jenny for connecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was very, very, very awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: You contacted her too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, is that Jenny from Vermont?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shout out to, shout out to Jenny indeed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to give Adam had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, we were getting, it might've been
something that Bill was talking about it
[SPEAKER_17]: before we get too far away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Adam, please go ahead real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to build on what you guys are
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a question for the group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as solvent extraction actually just
found its niche in turning garbage to
[SPEAKER_04]: gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know like there's a few of you
guys that, you know, you came into this
[SPEAKER_04]: game looking for like that, like that
personal stash and trying to like figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out how you can get the absolute best
quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's also like stories in the group
of like, Hey, you know, process,
[SPEAKER_04]: process innovation was done through like,
you know, we had this batch that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that just didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually how I started as well
as like, I was looking, I was using bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: bags to try and get hash out of,
out of the trimmings for my grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how I found, how I found,
uh, uh, gray Wolf, gray Wolf's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, gray Wolf was hugely influential
for me in, uh, in kind of building those
[SPEAKER_04]: first closed loop systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but one of the, like the untapped
potential at that time was everybody was
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing their trim away and nobody had
anything that they could do with their
[SPEAKER_04]: trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: And BHL was actually something that you
could do that you could make, you could
[SPEAKER_04]: make shatter out of, out of, uh,
trimmings that people were just throwing
[SPEAKER_04]: in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, but you see this theme kind of
continuing carry through to today and
[SPEAKER_04]: people gets getting better and better at
making something that's marketable out of,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, out of, you know, either a growers
mistake or something that maybe doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have as much commercial value.
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like a lot of the things that
happens, it's happened out of mistakes and
[SPEAKER_18]: learning from things like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's like, it's the more places I've
been, the more you need to be able to find
[SPEAKER_18]: a place for everything that is grown
everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't want to waste anything.
[SPEAKER_18]: As a business, especially as it gets more
competitive, part of what we have to be
[SPEAKER_18]: able to do is be able to find a place for
things that, you know, cause there's
[SPEAKER_18]: always, you know, depending on the size of
grow that you're working with,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, we work with a really big one up
here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you know, it just depends on what part
of it, like the trim or, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to have people trim wet so I could
just get the trim, you know, do live resin
[SPEAKER_18]: with trim because that was a much better
thing for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it came out so nice, you know,
so much nicer than when you, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: have it dried.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I used to do that for a long time,
but yeah, a lot of it really just came
[SPEAKER_18]: from mistakes, things like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, like I said, I've burned myself
to all that stuff, but you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: when I have to do consultations,
things like that, you really need to be
[SPEAKER_18]: able to work with what you have.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like, you know, or else you go out
of business and then all the people,
[SPEAKER_18]: the families and friends you bring in who
you want to take care of, because it's
[SPEAKER_18]: been, you've been in business long enough
to where people have, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: throwing everything they have into it and
you really need to be able to come up with
[SPEAKER_18]: options for when, you know, like let's say
the weather's bad or things freeze or
[SPEAKER_18]: things happen, you know, especially
outdoor girls, things like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to be able to figure out
something or else you go out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Failure is important, but the rate of
failure I think is also pretty relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where prohibition comes
into play because when it was prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, everyone kind of developed at
a similar pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there would be one or two people who
showed up to Amsterdam and fucked shit up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it wasn't everyone showing up
with the new version of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of people showing up with
their version of the same strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even, you know, the proliferation of
the way we cultivate, a lot of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, happened at such a slower pace
under prohibition, but at such a more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have found really interesting
you know, I've been, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: training people on new systems and
consulting for a very long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every new market goes through the
exact same bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not learn from our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every new market comes in with wax and
shatter again before they get live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: and diamonds again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, we all have the same
extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been much innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: On stainless steel tubes in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, what that showed me is that
we can only, you know, innovate as fast as
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that rate of failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their cultivators have to get better and
fail more to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the extractors have to get that
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like almost that 10,000
hours sort of perspective where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need 10 runs that came out the same
and 10 that came out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out unexpected before you know,
you know, how the next 20 are going to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with any real experience under
your belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think prohibition has made it,
you know, this funny cycle where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see the exact, you know,
if France starts, you know, implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: new facilities, they're going to grow some
basic low potency schwag and some really
[SPEAKER_00]: average homogenous low flavor
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to do the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to slowly go,
they're going to make a hard candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't, you know, like we just do
the same stuff over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, part of that, I think is,
you know, not to put it all on the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, but the consumers are in the
best position to say, we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: start over from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us what they have start today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love learning about the
history of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I think the consumers should
demand the current version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about the consumer too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a reason why the demand for,
you know, lower lower end product is
[SPEAKER_04]: higher because people have a budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can provide that that,
you know, a better experience through
[SPEAKER_04]: using maybe CRC or using some advanced
kind of techniques to turn garbage to
[SPEAKER_04]: gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can present an option for these
consumers that, you know, like maybe it's
[SPEAKER_04]: better value for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're making a choice consciously
that, you know, that they know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know that that's why they buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, like I remember thinking carts are
never going to catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ruins the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll never I'll never be able,
you know, to go back to the days when
[SPEAKER_00]: carts weren't the only way you could make
a profit, you know, producing oil in a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's the consumers saying
we'd rather have it be more convenient
[SPEAKER_00]: than be more flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it is we have to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do tell us what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we and we say, but what if it could be
good in our, you know, margin of
[SPEAKER_00]: production puts ourselves out of business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe we do have to just embrace
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like mids.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in a commodity market where we're
price and cost of goods sold is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: always win.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the 800 pound gorilla in the room
is that it's cheaper to chemically convert
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD into THC than it is to extract THC
from cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being in the room,
I mean, all that hemp derived D9 that's
[SPEAKER_06]: out there is all from chemical conversion,
not from fractionation of mother liquor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's face it, we're in a commodity
industry here where price is always going
[SPEAKER_06]: to win.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Bill said, people drink
Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you on this crew here, people would
rather prefer like a heady IPA,
[SPEAKER_06]: something locally brewed and artisan
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the bigger addressable market
and, you know, look at moves that the MSOs
[SPEAKER_06]: have made.
[SPEAKER_06]: All big MSOs are now getting into the hemp
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Juana now has a hemp thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this hemp thing has completely
taken the market out and maybe sucked a
[SPEAKER_06]: little wind out of the high quality added.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's that next.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's that next level, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so Ryan Telly had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just I was going to say one thing prior,
but I think it might have.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, when Adam was talking about the early
days, turning trash into stash,
[SPEAKER_17]: I use the exact same term.
[SPEAKER_17]: That term has changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I said trash to stash back in the
day, like that trim was amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: It made five star plus bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Trash into stash doesn't have to mean like
mouse soaked urine soaked.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that's a we need to be careful with
the language that we speak.
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, what Adam is speaking of when
he does say trash to gold.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you can take material that's not as
good as maybe, you know, that's lost a lot
[SPEAKER_17]: of its margin that you can take.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can clean up a little bit,
make it an affordable product.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is this is the difficulty.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, I'm sure the majority of the people
on this panel, if we could, we'd make it
[SPEAKER_17]: so everyone was smoking the greatest
product in the world.
[SPEAKER_17]: But not everyone has the money or wants to
put their money towards that the same way
[SPEAKER_17]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_17]: So then it becomes a market that if you
want to see all those extractors get
[SPEAKER_00]: health insurance, you know, like we all
have a stake in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we you know what we need to do
is is really embrace our position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, in these roles, because like
Mark said, if the goal is cheapest D9,
[SPEAKER_00]: if customers say I want the cheapest D9,
that's what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to spend 80% of my
money at the dispensary on, then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: scale that up in a way that puts less
people at risk so that the people who want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do really cool flavorful stuff can hold
their market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a craft brewery doesn't try to
compete with Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to compare themselves to
Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be weird to they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's one thing I want to make sure
is like, well, you know, we may have found
[SPEAKER_13]: the niche in being able to be the good
recyclers of the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make sure we're not relegated to
that position, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's something that like has always been
my goal is to is to just get to the middle
[SPEAKER_13]: of the tricone, you know, like strip away
the cuticle, the, you know, the secretory
[SPEAKER_13]: cells, I just want to get to just the pure
as pure the oil as I can.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on my journeys, I've found that to be
butane extraction.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and I find it to be, you know,
like when when you have great weed,
[SPEAKER_13]: and, and, you know, I consider a good hash
maker, a good hash maker is only as good
[SPEAKER_13]: as their ability to grow or curate good
material to me, you know, like if you want
[SPEAKER_13]: to talk about like, at the highest level,
you know, like, you know, competition hash
[SPEAKER_13]: making when it comes to like, you know,
solvent list or solvent, it really comes
[SPEAKER_13]: down to your understanding of cannabis at
that point is just like an, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: as as a cultivator, and, you know,
at an intuitive level.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure that like,
that's, that's put in this conversation
[SPEAKER_13]: here, because I know, like, Yari,
and a couple other couple other people,
[SPEAKER_13]: probably, I want to make sure he said that
because Yari is a hybrid living soil,
[SPEAKER_13]: single source, all the way to the end,
and he crushes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I remember selling him commercial
equipment and it fucking up his oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, like, I remember that it was
weird to hear that story again today,
[SPEAKER_00]: because like, I haven't thought about it
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think about that a lot where people
are ruining their own products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, by trying to adapt to a way that
the market wants us to do it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think there's so much opportunity to
innovate, you know, when we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can really focus on what our goal is,
if every extraction is a experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know, you can do good science and
not prove your hypothesis, but like have a
[SPEAKER_00]: goal before you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make fire does not count.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's not all of it's going to catch
on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not really a, you know,
the goal has to be more specific than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the goal is make the cheapest D9,
get your efficiency numbers up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be the most efficient at
extracting tannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be the most efficient at
extracting terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but a lot of people look at
saying, I have the coldest solvent tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They measure things that are weird and
extraneous instead of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their ability to achieve their,
you know, intended output.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Murphy, I wasn't, I wasn't using that
as like, like knocking on you.
[SPEAKER_19]: You helped me as much as I, Oh,
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember not being able to solve
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I still don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, but I mean, uh, what Telly brought up
is a good point.
[SPEAKER_19]: And like, that is the, I am, I'm on a much
smaller scale than I'd say, probably most
[SPEAKER_19]: of you, but me doing everything on my own
and being in control of all of it,
[SPEAKER_19]: I can see all the variables when something
works better, when something doesn't work
[SPEAKER_19]: better, all of the things that I've
learned have been from all of my own
[SPEAKER_19]: mistakes with all of my own material.
[SPEAKER_19]: So doing all those things over the year
has got me to the point where there is no
[SPEAKER_19]: trash.
[SPEAKER_19]: There is no mess ups.
[SPEAKER_19]: There is no bad stuff anymore because I've
already failed every way that you possibly
[SPEAKER_19]: can.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, but being in control of the
clones, uh, making a tissue culture room,
[SPEAKER_19]: growing everything and living soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm on my 58th round of the same soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been 10 years in the same dirt.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, all those things contribute to hunting
the best terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've done side-by-sides with people that
grow rock wall.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got the same cuts.
[SPEAKER_19]: The turks just come out better than living
soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk about some of the cuts?
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you running now?
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I've got tons of cuts.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, there's a lot of stuff that I've been
growing for like 15 years, uh,
[SPEAKER_19]: that I've, that I've just kept around.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there's always new stuff that
we're trying out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And my circle of friends is the same,
but, um, I have an eight light room.
[SPEAKER_19]: And a nine light room.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I try and do a one new strain or not
one new one, but one strain per table.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that I just always have like the
biggest variety of flavors and some are
[SPEAKER_19]: the staples.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'm always peppering new ones,
but there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what, what I've been seeing that's
pretty interesting is that although I
[SPEAKER_19]: would say some of the newer generations
wants the candy and the gas and all the
[SPEAKER_19]: hype stuff, there's a lot of people that
when I do these old school ones,
[SPEAKER_19]: they're gone as soon as I tell somebody
they're available, they're out the door,
[SPEAKER_19]: strawberry cough, the four Collins cut
super lemon haze, a great Cola.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's probably one of the oldest ones
that I've done.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like there's, I probably have,
I think 40 or 50 cultivars in the,
[SPEAKER_19]: in the grow room right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and, and no one going back to things,
um, it's interesting because we were
[SPEAKER_19]: talking about colors of stuff and like,
it seems like the consumers dictating what
[SPEAKER_19]: they want.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not really like the best outcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like everyone's so hyped on this white
Ross.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when people are pulling it at six
weeks, the plant isn't even close to
[SPEAKER_19]: getting to its maturity to really produce
the best that it can, especially on the
[SPEAKER_19]: terpene level.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's pretty strange.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, like that, that is dictating people
are more concerned on like the color
[SPEAKER_19]: versus like the flavor and the experience
of the actual hash itself.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's always been a hard thing as far as
quality versus what the people want.
[SPEAKER_18]: What I consider like what I like to smoke
versus what I find other people care about
[SPEAKER_18]: tend to be different things.
[SPEAKER_18]: It always surprised me as I went through
the business of like, how is it that you
[SPEAKER_18]: don't want the best flavor thing,
whether it looks yellow or not,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, to me, that was always the thing
was the flavor.
[SPEAKER_18]: And like the note was like what,
that's not what people care about
[SPEAKER_18]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes it's strange.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes it's not even smelling because
they have kids or they don't, they don't
[SPEAKER_18]: want something that has a strong smell,
you know?
[SPEAKER_18]: So it, there is definitely a market for
everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems like, yeah, the super high
quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's sometimes not as sought after in
certain markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we just lack the language
for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've negated the education as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: In the sense that people go and buy your
product.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't necessarily know what each
product is, nor the extraction process
[SPEAKER_14]: that got it there, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And most people have waited to see what
the market dictates as opposed to putting
[SPEAKER_14]: out the diversity because of the costs,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't run a whole bunch of different
skews, package them and get them out the
[SPEAKER_14]: door, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are real world situations where
the market itself educated itself as
[SPEAKER_14]: opposed to y'all educating the market,
correct?
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is for the most part kind of an
opposite way of doing things, but the
[SPEAKER_14]: market followed.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the understanding of what quality is
and the different levels of production,
[SPEAKER_14]: I think is still something missing to the
average consumer because we at the
[SPEAKER_14]: dispensaries are still fielding lots of
questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: They still don't understand the extraction
or they're still afraid because it says
[SPEAKER_14]: BHO on it, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you've all dealt with the
repercussions of, oh, you're evil,
[SPEAKER_14]: bad and pushing petrochemical,
bad, evil shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they don't understand this is the same
process that your coffee is decaffeinated
[SPEAKER_14]: with, okay?
[SPEAKER_14]: That you've been drinking for decades.
[SPEAKER_14]: So stop with the fear mongering and
understand the different levels of
[SPEAKER_14]: process, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the dispensaries don't have the
educational tools nor have we been given
[SPEAKER_14]: them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something we've had to self-educate
to take forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how do each one of you decide which
products skew you take forward in a new
[SPEAKER_14]: market?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a challenge and a question into
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually that's not an extractor making
that decision, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, guys, we wouldn't have had
Viber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wanted that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: How come it doesn't shatter?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets my jar sticky.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you use it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was working at a place that had nine
stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a vertical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were able to train budtenders to be
like, just close your eyes and smell this
[SPEAKER_05]: and decide if you want this or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people wanted it when they smelled it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: When I met Mark, I showed him a pretty fat
jar of dog waltz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of side eyeing him right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He grabbed it right out of my hands and
stuck his fingers in there and stuck it in
[SPEAKER_05]: his mouth because he was so overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, back and forth whether I
hated or loved him for being able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the soft serve ice cream of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a privilege of Colorado,
though, I will say, is we have always
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained the ability to have a sample
product for people to smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of places that the
budtender has never smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sealed up and individually
packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person who grew it has no idea what
that final nitrogen packed tin can smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that data point, consumers are using
every piece of information we give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we give them is flashy packaging,
weight, THC, and maybe a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like giving them the language
to ask for what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them would say they want more
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them would make a sacrifice for a
lower potency and more broad flavor if the
[SPEAKER_00]: price point fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to use every piece of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give them so few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we say to each other about it
is the strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we intuitively know, oh,
you have some papaya melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do want to see that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you have honey banana melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a look at that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I'm looking for gas,
every once in a while I run into some
[SPEAKER_00]: people who always have sour diesel wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sour diesel wax is still the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fire is a useless phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is the one that means a lot to all
of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all learned and defined what that
fire is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers don't have that same
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us who want that fire will still
smoke a clean sourced cart when we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation at a Thanksgiving family dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all recognize that there's a
time and place for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us have our drawer like wine
aficionado would have a cellar of a fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle that we just have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got this little half gram of some
special stuff that I take a little dab of
[SPEAKER_00]: from time to time and save for nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the language of how we share that with
consumers is really lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the solvent space, it's usually
a lot of us saying we want education,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then a marketing department who is
detached from both cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_17]: The enemy.
[SPEAKER_17]: The enemy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Marshall wanted to chime in.
[SPEAKER_17]: But before he did, we were talking about
color.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was going on in my head.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought, wasn't it Bob Marley who
said, until the color of a man's hash is
[SPEAKER_17]: of no more significance.
[SPEAKER_17]: Than the color of his eyes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Had to drop that one because I was feeling
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Marshall, continue the conversation.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I also wanted to thank Etienne for
coming in.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I was really trying to keep the
panel today really sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: oil and hash oriented.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think Etienne brings a really great
perspective from that dispensary
[SPEAKER_17]: perspective as we're talking about the
customer.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know if you guys heard it as
loud as I did, but I heard there's a great
[SPEAKER_17]: disconnect between the processors and the
dispensaries who are selling their
[SPEAKER_17]: products.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think Murphy made a good point that
that is that marketing department that
[SPEAKER_17]: steps in and has no connectivity to either
of these processes.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Marshall, please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I don't have the experience in this
industry like you guys do at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just wanted to give you guys my
personal perspective on this because I
[SPEAKER_02]: have, you know, had pieces of it here and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I grew up in Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very conservative, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never thought of cannabis legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any state, let alone many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm living in Washington now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington is one of the states where you
cannot open any of the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do anything with it,
but look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you can smell the whole store,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it smells good in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also then in between living in Utah
and Washington, I lived in Humboldt for
[SPEAKER_02]: six years, seven years, roughly on and
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I knew people growing and I could
go get it from them or hang out with them
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe I was spoiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that experience in comparison to what
I have here in Washington, I do not go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the rec shops anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I've actually almost nearly
stopped smoking because I can't go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: store, get something that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw away thousands of dollars worth of
products because I smoke it once and I
[SPEAKER_02]: throw it away because there's something
wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: After seeing the way people growing it
personally and seeing what their products
[SPEAKER_02]: come out from that, I don't know what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why it's so different for me,
but I can't ingest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this also comes back to the synthetic
making D9 from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I currently work at a large hemp
extraction facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell drones of ethanol and CO2 extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hurts me personally to know that
this is now what's going on is that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could be selling this to somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could then be making it into D9.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be then going into a distillate
with fake terpenes added to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then sold literally as live resin
carts in the shop and you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't, even when you go to the
website, they'll tell you they're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can analytically very easily tell you
whether or not that's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can taste it and tell you whether or not
it's real pretty immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody wants any help trying to help
battle this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand where the market
struggles, then these other synthetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: become cheaper, people start using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we deal with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, the idea of growing up in
Utah where it was so conservative,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in this place where it's possible
now and all I see it is destroying itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, so if there's anything I can
do to help analytically, sensory,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, any of this stuff, please reach
out to me because I believe in all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff being medicine and also just
personally enjoyable from sensory and
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, something else like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I struggle to see what's our already
happened to it here in Washington,
[SPEAKER_02]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you analyze and quantify flavonoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot personally right now,
but I do have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single person I've asked for 10
years since that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I have a lab a couple blocks
from my work where I can, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a huge opportunity for us
that we're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when we started being able to test
for terpenes, it was good info,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of us recognized that the terpene
number was too low based on our
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, like the volume of the flavor
part versus the terpene number.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the color.
[SPEAKER_06]: The color is not likely cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: The color is likely flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could name them and quantify
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got to remember too,
in the plant, there's two parts to a
[SPEAKER_06]: flavonoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a glycoside, there's a sugar
portion, and then there's what's called
[SPEAKER_06]: the aglycone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically by the time you got into
extraction or you're getting to
[SPEAKER_06]: distillation, you're certainly only
dealing with the aglycose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are really super colored.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have very high extinction
coefficients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a very little bit will color a whole
big batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other thing I wanted to go back to
was the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it or mice piss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mice piss or mice urine is water soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it was oil soluble, it would still
be inside the mouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are extracting and you're using
a non-polar hydrocarbon, yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not going to get all the water
soluble crap that was in the mice piss,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's all water soluble,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was fat soluble, it would still be
in the mouse, right, John?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, before we travel off in
another direction, because I'm starting to
[SPEAKER_08]: run out of steam.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: A terpene that nobody really has been able
to extract successfully in any large
[SPEAKER_08]: amount called hashenene.
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard of that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, people find it an extremely
old hash and they can meta out the
[SPEAKER_08]: hashenene, which is a very syrupy golden
liquid that tastes like the best hash
[SPEAKER_08]: you've never had in your mouth ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have discovered a way to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we did was we took five pounds of
a certain kind of oil train wreck and we
[SPEAKER_08]: froze it in a nitrogen freezer for maybe
three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of those three years,
I pulled that out, put it in the vacuum
[SPEAKER_08]: oven and passed it into a collection
device, which I got off of the care
[SPEAKER_08]: memberhood element.
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing would collect tiny droplets as
the rest of the oil was going by.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be hashenene.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I found out that if you do five pounds
of the train wreck, that you can end up
[SPEAKER_08]: getting about a quarter pound of this
hashenene.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't want to see that disappear
into the ether because I don't know if
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody else that looked into it or
anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a paper published in 2011 by a
group over in Switzerland, I think of all
[SPEAKER_06]: places, and they found it only in the
areas of hash that were exposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the same group basically that
identified hashenene, they used all the
[SPEAKER_06]: analytical chemistry, you know,
mass spectrum and all that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: identified the molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: They also postulated how it was being
formed, again, in a photolytic reaction of
[SPEAKER_06]: mersene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mersene can absorb a photon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it does, it becomes an excited
state and rearranges into hashenene.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, that paper was published in
2011, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Mark, are they finding it in hash
that sees really deep vacuum for extended
[SPEAKER_05]: periods of time as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought they were finding it in
these long, cold shatters, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be totally wrong about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I read something on that in maybe
2014.
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as I know, hashenene has never been
proven to modulate or potentiate THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you don't get high off smoking it at
all.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just is an amazing flavor, a terpene
beyond terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but you can smoke all of it you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't get high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took it with me to Emerald Cup,
one of the first or second ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at one of the booths, I ladled some
into a couple of pipes because everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: was asking, because at that time,
I was being observed quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put some hashenene in the pipes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next thing you know, we had a
group of 100 people follow us around
[SPEAKER_08]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some guy named Chance was pushing me in
the chair that I was in.
[SPEAKER_08]: He would go to a booth and go,
hey, Indra's here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then 100 people gather around because
everybody wanted some of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashenene, even though they weren't
getting high on it, it was an incredible
[SPEAKER_08]: flavor, something that's not to be missed
if you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have about a quarter ounce of it
in my freezer and in a jar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I take it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I end up buying crappy weed from the
shop or something, I pull the hashenene
[SPEAKER_08]: out and dose it with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that's sneaky.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you keep, if you keep hashenene
around for decades, then it turns into
[SPEAKER_09]: something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to smoke some haze in your
honor.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was my resin card question.
[SPEAKER_19]: So live resin carts have hit the scene for
a hot minute now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do any of you guys make live resin carts
and how much HT do you actually use?
[SPEAKER_19]: To call it a live resin cart?
[SPEAKER_18]: Like probably like a third to 40%.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say something like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I do 70% HD.
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's what I would prefer.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like just straight, just like that
straight.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even like the melt mix for my
personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like the super terpy, but you know,
that's like, I just use the GC and dose it
[SPEAKER_00]: by a total terpy content.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you just use HD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's HD, but because I fraction
everything, I can pull, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter and heavier back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, to start with,
I wouldn't call it HD if you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anything over, I would say 20%
at the most, but you know, 10% would be
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal of dissolved cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people call things
HD that are really, you know, nearly 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still other cannabinoids, THCA and stuff
that's dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for it to be, you know,
clean enough and high enough purity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've still got flavonoids, you've still
got esters, you know, all kinds of oily
[SPEAKER_00]: things compared to like the, you know,
really more volatile terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I just aim for that specific
terpene content, because my HCE is all
[SPEAKER_00]: very watery because I've fractioned it,
I know that it's, you know, gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 40% terpenes, and then,
you know, another 20% of that other
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people are putting out,
even again now, back to the language
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, we call it high terpene extract,
but some people's high terpene extract is
[SPEAKER_00]: 7% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they could put that 100%
in the cart and it still wouldn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor profile, you know, and some
people's high terpene extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're decarbing and heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've changed that profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1000 ways that Mark would love to nerd
out about probably for us, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rearrangement and you know,
how some of those are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the way we even define
HCE is still really vague, because high
[SPEAKER_00]: should have a minimum threshold,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me some.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, send me some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send you some?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna save it for decades though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I heard we got to smoke it fast is
what I heard from Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love that interaction though,
watching, you know, Sam bring up is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, biologically relevant,
and for you to say no, it's just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of the big marketing
issues we've run into is that because we
[SPEAKER_00]: had to market this legally, as a medical
product to create an infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were marketing literal medical
products and America markets medical
[SPEAKER_00]: products better than any country in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by better, I mean, you know,
with deception and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we haven't been able to say
this is important because we like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had to say this is important for
your mood, for your inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: for your medical, whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so marketing has been twisted into
this, you know, need to impose a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: value on a feature of the product rather
than just embracing the value.
[SPEAKER_09]: Murphy, you do understand that when you
combust or vape labonoids, you deactivate
[SPEAKER_09]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the medical benefit,
we're talking about food and that's where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that marketing gets completely
lost to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now consumers are trying to eat
gummies that have terpenes added that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do, you know, I don't know what,
and they're not getting a flavonoid count
[SPEAKER_00]: or any kind of nutritional, you know,
there's so many valuable parts of that oil
[SPEAKER_00]: that we throw away, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just mute that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just muted the mic.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did want to talk about something that
also feeds into exactly what we're talking
[SPEAKER_17]: about here in the sense of, you know,
extracting these aromatic volatiles.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we love them.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people love this high terpene
extract.
[SPEAKER_17]: They love the flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_17]: At what point in time, cause we know what
the capabilities of these compounds are,
[SPEAKER_17]: especially in purity, at what point will
we saturate and hit the number that is
[SPEAKER_17]: like, you know what, this might not be
good to be, um, volatizing or vaporizing
[SPEAKER_17]: and inhaling into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember when Tony started doing the
terps with blue river extracts and blue
[SPEAKER_17]: river extracts, Canada, we were doing,
you know, terp dips and just dipping our,
[SPEAKER_17]: our full melt bubble right into like just
like a jar of like water clear.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we were calling them terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: I would suspect they were probably should
be named more accurately aromatic volatile
[SPEAKER_17]: compounds, uh, because I'm sure there were
other, you know, thials and thialates and
[SPEAKER_17]: esters and other things present other than
just terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: We just didn't have the capability of
perceiving them, uh, with analytical
[SPEAKER_17]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, what, how much is too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we've all tasted a cart
that was too much before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue is that, you know,
we've allowed the agricultural nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and the way that every harvest
can be different to cross over into the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a good excuse for every batch
to be different in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the amount of flexibility that we
give the batch should be limited to those
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, to those volatiles, to those
things that are actually unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we see that very plainly
when we look at the label on flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can have a room of 15
different aromatic profiles and flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: with one or two percentage points away
from each other in potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, to recognize that margin
of variance, you know, would require
[SPEAKER_00]: imposing that in our manufactured products
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the fact that most
people don't even put the terpene content
[SPEAKER_00]: on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they do, do they have a
standard for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is someone, because you can have
flour at 1.8% terps and concentrate at
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.8% terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sale today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't make any fucking sense.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_17]: Adam, Adam and Marshall both have their
hands up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I think it was Marshall first and then
Adam.
[SPEAKER_17]: So go, go ahead, Marshall.
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you put a hand up?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not very tech savvy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, are you on a phone or a computer?
[SPEAKER_17]: Computer.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's down, I believe next to react,
like next to share if there's a little
[SPEAKER_17]: heart.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a drop down or pop up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not, I'm not too good with this shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I will say before Marshall goes and
before Tony goes, or not Tony,
[SPEAKER_17]: I was saying Tony because Tony's the guy
that's in the room chatting just said,
[SPEAKER_17]: Nate, Yari's carts are the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: Best thing out there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Little, uh, little, little props for you
there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_17]: So go ahead, Marshall, and then Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the topic of, uh, how much is too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think also the delivery method can be
pretty important and how hot you get the
[SPEAKER_02]: oil and how it's being volatilized off of
the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so for instance, if you're dabbing,
uh, with any amount of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can create acrolin and other reactive
aldehydes that can actually really damage
[SPEAKER_02]: your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Studies out there, people dying from this
from dabbing for a certain period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're using a hot nail, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how you guys do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually never done that just because
it just looks like smoking crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what he's sort of doing that in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I just roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I deal with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but we must bring you to the dab side,
my brethren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it will happen, but, uh,
I make a lot of oils, uh, where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as well, I've, uh, dosed some of the
terpenes into or, or oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to call it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of other compounds in
there besides terpenes into beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I overdose myself one night,
uh, kind of on accident, didn't have lab
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment to the, to dilute it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a stainless steel, um, like straw that
I had in the, in the kitchen, dip that in
[SPEAKER_02]: some oil, put that in into some Everclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I diluted it out into some alcohol and
then took one drop of that Everclear into
[SPEAKER_02]: a beer and kind of swirled around the can,
smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a sip and it was either, it came back
to the top of the beer and was
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrated or it was just too much in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, I did this kind of for hop
companies making flavorings and things for
[SPEAKER_02]: beers for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've tried this before, but first time
with him, uh, it, it was like a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: strong stimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It for sure dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: My blood pressure increased my heart rate
and it was intense for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that's where I did overdo it in
a beverage, uh, just that one time when I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have lab equipment to actually get
the dilution right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was too much, um, smoking wise
though, I've never hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely do a lot of sensory and the
oils we're making and I can just smell
[SPEAKER_02]: these things all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely get high for about a half
hour as you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, they're, they're also,
you know, like we're talking about with
[SPEAKER_02]: solvents, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are better for the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mircine is definitely carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the major components in there,
especially if you're doing a good job,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, extracting it, it's got two terminal
double bonds that are reactive potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: and can cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too much is where, you know,
you're just overindulging.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the level of concentration of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the right amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may taste great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may smell good, but it's probably not
great for you, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: removing it from the plant matrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it was designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we evolved with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I would consider it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it if you want every once in a
while, but I wouldn't go smoking really
[SPEAKER_02]: high HD all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably will lead to problems.
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting perspective for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Marshall.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Adam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Jorge after.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know that's, uh, the feeling as
well, because I'm pretty sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: The terpenes, especially in a cart,
a super interesting though, about like
[SPEAKER_04]: the, maybe the carts that I smoked were
not really vaporizing it at the right
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, but I was getting like just
really bad, like kind of burning nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if it gets over probably about 5%
terpenes in a cart or like 5% like
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that's in the HTE really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but really I think another kind of
good thing to bring up here is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's good opportunity for,
um, some of the crystallization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Processes as well, where you can separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Murphy, you're mentioning HTE,
but being able to separate the HTA out
[SPEAKER_04]: from the, uh, from the, um, THCA,
then you can actually create like a
[SPEAKER_04]: standardized product, reformulating those,
creating repeatable formulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the repeatability here is
like, is a big factor as well as like,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, a lot of what has been brought up is
really just missing standards in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like if you look at the wine industry,
um, you're not allowed to call,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, something, um, you know, uh,
champagne unless it's from a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: region and produce in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's missing from our industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you end up with, um, I don't know
if someone mentioned that, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, buying a live resin cart,
but it's just like D9 from hemp mixed with
[SPEAKER_04]: like some like terpenes that they bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, what's missing there is,
is really like the, the standards,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, not just for marketing, but also for
like how it was produced and then getting
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody on the same language.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like that is an interesting
perspective that we've covered many times
[SPEAKER_17]: here on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: And whenever I go back to thinking about
it, I feel that, and it really feeds right
[SPEAKER_17]: into what Marshall just said, that the
plant matrix knows how to create it the
[SPEAKER_17]: safest way, even though I've been chain
smoking concentrates for like 25 to 30
[SPEAKER_17]: years.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, hopefully I'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, yeah, it's, uh, what was I going to
say?
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to lose my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that we're not perceiving everything
that's present in a, in a, in a
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabinoid and aromatic volatile compound
profile.
[SPEAKER_17]: So those profiles have a variety of things
that never are understood by us that we
[SPEAKER_17]: don't.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is why I wanted to do this
aromatic profile show with, with Nick
[SPEAKER_17]: Ziegler and Marshall and a bunch of others
and get these people, his colleagues who,
[SPEAKER_17]: who designed this equipment that was able
to perceive these thials and thialates at
[SPEAKER_17]: such just unbelievably small, uh,
fractions.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's the, my worry about reformulation,
uh, which I guess would kind of echo a
[SPEAKER_17]: little bit about what Marshall was just
saying is that if we're missing too much
[SPEAKER_17]: of the picture.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I say too much, yes, these
compounds are in way smaller amounts,
[SPEAKER_17]: but for anyone that has ever had the
exposure to thials, uh, you don't need a
[SPEAKER_17]: lot.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that is that funk and that garlic and
that it's so strong that I theorize.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not a chemist or anything,
but from the conversations with Nick and
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Mark and different people that this
giant terpene profile that we give all
[SPEAKER_17]: homage to is balanced precariously on a
much smaller, delicate profile of smaller,
[SPEAKER_17]: lesser percentages that can shift that
thing from rotten baby diapers to
[SPEAKER_17]: strawberries in a very, very, very small
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that we know that because you
can buy off the shelf terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_04]: like, if you were going to test the
terpene profile of a plant, it looks
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly the same as the formula from off
the shelf kind of a botanicals,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you taste it, you know,
it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_17]: Something's missing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Please hold.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, uh, it's a, you're up.
[SPEAKER_17]: You've had your hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, by the way, Adam, I just want to share
like my experience on, on like with these,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played with CRC a lot and then a lot
of testing and also with HTE.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start from the beginning,
like back when they were saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, CRC is removing terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I did a lot of testing on that and
found that actually the terpenes at least
[SPEAKER_01]: look, the footprint looked identical,
uh, to the amount of terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nothing was being offset or extra,
maybe a few 1%, I mean like points of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, percentile kind of a conversion say,
but the flavor was still there
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I looked into it further,
uh, I used the UV light and found that the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids, which, uh, will glow in that
once they're absorbed into the media and
[SPEAKER_01]: the absorbance, they were showing up in
the, uh, media and that was, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor that was being pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was associated with the flavor loss
say, but when I looked into it further,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, uh, that's where you say how
much is too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those compounds are a little bit
heavier, so they're going to give you more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a harsher taste to the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CRC is actually balancing it and giving
it like a more better profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, people thought like,
okay, the red was more like it needed more
[SPEAKER_01]: CRC to remove that color, but that red is
like, we already removed the color with
[SPEAKER_01]: CRC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the chlorophyll, uh, and the other
like flavonoids, you know, the other
[SPEAKER_01]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that red was more, from like the
carotenoids, which are just basically like
[SPEAKER_01]: a hydrocarbon chains that were breaking
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were oxygen atoms were attaching to
it and making them xanthophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're looking red and that's the
red we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were never going to pull out that
red with more CRC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where people use too much of it
and gave it a bad name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially once we went into,
uh, looking further into the HTE,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started looking into say, de-waxing the
HTE and that came from pushing it through
[SPEAKER_01]: a micron filter using nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would allow it to basically
de-wax it and pull even more heavier
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And started playing then with like,
uh, making my own vapes and found that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, I don't know if you guys dab
distill it before or just like pure
[SPEAKER_01]: distill it or diamonds, but it doesn't
really just, it doesn't give you that full
[SPEAKER_01]: high, you know, it's like a little bus
that it gives you really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started noticing like, okay,
you don't really need that much D9,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, to get you that high where you're
comfortable, you're satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes more from going into say,
when you go like to, uh, how do I say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, when you add the other HTE
components to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you add like a 90% cartridges,
which unfortunately is what a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries are going for, they just look
at those numbers and if it's 90% or
[SPEAKER_01]: higher, that's what they're shopping for
to put on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, you don't need that much
because the flower comes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with very little and it does the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that's telling me is that you
really just need about 40, 50% say D9 in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cartridge and the rest being HTE and
other stuff to, uh, basically modify that
[SPEAKER_01]: high and give you that full spectrum
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just basically wanted to touch up on
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just from my experiences that I've tested.
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like the more terpenes like that,
it does give you the better effect and
[SPEAKER_18]: it's not about the THC number and it is
about the full spectrum terpene effect
[SPEAKER_18]: with the entourage effect that they call
it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've been able to lean on full
spectrum within the industry as like a
[SPEAKER_00]: catch all because we also have these kind
of, you know, intuitive, we know what fire
[SPEAKER_00]: is because we, you know, have seen the
best and the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just to shout out abstracts,
I think, you know, to give us a language
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows us to identify that category
that we've been calling Terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which is probably more
appropriate than terpenes because terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: is a real thing and Terps can be a made up
one, you know, put a Z on it maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if we could just start
categorizing, you know, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Marcus brought up to put the,
to put the number on there wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily communicate the influence of
that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could even, I imagine just a pie
chart of how much of this is volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so if we were to,
instead of saying high terpene extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were to say extremely highly volatile
terpene extract versus medium volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are your Terps popping the lid every
time you open them at room temperature or
[SPEAKER_00]: do they not, you know, are these Terps
that are weighted by oily flavorants
[SPEAKER_00]: because to add that flavor category that
isn't a volatile aromatic is also really
[SPEAKER_00]: important because like what I was just
saying, you ask us for no color,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can give you no color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ask us for no flavor and no
color, we can give you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you ask us for flavor and no color,
you might be wrong about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for because sometimes the flavor
you want has color, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be able to clarify what people
are getting out of it, if we could give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a representation of this,
this is a product that contains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an agreed upon, we define what's
high, you know, because no one's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say this is a medium level and no one's
going to say low even being able to say
[SPEAKER_00]: low THC, you know, is an impressive
achievement for the hemp industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, because we've just, you know,
we've built ourselves up on delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: high, but if we could start addressing it
like volatile aromatic flavor and then
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid potency as extractors,
we could start really innovating and our
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation could be delivering for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be delivering our own efficiency,
you know, like we started harvesting rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: for extraction, we started growing strains
for hash making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we could start chasing resin for
individual compounds, this shit could get
[SPEAKER_00]: better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do need the language for what we're
looking for, because we've been calling it
[SPEAKER_00]: some pretty generic terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've exhausted the Turks,
no amount of mercy is going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference to me, the way a little bit of
humaline does the way a little bit of file
[SPEAKER_00]: the way like those small numbers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is a way for us to
communicate that to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does start with the science,
we do need more people to just add it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tedious work and investigating it
and coming up with a standard for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's effort, you know,
but that's, that's the work that on our
[SPEAKER_00]: end we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get done with that,
we can't stop, we have to then communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: it out to people in a way they can
understand it so that it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so that if you tell me to
percentile, I'm like, ooh, spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean anything to anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to figure out how that message gets
all the way.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: Jorge had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Max, you're right after him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: One observation I made, like touching up
on the color, because the colors there,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, because the chlorophyll is
there, once you remove it, this oil can
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidize quickly if there's say no terpenes
to protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some like side observation I've seen
on that, I've had HTE that wasn't fully
[SPEAKER_01]: purged that sat for like, say,
a year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the hydrocarbons are
protecting it from the oxygen bonding to
[SPEAKER_01]: it and oxidizing it because the color is
and smell everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just like when I extracted it,
you know, and it was the stars that were
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting around waiting to get processed,
you know, and like said there for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: like over a year old, and it seems like
they were just fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to see if you guys have
seen also a similar observation.
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely feel like that that is
something that happens with the oxygen not
[SPEAKER_18]: being in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it preserves it for a long time if
stuff has sat around for like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's already in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some of the OGs in the group could
speak to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a lot of like perfume industries,
you have some of those less odorous,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly volatile compounds in with your
desirable odorous volatile compound to
[SPEAKER_00]: help keep it in and keep it from
degrading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the higher volatility of it,
first of all, kind of like a nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_00]: an argon, like it does, it keeps the
oxygen from getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also because they repel water,
it keeps water out, which reduces,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, additional reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times, you know,
like butane and isobutane are preservative
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes in aerosol products,
because they will just keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from changing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super effective system that gets
ignored by, you know, regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because we just sort of get a
little bit of tunnel vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've absolutely seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's common in other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why we know that butane
was food safe in the first place is
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's put into like dairy products
and stuff as a, you know, as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preservative and propellant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in the perfume industry, they use
fixatins like ambergris from Wales.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_16]: Max, you're up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to go back to what we were
talking about just a moment ago,
[SPEAKER_12]: what Murphy was talking about the like
quantitative versus qualitative components
[SPEAKER_12]: and how there's not necessarily a direct
correlation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I've got anecdotally to share
with you is is a little cannabis adjacent,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's a new discovery that I thought
was really fascinating for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working on some R&D at Medically
Correct, some stuff I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_12]: talk about too much yet, but it's for an
edible product that's going to ultimately
[SPEAKER_12]: be a cinnamon thing that's got capsaicin
in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're playing around with capsaicin and
we've got some pure capsaicin isolate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And wow, it has really increased my
respect for what nature can produce and
[SPEAKER_12]: just synthesize through a plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason I'm bringing it up is
because we were playing around with how
[SPEAKER_12]: much do we put in here?
[SPEAKER_12]: What is going to be like palatable?
[SPEAKER_12]: We want it to be fun, not too subtle,
but not too much.
[SPEAKER_12]: And through the R&D where we landed at is
the amount of capsaicin that is going into
[SPEAKER_12]: like a single serving is three one hundred
thousandths of a gram.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like really impressive how spicy
it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like like spicy food and wanted to push
it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did some internal R&D within the
company.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're just getting feedback from
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm telling you, at three one hundred
thousandths of a gram, some people were
[SPEAKER_12]: like, this is maybe a little too much.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, just going back to
people who want to look at a potency test
[SPEAKER_12]: and what are the numbers say?
[SPEAKER_12]: What terpene is this and that?
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, the difference between
quantitative and qualitative value is not
[SPEAKER_12]: a direct correlation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just felt like that was one where
you just got immediate feedback.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the capsaicin is so in your face.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just such a not subtle thing that
that was just a recent revelation I had
[SPEAKER_12]: that's got, for me, respecting peppers and
just the earth so much more than I did
[SPEAKER_12]: before.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just wanted to throw that out
there as food for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Scoville, you know, range was,
you know, came up with for that exact
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, because you can't communicate
those tiny decimals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that pictures of a number of spicy
peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: At my factory in Kansas, we once extracted
two thousand pounds of fiery red peppers
[SPEAKER_08]: and it produced about 25 gallons of this
incredibly red oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we opened the chamber up to have
a look at it, all of a sudden we could not
[SPEAKER_08]: take a breath in or out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our breath was frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: We ran out the door, opened the door and
ran out.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're outside drooling and spitting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And while we were out there, two mice ran
out of the building as fast as we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It turns out it was a great mouse remover.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that stuff is scary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had to go through quite a process
to get it out of the chamber and pack it
[SPEAKER_08]: up and send it off to the people who
wanted it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But very, very dangerous stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, we only use analytical
grade isobutane for all extractions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just probably a good, probably a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for sharing, John.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also to the vanilla receptor and the
Caspin receptor interplays with the CB1
[SPEAKER_09]: and the CB2.
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a little drop of knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did want to welcome J.M.
[SPEAKER_17]: to the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Etienne, Etienne obviously we heard
from already.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's always good to have him.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a regular panelist in the room.
[SPEAKER_17]: But are you still around, J.M.?
[SPEAKER_17]: Or did you turn your phone off?
[SPEAKER_17]: And oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just got to unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_17]: Unmute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm used to listening to Has Church and
not chiming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to break the ice here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Marcus, for doing that for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting conversation regarding you
know, the total flavor we experience when
[SPEAKER_03]: we smoke hash or, you know, dab hash,
save it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And herpene, how much is too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been of the mind that the
flavonoids as we ingest them in a vapor
[SPEAKER_03]: are not really contributing to flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played around with, you know,
watching the media and trying to add that
[SPEAKER_03]: back up minute amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't seem to help much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually was horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wonder if you look at citrus oil or
just a lot of essential oils that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, refined for flavoring is,
you know, they will do what they call
[SPEAKER_03]: folding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you'll see like a orange
essential oil that'll say five fold or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, tenfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're doing there is actually
removing or reducing the amount of actual
[SPEAKER_03]: herpene to increase the ratio of
terpenoids, which I'm pretty sure are
[SPEAKER_03]: generally a little more volatile,
but, you know, contain more of that
[SPEAKER_03]: quintessential flavor of say a blood
orange versus a mandarin orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder, Murphy, when you talk about
fractionating your HTE, are you running
[SPEAKER_03]: into that through a column to kind of
split the different classes or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just copying, you know,
what any other analytical instrument would
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll just run through either a
silica and T5 so that I can get high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, high resistance or through
alumina if I just want, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal separation and I want it to go
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the media is doing a really inert job
of just being a stationary phase and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just high pressure, controlling the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just copying what, you know,
an HPLC GC would do so that I could then
[SPEAKER_00]: elute things based on, you know,
and what I do is, again, I always call it
[SPEAKER_00]: fractioning because I don't have to know
when it's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to have a lot of jars,
you know, a lot of containers ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got, you know, a falling film,
so it's pretty continuous, but then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just collecting things as they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they come overlapping, I can do it
again, make it longer, make it slower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just by controlling that pressure and
feed rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I get is different jars that
sometimes need to be combined and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes need to be reprocessed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what caught my eye and ear
years ago when you started doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: butane phase chromatography.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've sent all your jars to the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most of them can't be tested though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to test for waxes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brought up, you know, what's the
value in the flavonoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect point is can of flavon
contributes a lot to a texture and a
[SPEAKER_00]: viscosity and color in your oil and
whether or not it has a medical benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smoke it and at what level it's
got, you know, bioavailability when you
[SPEAKER_00]: eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a lot of, you know, very
complicated questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I want to communicate to a consumer
why this color yellow is okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this one isn't, I want to have a thing
to say that counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in fractioning, what I have is a
bunch of jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them, I can't say what they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of them smell horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them ferment rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got jars of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so what I do is I keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I when I'm reformulating,
what I'm actually doing is just removing
[SPEAKER_00]: things based on my own bias and the few
things I can quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things are the safest parts of
the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can quantify THC, the only part that
won't kill me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, John, John, can you can you introduce
yourself because the panel hasn't met you
[SPEAKER_17]: yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have some we have some hands
up.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have let me just figure this out real
quick.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was Marshall again, who would be
first after you introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Yari has his hand up as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: So go ahead and introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, long time listener, first time
caller here.
[SPEAKER_03]: True story.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real, I started sci fi system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, but 2016 or so I come out of the
broader natural product space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, working with isolating compounds
for the biomedical drug discovery market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've always loved cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I quickly found that the cannabis
industry was a real chill industry
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to dealing with the more academic
side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that was really what made
me switch completely to start sci fi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, at the time, I had a lot of business
relationships with equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will remember when some of these
folks wouldn't even associate with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a prime time back then to bring
those two worlds together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm just loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a much cooler, more casual industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the questions and unknowns are,
gosh, this plant is so there's a lot to
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take for granted that we just put
butane in a tube and get oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a lot to it, especially as
far as what we're talking about here,
[SPEAKER_03]: sci fi and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're happy to have you here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Marshall, you're up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just briefly on flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name comes from a flavor from your
tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bittering component like the
polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flavonoids are biochemically sort
of the cannabis in between of the aromatic
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and the terpenes and the
terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Formation and the polyphenol formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the polyphenols are the water soluble
bitter components, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the flavonoids are kind of in
this gray area in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to analysis, there's methods
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of having access to the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to start doing analysis
on flavonoids, that's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of finding the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been picking up old analytic
equipment on auction sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully one of these days I'll have
all these capabilities in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter, again, it costs a lot of
money even just to run them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like $20,000 just to get the power
hooked up to my house to put one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: instruments in, even if it didn't cost me
half a million dollars to buy outright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I'm working on those sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a curious person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I ended up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sensory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then production is chemist in that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, we can make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a matter of finding the equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that it takes the person who cares
about it, and then it takes the money to
[SPEAKER_02]: invest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's equipment out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a bunch of professors at
universities that let's use their
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment if it was a good project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and don't discount the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of analytical chemists don't realize
that everyone else doesn't know that for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to turn it on and calibrate it to get
a baseline before you can start testing a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard, if you already have a method and
a standard, you're putting just days of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort into some of this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to give you one sample and say,
tell me what's in it, that could be three
[SPEAKER_00]: months of work and calibration and
rerunning and development and sample prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it doesn't always translate
directly over to that product infused into
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tremendous amount of time that
someone has to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started buying analytical equipment and
quickly learned I don't have the patience
[SPEAKER_00]: to run a GC.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yari, you got your hand up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Murphy, I had a question for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: How come you run your HTE and fraction of
it through T5, which will muddle instead
[SPEAKER_19]: of leaving it as it is when it comes off
the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll use T5 as a dehydrating process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm just going to fraction HTE,
if I have something that's already liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've got THCA, out of the mix,
then that'll just go through Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 just allows me to go at much higher
pressure because otherwise I would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through a super long column,
which would just, I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I get a ton of
resistance out of that T5 and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: blended with the silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just there to slow everything
down.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is T5 a media?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a bentonite clay that's been
acidified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, so that it's going to be a
little bit more similar to silica gel in
[SPEAKER_00]: that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can hold a lot of water
specifically, and it's a very fine powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably finer particle size than the
silica gel, but the silica gel is really
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the chromatography lifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that process, what I'll be
able to do is get easy stuff out at high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to heat it up and get the
everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that everything else can get
refiltered if we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I skip that part, then you get a
bunch of the water soluble, water
[SPEAKER_00]: miscible, water adjacent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, T5 will help hold onto
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be, there'll be terpenes,
other things in there that you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of, I always call it
sorting my laundry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me what's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll have, you know, an
accumulation of jars that are for later
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll come back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like no cannabinoids left behind,
but you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: But why do all that work to formulate them
back together again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that work is absolutely a function of
getting shitty weed and having to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: best product you can from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the weed is fucking old and gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all your weeds all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The living soil guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: The living soil guy is like, what the
fuck?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what, what could you possibly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I even loved your sound of disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get those degradation components.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you go from like the wax,
that's the cuticle of the terpene to like
[SPEAKER_00]: these degraded fatty, acidy oil things
that are, like I said, sometimes it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: truly fermenting in those final jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to get, I'm going to skim
the cream and then I'm going to go back in
[SPEAKER_00]: through the best of the rest later.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so I don't know a ton about the media.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really just kind of met the media bros
recently and was talking to Adam about
[SPEAKER_17]: them a little bit, but is there a big
difference between these powdered and
[SPEAKER_17]: granulated mediums?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like what this is just for, I guess it
quickens the process or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they all do a different, if you were to
think of them in the way that you think of
[SPEAKER_00]: your different bubble bags can target a
different trichome size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each media could be designed to target a
different chemical category, particle
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they could have a different pH,
which is going to have a different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of reactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's they could each their individual
tools in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're used together with
intention and sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that intention is to,
you know, give us trash to gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's to analyze or purify.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are, you know, even when they are
similar, they're extremely unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of like someone
brought up the W1 earlier, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as, you know, just an Illumina or
a clay that's been ground to a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of them can be really, really
uniquely applied.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or used frivolously, you know,
or used frivolously.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's what I, it was interesting to
hear Jorge talking about how it was like,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, when we started using it,
we just used it like in small amounts.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, the kind of problem was
people came in and were like, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: just stripped everything out of their kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So like I said, I don't have a huge
experience with this.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely interesting to talk about
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glaze, clays are layered silicates.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unlike silica gel, which is just silica
particles, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Macroporous silica particles, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which are the same kinds of things that
are in some HPLC columns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most HPLC are run in what's called reverse
phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they actually have a fat soluble
moiety that holds onto the compounds and
[SPEAKER_06]: separates the compounds all based on
polarity.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but silicates are just, yeah,
there's a variety of different kinds.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually nano silicates called
halocyte, but yeah, betonite clays are
[SPEAKER_06]: just, they're layered silicates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in between the layers of silica,
you could basically trap all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's typically based on the size of the
compound, whether or not it could fit any
[SPEAKER_06]: interstitial space between the layered
silicates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you'll hear about exfoliated
clays.
[SPEAKER_06]: What exfoliated clays are is when they
peel away those layers to basically make,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, non-layered silicate,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, a little chemistry on
silicates.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask a chemistry question to a chemist.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get a chemistry answer,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I played the media bro's little
video while you were doing it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like getting all fancy over here with
my hash church, but no, I appreciate the
[SPEAKER_17]: conversation today.
[SPEAKER_17]: You also have your hand raised,
but I guess you've already spoke.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll go back to Jorge, who has his
hand up again.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Jorge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just want to kind of touch on the
media too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, I like to look at it
like Photoshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have all these tools on the left
side, you know, and each one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: medias, because they're different in pH or
structure, like bentonites, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like a generic word for clays,
there's like kaolinites, mectite,
[SPEAKER_01]: hadapulgite, like, and all these are going
to pull or have like a stronger affinity
[SPEAKER_01]: for something else than the other,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you understand all these things
and test them and know how they work,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can basically have like your arsenal
of tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Murphy was saying, and come in with a
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to say crystallized,
the reason like W1 would work is because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you turn the solution acidic,
the extract is going to crystallize a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better versus something that's a basic or
neutral and same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just depends on your purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your purpose is to bleach, then,
and you have something that's higher in
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, then you would go for
something that's more acidic and vice
[SPEAKER_01]: versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all just basically tools and
we should get like more knowledgeable on
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be able to basically perform
better like CRC extracts instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and stripping everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a huge opportunity for
education here because what I'm seeing in
[SPEAKER_04]: the market is mostly people want like the
easy button and not a lot of extractors
[SPEAKER_04]: want to learn or like really have that
much expertise in like what are the use
[SPEAKER_04]: cases of each of these different compounds
and how to kind of use them with
[SPEAKER_04]: precision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the time it's just like the
goal is just to lighten the color or to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a consistent marketable color for the
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're just looking for like fast
flow so that it doesn't slow down their
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just running everything
through CRC as just kind of like the
[SPEAKER_04]: standard operating procedure, because a
lot of this is kind of like top down,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, from management type of thing,
like directives and not necessarily coming
[SPEAKER_04]: from like where Murphy's coming from with
like precision and like science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had to overly invest in that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of this comes from if I might
not see my potency change at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: only my yield going in and out of the
specific media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that's the only number I can
measure is potency and terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we know aren't going to be impacted
by specific medias, then how do I measure
[SPEAKER_00]: that change in the flavor, positive or
negative?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need a data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to start sending samples to
Marshall, maybe, you know, something.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, well, the man with all the flavors
has his hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Yari, what do you have to say about
that?
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to add and point out a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_19]: So like I said before, CRC is a good tool
and you really need to know this.
[SPEAKER_19]: This kind of goes back to the grow things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like if you know the strains that you're
growing incredibly well, you can adjust
[SPEAKER_19]: appropriately to what individual powders
that you're trying to use to do like their
[SPEAKER_19]: individual job.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I mean by that is like I've had
friends of mine that have come to me where
[SPEAKER_19]: we've run their extract before and it's
it's strain specific, but some of them are
[SPEAKER_19]: so overwhelming with the terpenes and in
their HT and everything that they almost
[SPEAKER_19]: need a light CRC and finding that right
media, which doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_19]: The big problem with the CRC thing is that
if like you guys were saying, if you strip
[SPEAKER_19]: it too much, strip everything away,
the taste is awful or bland or not there
[SPEAKER_19]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_19]: So knowing the cultivar and knowing what
individual CRC powder does, you can play
[SPEAKER_19]: that to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have gotten to the point where I don't
CRC anything myself because I found the
[SPEAKER_19]: sweet spot on where to take down the plant
where it was at their peak within a couple
[SPEAKER_19]: of days.
[SPEAKER_19]: A friend of mine gave me a little hint on
that, that we did do analytical testing to
[SPEAKER_19]: find when a certain campanoid dropped to a
certain percent was at the peak of the
[SPEAKER_19]: strain.
[SPEAKER_19]: So doing that and then like I said,
running stuff for other people when the
[SPEAKER_19]: terps are overwhelming can still,
I mean, no one will know that it will CRC
[SPEAKER_19]: if they've done a good job and use the
appropriate amount of powders.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they get misused and that's what
screwed everything up in the industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just like everything, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just always the same thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: You start out in this sort of ignorance
and then you gain knowledge and sometimes
[SPEAKER_17]: that can lead you into bias.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then as you gain your experience,
you sort of realize, oh, maybe staying
[SPEAKER_17]: more over in the center and gaining
information all around me is a better idea
[SPEAKER_17]: than, well, I mean, I was completely
insane.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just like, I was convinced everyone
just had to have full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just was like, of course you have to
have full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_17]: You have this, this is the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the best because that's what I
thought.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I'd meet people and they were
like, no, this is the best.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd be like, how can you even say
that?
[SPEAKER_17]: And you just get over your own narcissism,
dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just let people have what they wanna have
and let people explore.
[SPEAKER_17]: And at this point in time, I saw my
affinity for cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think it all has its place.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all a journey, it's all pathways.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the more we explore and the more we
uncover, because like Murphy said,
[SPEAKER_17]: we don't really do new shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of like fish when they would
say, I think Paige was interviewed and the
[SPEAKER_17]: lady was like, why would you jam for 42
minutes?
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, well, so I could hear the
43rd minute.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't get to the 43rd minute of
jamming without doing the other 42
[SPEAKER_17]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't get to hop, skip over the jam.
[SPEAKER_17]: The jam is the journey.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I guess that's true for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's interesting because I see it with
cannabis that she doesn't necessarily want
[SPEAKER_17]: people to cut corners and find tricks.
[SPEAKER_17]: She's always just like, no, it's gonna be,
you just have to, I think the day we stop
[SPEAKER_17]: trying to get cannabis to bend the knee to
us will be the day that we truly find
[SPEAKER_17]: success with our relationship with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because prohibition tried to get cannabis
to bend the knee and it did not work out,
[SPEAKER_17]: let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Money was spent, people were jailed,
lives were ruined.
[SPEAKER_17]: And here we are all these years later.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank God we have an industry room.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Mark.
[SPEAKER_17]: You look like you're anxious to say
something unhappy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just realized who JM is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that John Mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey John, how are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if our Hash Church
audience will remember, but when I went to
[SPEAKER_06]: visit Indra in 2017, I think John got
inspired and came down to Indra's house
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we actually met, I think, through a
Hash Church connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the first PhD that I had met that
wakes up with a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to thank John for hosting us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a nice session with Danny from
Kurova, who I think has been on the show
[SPEAKER_06]: before.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, Marcus, didn't we do an
episode from John's place?
[SPEAKER_06]: There, I think, maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we did.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all muddled and fuddled in my brain.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got like hundreds of these episodes
under the belt at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of hard to remember eight
years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marcus, yes, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to mention one more thing
before I sign off, because I'm running out
[SPEAKER_08]: of gas here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in the hospital all day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: My blood sugar spiked to 500.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a very difficult time for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I only managed to survive it by the hair
of my chinny chin chin.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to mention that one of the
ways of choosing how your extraction
[SPEAKER_08]: happens is I used to run a coil from the
isobutane, and I would hover it in a
[SPEAKER_08]: bucket so that I could get the overhead of
the liquid nitrogen to cool the gas to
[SPEAKER_08]: various temperatures.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by doing this, I managed to extract
the very lightest things first.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so anyway, it's just, I don't know if
anybody's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the CRC, the air conditioning
stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: The magic dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the magic dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's column chromatography.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just column chromatography.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyway, I just wanted to mention
that that was a method that I had
[SPEAKER_08]: developed and used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad you're well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody say hi to Eten.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Eten.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, my brother?
[SPEAKER_08]: Long time no see.
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad to see you're alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Live and well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to visit your pot shop when I
come down to get my teeth fixed by the VA.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be there to wave at you in person.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, you guys, I'm I'm worn out,
so I'm going to sign off for the day.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, thanks for being alive, Indra.
[SPEAKER_17]: And sorry for telling people that you were
not alive.
[SPEAKER_17]: And wow, I didn't get to see it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But people were freaking out in the chat
when I said, I'm going to bring someone
[SPEAKER_17]: back to life.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you gave up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you got that rumor from my son who's
lost to Beth.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we'll hope for the best for Johnny
Starr.
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully, you know what?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's we say it the same as with oil and
everything else in our life.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes we just got to make big mistakes
to learn to learn big things.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll we'll pray that Johnny Starr is
going to learn from this experience and
[SPEAKER_17]: come out of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're really glad to see you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're glad that you're alive and we'll
be seeing you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for coming on, Indra.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hello to everybody who I didn't say
hello to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is Sam speaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, old friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing my best trying to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_16]: Aren't we all doing it, brother?
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I feel like goodbye, brother.
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought, oh, Yari, Yari had his hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Yari.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to keep it all together here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, J.M., does your company build those
membrane filtration systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you guys are in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here near Portland.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you guys have you guys used those
with psilocybin extract?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unofficially, I know someone who has.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I was at Sambo Creek about that,
because, like, that's the one bottleneck
[SPEAKER_19]: that people are starting to see is the
solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's like the one thing that,
you know, nano filtration does very easily
[SPEAKER_03]: across the board that you can be fully
competent, plug and play, no issues or
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, we're working with
natural products here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the composition can vary quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other interesting thing with the
mushrooms, you know, is the sugars,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And getting a more concentrated extract,
you know, away from those sugars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's tricks that can be done that
the membranes also come in handy with to
[SPEAKER_03]: remove those to a great degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that's nothing that we've
worked on.
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to say, but.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'd like to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Outside of the the the chat about that,
because I'm pretty interested.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'll make sure that you guys all
have access to one another, particularly
[SPEAKER_17]: just, you know, if there's one particular
or two particular every whatever you need,
[SPEAKER_17]: just email me and I'll make sure that you
have the right email for the right person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will say there's there's quite a
few membranes that are used even in like
[SPEAKER_00]: preparatory chemistry for like analysis
that are for like removing sugars and fat
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used quite a few of those with
mushroom extracts in an effort to test
[SPEAKER_00]: them because it's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I just won't even put a
chocolate bar in my HPLC column anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can just fucking ask somebody
else to do it because I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's quite a few membranes that
you can get for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about that is you can get
those in like, you know, almost syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: size or like little cup size, you know,
so you can do little samples before you go
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the big system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can figure out where you really do
have to scale because some of the good
[SPEAKER_00]: ones for solvent want you to have a pretty
clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of oily fats in some of
these mushrooms, too, which is and that's
[SPEAKER_19]: why I asked because it's such a more
difficult oil to work with, because like
[SPEAKER_19]: I've heard of people doing following films
with them and completely clogging their
[SPEAKER_19]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of cement, you know,
cement, and I don't know what,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, you guys know Coleman Shapiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, he seems to be having a lot of fun
doing that all these days.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cordyceps extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a lot of people are out there
clogging the bottom of their filter
[SPEAKER_00]: reactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, trying our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I'd love to know,
and maybe, you know, Jay, I could work on
[SPEAKER_00]: this is maybe we could make those
membranes out of a mushroom derived
[SPEAKER_00]: product so they could be more affordable
to fuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us out, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just grows like the mushroom just
grows on the permeate tube and I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how we got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stripped it from the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow a more intentional one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be that'd be dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, probably grow it right in the
housing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be sick.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think it's time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's everyone puffing on?
[SPEAKER_17]: I just smashed some event horizon for my
last dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'm going to hit some Masterpiece
90 micron first wash melt.
[SPEAKER_17]: Decent.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not I'm not even trying to plug this,
but I don't know if you guys have ever
[SPEAKER_19]: smoked out of an index.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have an index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big table one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Murphy, do you have the bird, the new one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a new I have like a maybe one
of the first like the record version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a record player.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like I went on the Amazon and
bought like a whole roll of tubing so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could just like throw them away carelessly
because in science, you just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable plastic is part of the job
somehow.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's a killer unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really it's too much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I need it built into a
whole table.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's for sensory science.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's for having friends over to do
sensory science like that is exactly what
[SPEAKER_17]: that is for.
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say and nice to see Sam lighten up
the Carta and I'll let everyone tell what
[SPEAKER_17]: they're going to puff on.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I got I got this doctor dabber switch
to recently and I didn't realize it's an
[SPEAKER_17]: induction unit.
[SPEAKER_17]: This thing is actually pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like a little small portable
unit, even though I've literally carried
[SPEAKER_17]: like elite motherships around in Pelican
cases onto the Blackcomb Mountain to rip
[SPEAKER_17]: dabs while I'm snowboarding in the middle
of the day or take out on my sled sled to
[SPEAKER_17]: the Pemberton ice caps and do rips in an
ice cave.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like a you know, 40,000 years old
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will say that this thing is pretty
fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you get a chance to rip one and you're
a big for anyone that's into flavor.
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, induction heat is kind of as
long as it's delicate induction heat.
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say I don't know a ton about it,
but I do know that I have probably nine
[SPEAKER_17]: different units, including Riley's index
labs unit, as well as I spire the one Luna
[SPEAKER_17]: gave me in Berlin and a variety of other
units.
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some that are just too much.
[SPEAKER_17]: They just they their lowest tap when they
start is just way too high.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like the index labs and as well as
this unit, I can turn it down so low that
[SPEAKER_17]: I can take rips of my dabs and have them
taste different, like really different.
[SPEAKER_17]: With the low to the medium to the high,
I feel like Marshall's like ready to say
[SPEAKER_17]: something.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like turned his camera and he's like,
what are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_17]: Sensory science here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got some shit to say.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a PhD.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Marshall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, just in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so almost all the work I did
in the hop industry was connecting the
[SPEAKER_02]: sensory to the analytical work for beers
and hops and hop extracts and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's fun to be able to work in the
cannabis world as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with mostly him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't even imagine what we could do
getting hands on good, real material like
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a messier output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought having a GCMS would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out it's just work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you feel no progress ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stop running it longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, because it'll keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shig will keep showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool science, but it is it
is really hard work to break those
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds all the way down in a way to
analyze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's tough is that our ability to
perceive it, you know, is a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like these really complex
analytical instruments still can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: apart the like, you know, that black
pepper versus the white pepper in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, damn, you know, we really
are still pretty far from automating that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to know with certainty, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would have an existential crisis
if I was an analytical chemist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've said for years,
because, yeah, when you get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: weight of it, it's like, wow, how do we
know anything is anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you could be wrong for so
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could you could trick yourself and
make a peek out of anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: About, you know, the sensory aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the most important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I got what I call the gusto
factometry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're dabbing, I call that gusto
factometry, you know, gusto flavor like
[SPEAKER_03]: the food stuff, you know, the olfax
sensory, you know, commentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, everybody there, you've got a
gusto factometer in your house already.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most sensitive analytical instrument.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, you've got to test stuff for
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important because there's all
flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we all know the issue with like
possible contaminants that even rec labs
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't able to test for or don't know to
test for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you might can taste it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, anything so important to try
your dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested about this index,
though, because I.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a cheap instrument.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's probably the most fancy
gusto factometer out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that the doctor dabber that is
market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it similar in giving you that lower
temp range if you want it?
[SPEAKER_17]: This this the it's not as broad,
but there's at least a nice enough sliver
[SPEAKER_17]: that makes it so nice to have at your
tabletop.
[SPEAKER_17]: The index is like an invite.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like in high school when you set up
the Dungeon and Dragons table and invited
[SPEAKER_17]: your buddies over.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not a thing you just do on the
random.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is some shit you prepare for.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is like hey, we're going to do
sensory science with my buddies.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be able to test it at such low
temperatures that you're you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: you're kind of ripping monos more so than
anything.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you can go through into the
sesquiterponoids and get into these
[SPEAKER_17]: completely different flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they fucking hide each other from one
another.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, like there's a reason why we
cure the monos out in flour, because you
[SPEAKER_17]: get this kind of like, oh, it doesn't
smell that good sometimes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you cure that out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now this this new bouquet has arisen
underneath, you know, the one that is
[SPEAKER_17]: volatized off.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that in itself is going to be an
absolute art form in how people,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, cure or preserve their material.
[SPEAKER_17]: Listen, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was at least in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you guys can speak to the butane world
and Telly's got his hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: So he'll be next.
[SPEAKER_17]: But in the cannabis world, it was,
you know, flavor rule.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, the bubble hash world.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just all about that flavor profile
and what you how well you could get the
[SPEAKER_17]: flavor from the plant profile to be like
the same, but just completely concentrated
[SPEAKER_17]: to a point where it's, you know,
mind numbing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Telly, why don't you go ahead?
[SPEAKER_17]: You had your hand up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is something I think a lot of BHO
people can notice just from leaving,
[SPEAKER_13]: leaving products in a vacuum and doing
doing some tests with a vacuum and just
[SPEAKER_13]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that you notice like every
once in a, you know, you've got some
[SPEAKER_13]: things that are just really blow out,
you know, really top end sort of on the
[SPEAKER_13]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you vacuum longer, you do you lose
some of that perceptual masking and you
[SPEAKER_13]: open up some of some of the heavier
terpenes that just get blown out by these
[SPEAKER_13]: things that like kind of blow out your
senses, but don't don't translate one to
[SPEAKER_13]: one to like the tongue and olfactory
experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something I've definitely
noticed from the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that sometimes like, especially if I'm
entering something for a contest,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, I'm going to hit it and maybe
back it, try backing some of it a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bit longer to see what happens to it and
see, you know, like, OK, if we take some
[SPEAKER_13]: of the top end off, will it will it open
up and can we get some more out of this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is this just sort of a very top end,
you know, high pitch kind of spectrum?
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Marshall, I wonder if you had any
insight on maybe some things like the way,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, Murphy said, like, we're all
going to be doing the same things.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, have people like maybe we should be
following a little closer behind the hops
[SPEAKER_17]: industry because you got the amount of
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like we talk about how expensive this work
is and how cannabis has really only done a
[SPEAKER_17]: fraction of the work that needs to be done
because we're still fighting margins and
[SPEAKER_17]: racing to the bottom to create our
industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: But beer has a foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_17]: It has money to invest.
[SPEAKER_17]: The hops industry is fucking big.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so do you see any advantages to,
you know, some of that stuff that was done
[SPEAKER_17]: to hops with hops in the analytical labs,
being able to translate over to cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: and help our industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that's kind of how I ended up
here was we had all that equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot about these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge overlap between hops and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, when you go and ferment
beer, there's another gigantic range of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that come into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: For changing the flavor and the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, it's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But analytically, our noses are better for
very specific components, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sulfur compounds, the thiols are
tens of thousands of times more potent per
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule than almost all of the
monoturpenes or zespoturpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you get these really
crazy aromas like burnt rubber or armpit,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the thiols over-concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other class compounds in here
are the aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are ones, unfortunately,
that a lot of the bad aromas you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want, that you want to remediate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, bentonite clay specifically
selectively binds aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of why it does some
remediation on older material.
[SPEAKER_02]: But analytically, they're difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I've loved to see what
I've learned is that you've got to trust
[SPEAKER_02]: your nose and your equipment if you know
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to know the limitations of
your equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your nose, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The sulfur compounds will blow out your
ability to smell the rest of the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where the aging and all the
curing really comes into play and how
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have different oxidation
timeframes for a breakdown or
[SPEAKER_02]: volatilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pulling vacuum or heating it again,
doing all these things are going to adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: the relative concentrations and then give
you that aroma profile that you want from
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where, honestly, making
concentrates and extracts and things can
[SPEAKER_02]: be tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually take something that's
beautiful and turn it into burnt rubber,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've now over-concentrated a
bunch of stuff in it that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've got to burn it off a little
bit to get it back to where you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if nothing else, I've learned a ton
from the work that I did there because we
[SPEAKER_02]: had the equipment and we had the money and
the time to spend doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a 25-person trained sensory
panel to compare the sensory with work
[SPEAKER_02]: with the analytical results that we were
getting from the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had the lab equipment where we
could analyze all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love to be able to do that same
work in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's about finding the equipment,
finding the places where we can do this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff because it's been not allowed for so
long.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a part of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we're going to be able to help
you with that by having you back on the
[SPEAKER_17]: show and maybe doing a specific show on.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was thinking this would be part of
the Aromatic Volatile Compound Show,
[SPEAKER_17]: but perhaps it's focused more on what we,
the cannabis industry, can learn from the
[SPEAKER_17]: hops industry that had a 25 team sensory
group to learn about those SOPs on how to
[SPEAKER_17]: run a proper sensory team.
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, I mean, Nick's told me this
from day one.
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, step one is you have to find out
what your blind spots are.
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to identify what your blind spots
are.
[SPEAKER_17]: What can't you perceive, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not that easy to figure out,
but you need to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other one was sort of like,
what are you perceiving in more of a hyper
[SPEAKER_17]: manner than what the rest of the group is?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a little above that middle bar.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're hyper perceiving certain things
where you're like, oh my God, can you guys
[SPEAKER_17]: smell that?
[SPEAKER_17]: And everyone else is like, no,
I don't smell it the way you do.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we kind of got into those two things
and I thought, man, this is a really
[SPEAKER_17]: interesting conversation that I think I
haven't really heard a lot in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: industry that seems ripe for Hashters.
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe if you're down for that,
we can get some of the people that are on
[SPEAKER_17]: the panel today and some other new people
and we can do a sensory discussion in
[SPEAKER_17]: regards to, I'd love to get some people
from other industries as well,
[SPEAKER_17]: although hops just does translate so well
because really it's another aromatic
[SPEAKER_17]: inebriant that people love worldwide.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it has these different shared,
I mean, God, there's relations.
[SPEAKER_17]: For goodness sake.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you bring in Robin Mojave?
[SPEAKER_14]: They've been writing articles on hops,
which is absolutely fascinating because of
[SPEAKER_14]: course we've seen diseases cross,
hoplite and viroid comes from hops,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is fascinating because when I was at
the Cannabis Germplasm Institute from the
[SPEAKER_14]: USDA in Geneva, New York last year,
there's a section in between when there
[SPEAKER_14]: was the huge homogenous field that was
growing 517 different ascensions plus the
[SPEAKER_14]: males with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was a row that we went through
and they were growing hops on purpose.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that I thought was rather fascinating.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I plan to talk to Larry Smart and ask
them more about that crossover because
[SPEAKER_14]: they're already looking at it at the USDA
level.
[SPEAKER_14]: John has his hand up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to go ahead, John?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to say one,
I envy the beer industry for how much
[SPEAKER_03]: further ahead they are than our industry
in terms of what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one critical difference, and this ties
back into discussions that were happening
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier, between the two industries right
now is there is a huge lack of public
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like legal public consumption with beer,
you can go to a bar and get served up and
[SPEAKER_03]: try all sorts of beers that you would
never go buy just a six pack of to try,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can try single.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing like that really exists,
at least here in Oregon and mostly U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: for hashless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to affect what the
consumer, the retail side is demanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find that there's a lot of people
that just have not experienced a proper
[SPEAKER_03]: dab and aren't going to go and throw a
bunch of money at a gram that they've
[SPEAKER_03]: never tried before.
[SPEAKER_03]: God forbid they can't even smell it before
they buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's going to be a critical
piece, too, to lift in all this forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we keep repeating the cycle,
you know, because no one in a new state
[SPEAKER_00]: can do anything other than see it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using all the data they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically none.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, in California, they've just allowed
food in dispensaries besides, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: for the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would expect to see some pairings
starting to happen, you know, some chefs
[SPEAKER_14]: and more of that starting to happen
because, you know, more legitimacy to take
[SPEAKER_14]: place as well as I would anticipate a rise
in dab bars.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem with dab bars is is the
the individual who thinks they have the
[SPEAKER_14]: tolerance to handle it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are the people who we have to
call the ambulance for because they
[SPEAKER_14]: literally pass out from being too high.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is where that proper SOP comes in for
sensory experience of extracts.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the importance of like creating
this voice of authority.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's you know, it's it's so important.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's kind of yeah, I just I hate to
hear people having bad experiences.
[SPEAKER_17]: Please go ahead with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to, you know, at the lower
end of the heat range, are you able to
[SPEAKER_03]: generate a vapor that is mostly labor and
less than 100 percent?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I envision, you know,
the wine and wine and cheese level of
[SPEAKER_03]: hashish someday where people who aren't
really, you know, cannabis users are able
[SPEAKER_03]: to appreciate the wide wide range of
flavors this plant can produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not a dabber and you take
even a small dab, you're going to you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not going to be able to enjoy the second.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, wondering how do we someday
be able to allow people to enjoy the
[SPEAKER_03]: palette that have no tolerance and even.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this is this is the work that Dr.
Mark Lewis and Chimera did at Napro,
[SPEAKER_17]: which was to go through and produce type
two plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: That are not high in THCA and to create
all the flavor profiles that are available
[SPEAKER_17]: in type one plants and make them available
in CBD.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shanti Baba has been selling CBD like
cigarettes in like the grocery stores in
[SPEAKER_17]: Switzerland for like, I want to say,
20 years, but maybe it's been longer now.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there there is a whole world out there
that just wants to enjoy the flavors of
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think Napro is probably ahead of the
game in regards to producing cultivars
[SPEAKER_17]: that it goes to kind of speaking like,
you know, it's the same with edibles,
[SPEAKER_17]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like if you're going to have or these
dinner pairings that Etienne just
[SPEAKER_17]: mentioned, if you're going to have these
types of dinner pairings, you better be
[SPEAKER_17]: down in the one milligram range of dosing
ability.
[SPEAKER_17]: And honestly, like my wife at one
milligram, she's like going to be
[SPEAKER_17]: uncomfortable soon.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is the delicate nature of people's
different endocannabinoid systems and the
[SPEAKER_17]: signaling systems.
[SPEAKER_17]: And how it interacts, it's just,
it's a delicate game that we're going to
[SPEAKER_17]: have to figure out over time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Murphy had her hand up.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to go to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't want to lose the train of
thought there on like, I always tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people I'm not a grower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm an extractor and it's not because
I don't know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a lot of stuff actually,
you know, well known for my aloe as you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have heard, but you know,
I always say I'm not a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the, the way that, you know,
growers have to approach problems is
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term, you know, I'm complaining about
the time it takes to run a GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes way longer to grow a new strain,
to Fino hunt something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: worth having.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really cool that people are
trying to cultivate the lower potency and
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver that flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also exactly the job that
everyone on this call is supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every single one of us could just get
the flavor out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's easy to blame the
consumer for focusing too much on THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but none of us sell our byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are out there buying cocoa
butter and winterizing under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: roof, throwing away waxes and buying waxes
and shipping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so much byproducts that we used to
promote cannabis and hemp for legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: and then forgot about when we started
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of us could be producing
those byproduct flavors from our,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, current supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we worked with hemp instead of
against it, you know, we could,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could deliver those, you know,
breeding experiences, but we could also
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where, you know,
if the market that doesn't want to get too
[SPEAKER_00]: high could dab, they'd be on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave everyone too high a potency in
order to get that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our fault.
We did.
[SPEAKER_17]: We did exactly what I did with the bubble
and teaching everyone to roll it all up
[SPEAKER_17]: wet and cause years of hot dabs and
nightmares.
[SPEAKER_17]: And also whatever the male macho bravado,
whatever that was, was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_17]: let's destroy them with a 900 degree half
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just like, oh my God, what were we
doing?
[SPEAKER_17]: Just putting ourselves back like 10,
15, 20 years, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the ability to create a proper,
you know, like for me, I've created it for
[SPEAKER_17]: myself.
[SPEAKER_17]: I give people dabs all the time.
[SPEAKER_17]: I give elderly people dabs that have never
dabbed like in their eighties and
[SPEAKER_17]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_17]: And what I do, and the only way I've been
able to do it because, and I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_17]: articulate, but even if the dabber is,
is even just like a titanium dabber,
[SPEAKER_17]: dabber like this, it's too big.
[SPEAKER_17]: You need a pin to pull a pin head out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you really at first, that little
pin drop is really about getting them over
[SPEAKER_17]: the fear of, and also you got to get rid
of the blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_17]: That blowtorch is, it's freaking people
out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody wants to see it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It scares people.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, shout out to companies like,
like Puffco and Carta and, and Dr. Dabber
[SPEAKER_17]: and Indux for creating products that allow
us to try these products, to try these
[SPEAKER_17]: extracts in the first place.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause you know, to make an extract like
that, and then just be like, what,
[SPEAKER_17]: how are you smoking it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm just going to roll it up in a
joint, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, Oh my God, like just stab me
through the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I always felt when I burn it in
a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's, that's, that's a herder one
too.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is what it is, but yeah,
it's a kind of lost my train of thought
[SPEAKER_17]: there, but Sam's got his hands waving.
[SPEAKER_17]: Please, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to mention that when we did the
analysis in 2000 with a team of subjects,
[SPEAKER_09]: we used a organoleptic survey with about a
hundred questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that might be interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing is that I do have one of
those induction pipes and I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_09]: that absolutely gives me the best taste of
any hits I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's only the first half of the
hits.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last half of the hits just tastes like
any other pipe.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's definitely for extracting the
flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a night, like to me,
it's an incredible tool for breeders.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to get to know your flavors
and you want to get to know your bouquets
[SPEAKER_17]: and how they sit on top of one another,
it's a, it's a rabbit hole that is well
[SPEAKER_17]: worth going down.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a tool that I'm personally
surprised hasn't been more, more tuned
[SPEAKER_17]: because you know, there's, there's amazing
machines, proton NMR and gas
[SPEAKER_17]: chromatograph, but there's also this thing
called the olfactory.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's quite an amazing piece of
equipment that really puts those other
[SPEAKER_17]: pieces of equipment borderline to shame.
[SPEAKER_17]: So use yours bioassay.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's valuable.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's definite value in bioassay and
sharing your experiences with people.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I love the science aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't necessarily treat it as much like
the word of God, because I also like the,
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, the personal experience of what the
person has gone through and, uh,
[SPEAKER_17]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so what you touched on is something
that is a problem that we deal with every
[SPEAKER_14]: single day in dispensaries is they come
across as concentrates and they're like,
[SPEAKER_14]: well, how do I use it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is still a huge learning curve for
somebody because I originally came to
[SPEAKER_14]: concentrates back in 2010 or so I already
using water hash, but I was seeing people
[SPEAKER_14]: buying BHO and other things and using it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was asking, well, why are you using
this?
[SPEAKER_14]: And Murphy, it is medically, you know,
it still is medically useful and people do
[SPEAKER_14]: use it as medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was watching older patients buying
these expensive little jars and those that
[SPEAKER_14]: knew how to, because originally people
were just dropping the hash butane oil
[SPEAKER_14]: onto a coal, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Once the coal had a burn-off, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the titanium swings came in and
then titanium, you know, you had the,
[SPEAKER_14]: the, the female and male, you know,
basically, uh, the steps in the direction
[SPEAKER_14]: of easier usage, but it hasn't been until
recently that there have been electronic
[SPEAKER_14]: entry points.
[SPEAKER_14]: But even then for somebody who's new to
concentrates, oh, now I have to buy
[SPEAKER_14]: something to use this because yes,
my, my torch scares living shit out of
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody every time I use it and they're
terrified, but now you've got things.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm using the denail heater, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is just a strictly convection heater
that heats my, you know, my, my,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, my tool exactly to how I want it,
but that's not an easy or cheap expense.
[SPEAKER_14]: So as you, your professionals here,
how do you teach people the most,
[SPEAKER_14]: an easiest entry point as opposed to,
you know, telling them to roll it into a
[SPEAKER_14]: snake is its own challenge and then
putting it into a joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck with that and crumbling it in,
they put too much in and then they're
[SPEAKER_14]: overdosing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how do you help people dip their toe
into the water?
[SPEAKER_19]: Puffco is usually the best way in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, Jessica's like, like, like,
you guys were saying before the torch
[SPEAKER_19]: scares the shit out of a lot of people,
but you can hand, you know, a puffco with
[SPEAKER_19]: the right amount of, of concentrating it
to, you know, uh, your girlfriend's dad
[SPEAKER_19]: and he can rip that and it's opens like a
whole new experience for him.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what I've seen personally,
at least.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fancy lights, you know,
that people are like, Ooh, what's that you
[SPEAKER_17]: got there?
[SPEAKER_17]: Old boy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just think, uh, it, it's definitely
an education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, we need to follow suit with other
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when I think about the
type of glass you're supposed to drink
[SPEAKER_00]: wine out of and the shape of it and the
length of it and the type of glass you're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to drink scotch out of,
you know, and so you can drink it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: literally whatever cup you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy a puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy an induction heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to stay plugged into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have like a little laser one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got one that I can dab with a
laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted by it, but like all of this
requires an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, however, for a medical product,
I think there's a good justification for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which is that if you want accurate
dosing, you need accurate temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's a lot to it when,
when we're dabbing, we're distilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the condensing arm on my
distillation unit is a different size,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different angle, a different
temperature, if the vacuum is operating at
[SPEAKER_00]: a different depth or CFM, you know,
I'm going to get a different separation
[SPEAKER_00]: and experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same would be true for the way
that you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could talk about it in that really
burdensome complicated way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like when I have a
chemistry question, I take it to Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first version is going to be too
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right after that gets out,
we get into the one that I could jump on
[SPEAKER_00]: board with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find a way to communicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To consumers, which might be as simple as
naming a couple of profiles in where they
[SPEAKER_00]: hit your nose versus your eyes versus the
back of your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or, you know, we, we approached them
with the, you know, the consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective because we could come up with
more innovative delivery methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the cart really took us by storm
because, you know, we let the tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: industry sort of infiltrate, you know,
it, and it, it didn't work out either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even affordable at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original vape pens were expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't believe it was going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never been more wrong about
anything in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working personally really
hard on infusing joints in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: works because pre-rolls are gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they don't have a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to improve them is to
fill them up with concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if I can use the right
type of concentrate to insulate the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and preserve the flavor, there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives me the portability and the
potency that a cart could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think back to this conversation
we've been having all along about potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we get away from trying to deliver the
most THC at a time, we could make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys remember the
little ceramic things that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: inject distill it into.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't the right solution,
but it was a direction that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, why didn't we deliver shatter in dab
sizes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did we make it in irregular sticky
shapes, wadded up in paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing ridiculous things sometimes
for slab dabs.
[SPEAKER_15]: You couldn't have had slab dabs.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you did that, even I was impressed with
slab dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've, uh, so, you know,
to that end, we, we don't make it easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to handle in the lab or for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require some investment,
but technology has never been cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are approaching dabs today,
it has never been more accessible because
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost for me to buy a titanium nail and
the blowtorch attachment for the big old
[SPEAKER_00]: map gas can at Home Depot is the same as
what it costs me for a $200 little laser
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I spent way, I don't want to know the
amount of money I invested in metal
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing things that I dabbed out of a lot
of times in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think people are willing
to make the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to make the argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, um, so I forget the name of the
overall company, but if you see like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a laser and, um, so you put a dab in
it, like you would with a puffco and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will create the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can get it really close,
but you can see.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got one of those for urban hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: See some type of device like that is sort
of key.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, obviously I think the oil
community is definitely grown.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like the customer base from the cart,
like people making carts has really like
[SPEAKER_17]: made oil spread and become very oil spread
pun intended.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, it's made it, uh, more mainstream.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like a lot of people have tried the carts.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now the question was from Etienne,
you know, what are you guys doing to sort
[SPEAKER_17]: of educate or to create your customer
base?
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're not liking the carts,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it's kind of, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely a way to fund your
company.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to do R and D and find other
pathways, if you can do nice carts and
[SPEAKER_17]: make them available, uh, people are always
going to love them.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, what I was going to say is though,
so what I did though Etienne from,
[SPEAKER_17]: from my brand in regards to education,
I do product knowledge sessions constantly
[SPEAKER_17]: with stores and bud tenders and people.
[SPEAKER_17]: But really before that, because I'm in the
same boat, I'm making like full melt
[SPEAKER_17]: bubble, six star dry sift live hash Ross.
[SPEAKER_17]: And these products are too strong for the
majority of the users.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I want to really kind of know
differently than how I helped build this
[SPEAKER_17]: crew of water extractors out in the world
by just selling bags to everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: Before that, there was no water hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there was no water hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, and so it's slowly built with great
growers become, if you know, finding the
[SPEAKER_17]: bags and building this industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I did with my brand, bubble man
brand is I knew that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: the majority of the industry in,
in both the U S and Canada are pre-rolled
[SPEAKER_17]: joints.
[SPEAKER_17]: That is like, that's like a massive,
if you can pull from the pre-rolled joint
[SPEAKER_17]: group market, that is like the,
one of the biggest market shares in
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I was like, I want those people to
experience a dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: However, they're not going to,
it's not like for many reasons that have
[SPEAKER_17]: already been mentioned on this panel.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just go buy a $500 puffco.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, uh, yeah, make sure you buy the
right rosin or bubble hash and,
[SPEAKER_17]: oh, you better get like a proper dabber.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you don't have a dabber.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you're going to need one.
[SPEAKER_17]: You won't be able, you won't be able to
get it out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_17]: And suddenly they're just like $18,000 in
they've got a JP Toro banger and a banger
[SPEAKER_17]: bucket and all a basket and all of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a lot of stuff to have.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I wanted to build a bridge with a
product that I could turn people on who
[SPEAKER_17]: are smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was now infused joints were just
coming when I created this product,
[SPEAKER_17]: but I, I created this little product
called the hash hits.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really like a simple little,
little box.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, you know, a little box with these
little paper tubes and we use ceramic
[SPEAKER_17]: bowls now, but we originally had stainless
steel bowls and we would just put like 0.2
[SPEAKER_17]: of a gram of hash in there and you'd get
like 10 rips out of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I was, when I was first creating
this product, like I was creating it for a
[SPEAKER_17]: customer base, I hadn't burned anything in
like over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had only vaporized hash Melty six-star
hash for like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: So imagine where my palette is when I'm
like, okay, I'm going to try and smoke
[SPEAKER_17]: some hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, the first bit I smoke, it was very,
I was just like, Oh my God, that was a
[SPEAKER_17]: little bit much.
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I got to know the product,
I'd take it out on the mountain and I'd
[SPEAKER_17]: give them away to people and I'd go
electric skateboarding around the seawall.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was this it was the first time in
decades that I had been stoned.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had just been high for 20 fucking years
and I totally had turned my back on the
[SPEAKER_17]: beauty of being stoned.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think for me, I discovered that
that's what I want to share with people.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to show them a nice stone that
doesn't come from cannabis, but is from
[SPEAKER_17]: the hash and build a little bridge for
them to kind of come on over and see,
[SPEAKER_17]: well, what else is over here?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you got these pure hash joints and you
got, Oh, you have some traditional hash
[SPEAKER_17]: and what's this stuff bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's the strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe just take a little bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And eventually, you know, just like for
me, I didn't start with live hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I started with like shitty moldy
weed, you know, from a sketchy dude that I
[SPEAKER_17]: probably shouldn't have been communicating
with when I was in a, in a junior high or
[SPEAKER_17]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I did with my brand,
build the bridge, create some products
[SPEAKER_17]: that they can kind of come over and visit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I would say to anyone that's on the
panel with oil, and Yari, before anyone
[SPEAKER_17]: answers my question, you can chime in
because you've had your hand up for a
[SPEAKER_17]: while, but I wonder, yeah, yeah,
I'll get to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wonder what you guys are doing in a
similar way to educate the people out
[SPEAKER_17]: there to what a great product,
you know, a BHO or a live resin or
[SPEAKER_17]: whatever it is that your SKUs are from the
solvent based community.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the best way to get into it?
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the best way to lead those,
you know, are you doing similar things,
[SPEAKER_17]: creating products that are easier to
access?
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Yari.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can answer that question when you're
done.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just going to chime in on the,
on the cart situation, because we talked
[SPEAKER_19]: about, you know, what an easy transition
it is for someone who's not used to
[SPEAKER_19]: concentrates or oils.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm not the hugest cart fan,
but they're a big necessity in everyday
[SPEAKER_19]: life, going to the airport, going on
trips, vacations where you can't get weed
[SPEAKER_19]: in between, in between zones.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just, they're, they're a good
thing to have.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now they've been dog shit for years.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think in the last like three or
four, some companies have really stepped
[SPEAKER_19]: it up and like done the research on our
type of oils burning in the carts,
[SPEAKER_19]: because for I don't even know how many
years it was just China sending us e-cig
[SPEAKER_19]: carts and that we were just testing to see
what was best.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the fact that they have no burn
technology where the heat ramps up on and
[SPEAKER_19]: off when you're pulling a draw makes that
really easy for people to not be holding
[SPEAKER_19]: buttons and over burning the oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the tech has got better.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that transition to people that
don't have dab rigs yet, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: they're running around town and they can't
have like a whole thing with them,
[SPEAKER_19]: that that is like the good transition for
a lot of these people getting into.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're popular.
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely like people ask me,
what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_17]: What's your favorite dude?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like if sure there's your favorite,
but how about like, what are you willing
[SPEAKER_17]: not to smoke out of if you need to get
high and you don't have any device at that
[SPEAKER_17]: point in time?
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, listen, like I probably won't hit
the Coke can, but I'm definitely making an
[SPEAKER_17]: apple pipe.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like 100%.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's no problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll make a pipe out of, out of a piece of
fruit all day long.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's something to be said for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing we used to do at Incredibles,
we, we had done like distillations,
[SPEAKER_13]: like call it, you know, we terpene
distillations, but just sort of like a
[SPEAKER_13]: distillation of the volatiles until we,
we decided it was a good cutoff just sort
[SPEAKER_13]: of a single pass cut and coming up with
some pretty like really pretty good oils.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we would do essentially like essential
oil events paired with like industry
[SPEAKER_13]: events where we would have a room and we'd
put it in some bowl.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would spread out a little, little bit
of our distilled terpenes into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, pass that around the
room and give like a whole education class
[SPEAKER_13]: on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know it's not something that you can
do all the time, but it's like a
[SPEAKER_13]: non-smoked entry into it too, where you
don't even have to like, they don't even
[SPEAKER_13]: have to necessarily ingest it,
but they can still get an experience and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything and start learning about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It gets them sometimes over a little fear.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what the micro dab always did.
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if they didn't get high, they tasted
it a little bit and it got them over the
[SPEAKER_17]: fear of like, okay, like I did it because
they're right to be fearful.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, dude, I could give you a dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be an absolutely nightmare.
[SPEAKER_17]: Terrible experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: You would not want to be here or in your
body for that matter.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's just best to avoid that at
sort of all costs.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, if anyone has any answer to that
question in regards to, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: things you're doing, not just to educate,
you know, your customer base and to feed
[SPEAKER_17]: your customer base, but to also educate
new people who are enjoying like
[SPEAKER_17]: pre-rolled joints right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe, you know, maybe they might have
a better experience if they knew about,
[SPEAKER_17]: about x-rays.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I think that the solvent less
community has done, you know, really well
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison to the solvent based
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, a lot of reasons
for it, you know, and probably just the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the age of the processes,
how new some of the things we do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent world are is that, you know,
there is a big detachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about it a few times between
what happens in the lab and what happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consumer doesn't really need to
understand the entirety of the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do think there's a ton of value in
showing your lab, showing the process and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving that visual representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for someone to understand the
temperature of decarboxylation or what
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation is, or why it happens at a
specific temperature is unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them to still see rosin drip out of a
press and look at the color and smell it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room and say, this is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can give consumers that kind of
level of understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we show our facilities and show our
process a lot more, and rather than trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to describe why it's better, literally
show up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come to this a little more naturally
because I've worked so much on the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been training people to operate
equipment for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very normal for me to have other
people in the lab with me and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: showing pictures and videos of the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the secrecy and the intellectual
property of it all and the nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: operating with butane and propane,
you know, there's a lot of business
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons why people don't want a camera in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the marketing team could show real
stuff happening, you know, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: my job is lifting a jar and looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that a lot, but there's better
content that we could have consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for consumers to see the
freezer storage nicely packed and
[SPEAKER_00]: organized and start promoting some trends
like that where people show their
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a grow gets to show the healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who's washing is showing this ice
water, showing the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to flex the visual images of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get people closer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if people could feel a little
bit more connected to the process with
[SPEAKER_00]: that information, they don't even have to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just would have some concept of why
CO2 isn't butane, even if all they know is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it looks different when it comes out
of the machine, because they've seen what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like when it comes out of the
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of these visual
cues that we all talk about and know
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the consumer just hasn't been able to
see from us in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I do a lot of that
in just showing the lab, which goes a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way to build trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like having an open kitchen
in a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can see what's happening and
it builds trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love an open kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No source.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love an open kitchen.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also am terrified of an open
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a good confidence to have when you go
to an open kitchen.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I've one time in my life, I was at a
place that had a beautiful open kitchen
[SPEAKER_17]: that I'd eaten there many times.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just right before my food came out,
I saw one of the people working back there
[SPEAKER_17]: do something that was just not something I
wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it completely robbed me of my
appetite.
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't eat the food.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't really want to tell everyone
else at the table, like, oh, don't eat
[SPEAKER_17]: that food, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, don't eat that food.
[SPEAKER_17]: That guy that just touched it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I'm telling you, don't eat that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do love the transparency.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's why, personally, for LiveHashRosin,
when I'm buying it, I would love to see a
[SPEAKER_17]: small sample.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to see a picture or something.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would be great.
[SPEAKER_17]: You buy a gram of LiveHashRosin and you
get like a gram of the bubble that made
[SPEAKER_17]: it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can really get an idea because,
you know, the sensory input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the flower it came from too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, at that point, it's right,
you know, why not be a pretty good thing
[SPEAKER_17]: for certain.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's awesome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a pretty good conversation here.
[SPEAKER_17]: We still got a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have about 14 minutes to go.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, we can kind of, I do want,
well, I have you guys all here as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you guys can reply back to that email
with your Instagrams and contact
[SPEAKER_17]: information, I want to put it into the
description of the video because there's
[SPEAKER_17]: tons of people in the chat that want to
reach out to each of you.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be really wonderful if I
didn't have to kind of chase you guys
[SPEAKER_17]: around and you could do that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, yeah, another 14 minutes.
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely want to thank our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the first HashChurch in 11 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've said no to sponsors for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's also kind of wild and neat and
ironic that, you know, some of my first
[SPEAKER_17]: sponsors are for the solvent world,
including Adam at Evolved Extraction
[SPEAKER_17]: Solutions.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I got your name right, Adam.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can check him out over at Evolved
Extraction.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, I'm going to put everyone's
contact information that they are willing
[SPEAKER_17]: to share, of course.
[SPEAKER_17]: Instagram is usually a main one.
[SPEAKER_17]: Email probably won't be putting phone
numbers, but certainly emails.
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you to Adam and Evolved for
sponsoring today, as well as the
[SPEAKER_17]: MediaBros, of which Adam is their
distributor here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_17]: So they made sure to say, if you guys
wanted to get a sample or a discount of
[SPEAKER_17]: 15%, you can reach out to the MediaBros
dot store.
[SPEAKER_17]: Use the code HashChurch, capital M,
capital B, and you get either a free
[SPEAKER_17]: sample there from those guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you MediaBros for supporting
HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you to my friend Jorge from
Chemtech.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can check them out at mychemtech.com.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just like I said, some of the nicest
diamonds I've ever seen was from the homie
[SPEAKER_17]: Jorge in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome that you're out there doing that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, of course, I got to thank my
friends Mark and Dennis from the Kraft
[SPEAKER_17]: Greenery.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a local dispensary here in town,
and they're sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: they've just got a good consciousness.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're really into finding good variety
and good cultivars.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, I've got some favorite rosins
that I get over from them.
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything else anyone wants to cover in the
10 minutes, 11 minutes that we have left?
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, really, before we get to that,
thank you guys for being an awesome panel.
[SPEAKER_17]: What a great group of people that Mark
Sheldone has brought together.
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely want to thank you guys for
being here.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to stay in touch with you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want this to be the solvent
episode.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want it to be the first of many parted
solvent episodes.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're definitely going to get you guys
back and get deep into these
[SPEAKER_17]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_17]: But in the meantime, if anyone has
anything they want to share before we sign
[SPEAKER_17]: out, it's been almost four hours of
HashChurch on a lovely Sunday morning
[SPEAKER_17]: here, I guess afternoon now in British
Columbia on the West Coast, just
[SPEAKER_17]: overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's bluebird day.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sunny.
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of makes me want to like drive up to
Whistler and smash.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's no powder up there right
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of East Coast, icy, nasty,
terrible conditions, but it's still epic
[SPEAKER_17]: and awesome to be up there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whistler is rough right now, but we're
doing what we can with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Adam and I are going to be up there next
weekend and we're going to be smashing the
[SPEAKER_17]: ice mounds.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, Adam?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we get some snow between now and
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a system in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: No way after this.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you know, shout out to Wade.
[SPEAKER_17]: He must be having a rough day.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that he will always make it to
HashChurch if and when he can.
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly shared the the link with him
because I always love really I can finish
[SPEAKER_17]: it off, but no one can finish off an
episode like HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_17]: I always like have inter like I'm looking
inside my being.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to become a better person.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just like Wade literally touches my
heart and soul every time he speaks.
[SPEAKER_17]: We love Wade and just have a deep respect
for everything he's done.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, what a what a soldier like just
giving medicine away to catastrophic
[SPEAKER_17]: children.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I hope I hope I hope we can do maybe
a little video together where you guys are
[SPEAKER_17]: like, you know, at least hear your voices
in the same room.
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Also wanted to mention what else did I?
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I wanted to mention that Jorge had his
hand up and what did you have to say
[SPEAKER_17]: there, my friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to touch base a little bit
on like the solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we didn't cover the like what
solvent do you like to extract with?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you know, isobutane,
propane and n-butane all behave a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different in the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pull more turps, a little more fat,
some more color and they each pull a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a different flavor,
you know, like from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to get like some feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: From everyone possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I love this.
[SPEAKER_17]: This this is going to be first.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to let Murphy and maybe a few
others of you guys just give a cliff note
[SPEAKER_17]: answer.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think this will be the conversation
to start the next solvent episode on.
[SPEAKER_17]: What a great question, Jorge.
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Murphy.
[SPEAKER_17]: You put your hand up first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's so many reasons to
choose each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one in our industry specifically
because it's so young and new that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: all get really hung up on because the
first question you have to ask yourself is
[SPEAKER_00]: about your equipment and what it's capable
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes the best solvent for a
specific SOP is not going to be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent for the underpowered heater and,
you know, low wattage chiller that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to, you know, run that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to think about,
you know, at the at the cost of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment you have and at the cost of the
scale that you want to perform at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also in the way that you can
choose a best solvent, you can compromise
[SPEAKER_00]: in a really strategic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, because you have lower
pressure vessels, you go colder and longer
[SPEAKER_00]: with butane and you, you know,
change your surface area and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accordingly, and so, you know,
as important as it is to choose your
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent, you really have to choose your
equipment with your solvent in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and in traditional chemistry,
it's not, you know, unusual to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different piece of glassware if
you change your solvent in order for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to match an SOP or you change your SOP to
use the same glassware.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, we sometimes try to do
everything with the same two columns and
[SPEAKER_00]: hope for the best, which is not even you
know, go back to repeatability as you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best solvent is the one you can repeat
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't repeat a process,
none of it is best and the solvent is the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned earlier Indra was
the one of the first to bring up this gas
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't learned that lesson and we
haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using refill cylinders which are
designed for fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need to be having direct fill
tanks that are stored on site,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe buried underground if
you're in a tornado area or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we need to we need an entirely
different process to facilitate what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times we get real hung up on
what product we want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best solvent for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't start with what is the best
solvent for the process that we're capable
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've already bought equipment or want
to pursue like that, that question can put
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a real circle if you're not careful
and a lot of times people will get bad
[SPEAKER_00]: results from a specific solvent because of
those ancillary features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a very integrated question
that you probably need to ask every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: every batch until you have incredible
repeatability.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely two dimensional.
[SPEAKER_17]: You definitely answered it from that sort
of corporate business owner perspective of
[SPEAKER_17]: like, well, listen, that's not I feel like
Jorge asked it more like, yo, what do you
[SPEAKER_17]: guys like for your best solvent like for
your head?
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't know, we'll let him answer
that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But first, John, you had your hand up
first, then Jorge, Jorge, and then Yari,
[SPEAKER_17]: you'll be up after that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we'll call it a day.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's OK if we go over five or 10 or 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_17]: So go ahead, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I think definitely a good
place to start another episode on because
[SPEAKER_03]: we could go pretty deep into the various
reasons you might choose neat ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isobutane, neat propane blends with normal
butane or whatever, because although
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all non-polar solvents,
they're all alkanes, they did pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: different things in terms of dissolving
different flavoring as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed that with just straight
intanes, certain flavors don't get picked
[SPEAKER_03]: up almost at a wide range of temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isobutane, I guess it's the bond angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark could come in and explain that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe more capable of pulling some more
polar flavorants out of the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody knows that propane does a
great job with terpenes as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot there, not to mention
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the original reason I had my hand up
was just to give a shout out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: solventless community because I have
became a better hash maker from learning
[SPEAKER_03]: the things and following the solventless
community as they are having to look so
[SPEAKER_03]: closely at all these different trichomes,
characteristics, morphology.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has educated me to be able to select
the style of extraction for a given
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gets into solvent selection as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: Jorge, I think you were next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the question was basically like
Murphy got it like, I wanted to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you guys use different
solvents for different purposes based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I want to mention like one
time I was testing how much THCA each
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent can dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I loaded up a miner, you know,
two miners with the same amount of isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: and injected, same amount of solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was isobutane, one was n-butane,
and heated them up to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that only isobutane can only
dissolve about half the amount that
[SPEAKER_01]: n-butane can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why like your SOP would,
I guess, matter for what you're after to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, too, like what you were
saying is, yes, there is also like to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract with, like, for example,
you can get away with using a blend like
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% 30 being 70 butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can bring benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, it can help pull a lot of the
other compounds with the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a more full profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can also help with like recovery
times because it boils over a lot faster
[SPEAKER_01]: than butane.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yari, you had your hand up.
[SPEAKER_19]: In my personal opinion, in doing all the
experiments with the grows and the flour
[SPEAKER_19]: and everything, n-butane is the best
solvent.
[SPEAKER_19]: For weed, in my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that they explain all those other
reasons if you wouldn't get really like
[SPEAKER_19]: analytical with it, but all around the
effect, the HT that comes off of it,
[SPEAKER_19]: the THCA that you pull from it,
I personally think n-butane is the way to
[SPEAKER_19]: go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run neat, normal butane mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do envision this like super nitty
gritty future of like, oh, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: this variety has this flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for this extraction, I'm gonna dial
this blend of co-solvents to make sure I
[SPEAKER_03]: honor that bouquet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wish I was running living soil,
top shelf every day.
[SPEAKER_16]: You gotta make it happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell it, you had your hand up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I've also run NDT.
[SPEAKER_13]: N-butane to keep it simple on the recovery
too, to ensure that like I'm not having to
[SPEAKER_13]: do crazy math to try to get my ratios back
to what I wanted after recovering.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's part of the reason why at
Incredibles as a business, we always kept
[SPEAKER_13]: it n-butane just to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were always recovering just one gas
and the ratio of gas has never changed in
[SPEAKER_13]: our recovery tanks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just sort of out of preference,
I guess too over time, probably a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bit biased in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna have to beg everybody,
cause I love propane so much, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to run it such high
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running low pressure propane,
you ain't doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're willing to blast it,
like really blast it, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything that CO2 should be able to
do, but doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's actually kind of similar to CO2
in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of the chemical ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a tetrahedral type freedom of
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I like to compare propane to
like, that's like riding a bucking bull.
[SPEAKER_03]: And n-tane is like riding a good
well-trained horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it depends on his driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you're saying, for the business
sense, I think n-tane is more popular for
[SPEAKER_03]: many reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them being it's really nice to
handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propane is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that was an incredible conversation,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, thank you for coming on today and
just dropping the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, first of many episodes,
we're definitely gonna go deeper.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna hear more from both Jorge and Adam
and Murphy in regards to the education
[SPEAKER_17]: that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to see a little bit, talk a
little bit about the genome project that
[SPEAKER_17]: you have.
[SPEAKER_17]: Going on there with your education.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just, yeah, I'd love to obviously
speak to all of you again here in the very
[SPEAKER_17]: near future.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Dr. Mark, thank you so much for
bringing this great group of people
[SPEAKER_17]: together.
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully you guys had a good time
over there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Puffing bulls and ripping dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was really cool about pulling this
group together is it brought back some
[SPEAKER_06]: relationships like Eric and I haven't seen
each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been such a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so good to reconnect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's great to hear from
some of the younger folks in the room too,
[SPEAKER_06]: because yeah, there are some OGs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have an invitation out to Boris at
Busy V and Jason at Nemotech.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, but hey, we got kind Bill in
the room here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is a great community of
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan and Max, you know, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did consider, you know, basically
throwing maybe an invite out to Derek.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think having Ryan and Telly here are
the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, Marcus, thank you so much for
giving us this opportunity to come
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Murphy, you're always so impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could always tell you that everything
that you say is spot on chemical.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, chemically correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the real difference between
propane and butane has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: the polarity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Polarity is about the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the with the
thermodynamics, has to do with the rate of
[SPEAKER_06]: recovery and the fact that, you know,
it's a lot easier and quicker to recover
[SPEAKER_06]: things like butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Jorge, thank you so much for sharing
that result, that result about the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that isopropane dissolved less than then
propane, you know, you want to mention
[SPEAKER_01]: real quick, the Terps also play a role
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about just clean iso,
you know, no, no secondary solvent.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just side by side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, just to be able to do a side
by side comparison and share that result
[SPEAKER_06]: with the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I envisioned as soon as you
said that result.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jorge, I don't know if you remember,
I came by your booth at BizCon and we had
[SPEAKER_06]: a really we had a really nice chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a really, really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and I'll say the same thing I said to
to to Murphy, which is that everything
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're saying is spot on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're you're not a chemist by
training, but you're kind of a chemist by
[SPEAKER_06]: observation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that's really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But sharing that result again,
maybe that's a great way to do a control
[SPEAKER_06]: crash.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the fact that you can take
advantage of different solubility
[SPEAKER_06]: differences and these different solvents,
there could be ways of perhaps,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like if you wanted to make like
kind of like the micro diamonds or if you
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to sort of speed up your process,
you could keep that in mind that,
[SPEAKER_06]: hey, if we're rich in in isopropane,
we might see a crash happen sooner than
[SPEAKER_06]: later, sooner than we predicted.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we develop the the genome
crystallizer, that's actually the original
[SPEAKER_04]: insight that drove that innovation was
noticing that if you added cold propane
[SPEAKER_04]: into like a jar of dissolved oil and oil
dissolved in butane, then it would like
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately kind of like pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that observation kind of just we kept
at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we actually use butane because
like people were mentioning like it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit easier to control and kind of
the consistency and repeatability of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's a challenging
crystallization, you can always add it
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds like isobutane would have a similar
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But adding very cold propane into the
mixture can drop the the solubility and
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like create like an instant
cascade of crystallization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Mark, you're saying there's not
much difference in polarity between these
[SPEAKER_03]: three white hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jorge has shown us, you know, with pure
PHA, a clear solubility difference than a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of us have seen it between the three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with the genome crystallizer,
I've also wondered, you know, is it acting
[SPEAKER_03]: as an anti-solvent or a direct contact
refrigerant?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what keeping me
involved with, you know, playing with all
[SPEAKER_03]: these things is there's a lot of questions
to be answered out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we know what works, but
sometimes the how gets into the nitty
[SPEAKER_03]: gritty.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we did it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We hit our four hour mark, four hours and
six minutes, in fact.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to definitely I've got all of
your email contacts, but I definitely love
[SPEAKER_17]: for you guys to reply to the email or hit
me up in any way that you can,
[SPEAKER_17]: ideally through that email.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll also put you in touch with anyone if
there's an email.
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's someone you don't know,
but you wanted to know, but maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_17]: their name or the email doesn't really
connect to them in any way, you can reach
[SPEAKER_17]: out to me and I'll make sure to connect
anyone on the panel here today who wants
[SPEAKER_17]: to have the link and just really thank,
you know, the four hundred plus people
[SPEAKER_17]: that were watching the entire time we had
this episode.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some hardcore cannabis nerds that
just love to hear this stuff and we love
[SPEAKER_17]: to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a it's a marriage made in heaven,
really.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not dead, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not dead.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's right here today.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Hashchurch episode three.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll be talking about this some more
in the future.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully we'll make a bunch of wonderful
new programs here.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's hard to plan a show.
[SPEAKER_17]: So once again, I got to give you props,
Dr. Mark, for pulling such an eclectic,
[SPEAKER_17]: wonderful group of people that actually
answered the emails.
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually, it's hard when you're
planning a show and the people you're
[SPEAKER_17]: reaching out to.
[SPEAKER_17]: Aren't getting back to you.
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully next week we have another
doozy.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure exactly what it's going to
be, but I'm sure it'll be a banger and
[SPEAKER_17]: it'll start coming together here sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the meantime, I would say may the full
melt bless your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_17]: And thanks, everyone, for the time that
you spent with us here today on
[SPEAKER_17]: Hashchurch.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is infinite.
[SPEAKER_17]: This will just be up forever and ever and
ever or at least a long time.
[SPEAKER_17]: So peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll talk to you next time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's it.
