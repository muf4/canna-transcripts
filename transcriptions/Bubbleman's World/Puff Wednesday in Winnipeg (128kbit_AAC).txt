[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to... Bubble Man's Room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am visiting my family in Manitoba,
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually the room that I grew
up in from around 12 years to around 16,
[SPEAKER_07]: 17 before I moved out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, this is my little room.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not much to see really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll kind of give you guys a little tour
once we have a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I thought would be cool was to do
a little dab in Bubble Man's Room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got my dabs right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a little headband left over
still.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably scoop up a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When the rosin is the right texture it
just cleans up so perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, this is literally the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I lived in when I started smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, today, not that it's that
exciting, but it's part of my history,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking of taking us down just down
the street where I smoked my first joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought that would be kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the meantime, I've got the
mothership, the gold D-nail, and we are
[SPEAKER_07]: ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Headband, rosin dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: First dab I've ever taken in my room,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from maybe some hot knives,
that I did years ago in my closet here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't smoke very often in this room
because it's on the same floor as my
[SPEAKER_07]: parents.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be pretty easy to get caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my mom's down by the pool right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully she doesn't come up and catch
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, Bubble Man doing bubble dabs
in the bubble room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rosin bubble dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Window tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always good to blow your head out the
window even though it's all blowing back
[SPEAKER_07]: in.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're puffing at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: People ask me how I got into this.
[SPEAKER_07]: How I found my passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really happened in this area.
[SPEAKER_07]: In this home, another home that I used to
live in with my father and his wife,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as my stepsister and my
stepbrother.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to live just down the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to get you guys over there as
well because that's really where it
[SPEAKER_07]: started as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the back, puffing joints, in the back
little shed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always had a blast there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And always got away with a little more.
[SPEAKER_07]: As many of you guys who come from divorced
families know, when the family gets
[SPEAKER_07]: divorced, you usually, especially if
you're a teenage boy, you can get away
[SPEAKER_07]: with some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get away with some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking with my stepsister the other
day about having plants growing at my old
[SPEAKER_07]: man's house back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was a little bit crazy to say the
least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, secondary dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show you guys out the window real
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it's that exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to make this video a little bit
like puffing around the peg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's what we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Puffing around the peg.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started here for Bubble Man at this
home when I was about 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoked my first joint down the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I really never looked back after
that, did I?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's give you guys the huge tour
of this amazing bedroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I've even got my old skateboard
painting still up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is where, you know, the early
days were formed for the Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just out the old street.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a stop sign right in front.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we always had mad action in front of
this house.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always cars non-stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually three stop signs out in
front of this house.
[SPEAKER_07]: But enough of the stop signs out in front
of my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will see you very soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suspect the next time we light this
camera up, we're going to be where the
[SPEAKER_07]: Bubble Man smoked his very first joint
ever here in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_07]: So stay tuned for that and catch you guys
in a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in a unique place right now that I
have not been in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the very location right here by
this BFI can, this big garbage can,
[SPEAKER_07]: that I smoked my first cannabis joint ever
in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought it would be kind of a neat
thing to come back here, get the
[SPEAKER_07]: mothership all loaded up and do a little
bit of a torch rip on some bubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's quite, quite a few people.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's trucks over here that are working
and there's a bunch of people over here
[SPEAKER_07]: that are working.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am behind some stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bibles for Missions over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we've got a hair salon over
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just figured let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have a rip in the spot where I
literally had my first rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting to see if we get
some people looking to see what I am
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But first time I ever smoked herb,
I was 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was with my good buddy Steve McEvoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was where we smoked, right by
this can in fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where I'm gonna smoke today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm gonna smoke today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've already got people watching me.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we got bubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So first things first, let's have a little
rip-a-dip.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting to see what these
people think I'm doing back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm sure people don't regularly
come back here to smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: The city has dispensaries and other types
of lounges that you can go and actually
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoy your cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're not forced, like I was as a
kid, to come to the back of an industrial
[SPEAKER_07]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: And smoke next to a garbage can.
[SPEAKER_07]: But alas, it is part of my history.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to share it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are going to share it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Torch is very low right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a backup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That torch was completely out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But luckily,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a backup.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always good to have a backup when
you're looking to have a blaze session in
[SPEAKER_07]: the first place you've ever smoked in your
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got cars coming back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna get this dabbed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people probably have no clue what the
hell it is I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I prefer it that way, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just doing a little cleaning
behind me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably the first time I've had a puff at
this location since I was 14 years old
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking my first joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know it's not very exciting,
but I figured I wanted to share it with
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess there it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have smoked at Bubble Man's first spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now at the inn at the Forks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's like a four-star
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a four-star hotel.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pretty nice little spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm no longer at my mom's place over in
the east of Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm here on the edge of St. Boniface.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, if you can see in the
background, there's a big large building
[SPEAKER_07]: with four posts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the left of it, there is a cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the hospital that I was born on.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very cool little area,
the Forks, all sorts of little shops.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got the Children's Museum right
across the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And tons of beautiful places to go dab
outside, which I'm going to go do after
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I figured we would start it off with a
dab inside the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already done a few of these,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Hash Church today, which was a nice
church.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit slower than usual.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone was kind of in a party sort of
space with Chalice last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't have quite the amount of
people that normally come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still a great panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still some great discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I look forward to next week's
Hash Church for sure, where we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: continue the Hash discussion, continue the
discussion on rosin, the efficacy and the
[SPEAKER_07]: safety of pressing in screens,
if there's any chemicals releasing,
[SPEAKER_07]: if there are plant foods that are left
behind in that plant matter, and then
[SPEAKER_07]: rosin and how is that affecting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had all these different discussions
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you watched Hash Church, it was pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, I'm going to bump into maybe
one or two people locally here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also love the idea of going to Vapes on
Main.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just on Main Street, which is just
right behind me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe even tonight, I can head down there
and maybe see the guys, do a little
[SPEAKER_07]: interview, talk about what it's like
having the only vapor lounge in Manitoba,
[SPEAKER_07]: in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, share some dabs with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my D-nail is just about up to temp.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at 570 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got it set today at 720.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, what I was talking about in Hash
Church, I've lowered it from my normal 750
[SPEAKER_07]: to 720, and I dropped it right below 600.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually at 615 right now,
and that's where we're going to hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let that quartz get a little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always nice to have patience for the dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have patience for your dabs, people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I've been here in Manitoba for
about a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a lot of bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely a lot of bugs in
Manitoba, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even thinking about going up by the river
tonight, I think, you know, if the sun
[SPEAKER_07]: goes down, which I hope, because it's
about 34 degrees Celsius out there,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be 90, 90-something degrees,
85, 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely warm.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beauty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that rosin dab's going to get me
going.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for some butane to get into
the Big Shot GTA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we're going to have to go
Manitoba-style and rock the giant propane
[SPEAKER_07]: tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go outside and we'll go hit some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the new titanium banger,
so I think I'm going to bring that with me
[SPEAKER_07]: this time and leave the quartz at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I'm going to bring you guys
with me, so why don't we head out there
[SPEAKER_07]: and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just standing out in front of my hotel
room here, and I figured we'd check out
[SPEAKER_07]: the river for the start of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a little bit of a wake and bake down by
the water, Winnipeg styles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then later on today, we're going to
hopefully hook up with my buddy Al and
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe go by Vapes on Main, which is the
new vaporizer lounge here in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I have time, I'll also go by the
dispensary and check out what they've got
[SPEAKER_07]: going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, this is the city that it all
started for me, so it's kind of exciting,
[SPEAKER_07]: even though it may seem a little boring to
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go puff a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big shoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess this is the Celebration Circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool how they have words
carved into the North Portage Partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go take a rip right in the
middle of this circle for everyone to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is the Celebration Circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: River's just over the bank there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll hit a bowl in the Celebration
Circle in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start off by the river.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like a good plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bridge over troubled water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking for that morning wake and bake
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the St. Boniface Hospital
across the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm here on the bridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got the mothership out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got the torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess really turn on this torch and
see what we can't get done here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a very open public place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But from what I've heard, a license is a
license.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as long as you're within reason,
not in a super duper public place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm on a bridge right now with nobody.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think they would allow me to get away
with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess the only real way you know in
this day and age is when the police come
[SPEAKER_07]: up to you and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's on the bridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take a rip up here,
and then we're going to head down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And take a rip right on the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just show you guys that there's lots
of great spots in Winnipeg for puffing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to show you guys a couple of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already been here for over a week and
haven't really shown you guys anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got my dab of rosin right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dab doodles.
[SPEAKER_07]: A case.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be good to see a couple of my buddies
today, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some old school friends that I haven't
seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still warm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice and clean though.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I'm using that new deep dish
titanium banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to say, I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably the titanium nail that I
like the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Decent bridge toke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say we head down by the river,
right through the edge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a couple of rifts down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't you guys join me?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, getting her lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this titanium heated up.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and finally going to get that
dab by the river.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez, we waited for a while for that one,
didn't we?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's to not offending people and
still medicating in public.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think today is going to be a very good
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have talked to my good friend,
Reggie the Roddy, who I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys remember him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was an old school friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Old school guy that was on True Stoners
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on True Stoners back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I originally met him,
but he was from the same city as me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I eventually ended up meeting him in
person years ago, 12 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would have seen him on the recent
degenerate art videos that I released.
[SPEAKER_07]: The backstage footage, the sort of behind
the scene interviews that never made it
[SPEAKER_07]: into the actual documentary.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, and you'll recognize Reggie the
Roddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully he's going to give us a
little tour of the city today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe some dispensaries, Vaped on Main,
and potentially go to a really nice grow
[SPEAKER_07]: of a friend of his.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we'll stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really nicely medicated after a couple
of raws and dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to walk this river a little
bit and we'll catch up with you guys in a
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, I just hooked up with Reggie the
Roddy here at the Forks in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, super good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been, like I said, I've known
Reggie for, it has to be over 12 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 to 15 or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: True Stoners and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was finally telling me about this
building in the background that I was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, what is this building that you guys
have?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never, so tell us again, this is the
Human Rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Human Rights Museum in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they spent about $350 million on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I just read in the paper,
hardly anybody goes to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, for $350 million, you think that you
could probably really forward the human
[SPEAKER_07]: rights movement by actually helping people
whose human rights are being violated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you would think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's our plan today, dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are you going to, you have a little
idea of what we're going to do here today
[SPEAKER_07]: in Winnipeg?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a bit of cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few lounges in Winnipeg now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dispensary just officially opened on
the first and there's a couple others that
[SPEAKER_05]: are half open type of a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know where they all are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll stop by them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got, I've got an old friend of mine
who, if he's home, has got a lovely canvas
[SPEAKER_05]: in his basement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll have some fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get the journey started so we can
get dabbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's low key, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He played my axe, he says.
[SPEAKER_06]: How bad of a guy could he be, he says.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is Osborne Village here now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, it looks so different to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean girl Bob, right in the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean girl still here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: He changed corners.
[SPEAKER_05]: He used to be on the outside corner and
now he's on the other side corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so right here, where Ron's place was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right across the street there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The launderman.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we just set up a little
photo shoot here with a few little plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the GPP, Gary's Paw Plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gary's Paw Plant, very popular strain here
in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a couple of nice glass pipes set up on
the table here for a little photo shoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thought we would share.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you got?
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is the Pyrology.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Pyrology Recycler.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you really like that one you were
saying, eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got great ratings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It rips.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a Mothership Fab Egg in the middle
with the Buddha in the background.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've got, looks like salt in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that Merk?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Merk Ruer Colab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really quite cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw them in a can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rurtec?
[SPEAKER_05]: That thing just gobbles dabs too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're going to hit them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shall we start our adventure?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get that little Recycler in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, boom, shaboom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.
No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tasty Flower Rosins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright guys, so we're back in the car
here heading to, are we heading to Vapes
[SPEAKER_07]: on Main?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Old Vapes on Main.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the first open cannabis dispensary
in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's medicinal marijuana headquarters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: First real dispensary in Winnipeg though?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and our friend Bill, Bill
Vandegraaff is going to be meeting us down
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us a little bit about Bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill is a retired Winnipeg police force,
I think a 30-year veteran of the Winnipeg
[SPEAKER_05]: police force.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an outspoken member of LEAP,
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill has been arrested for growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He used to supply himself, his father,
his daughter with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: His dad had ALS.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Bill is PTSD, I'm not positive,
and I forget his daughter's ailment,
[SPEAKER_05]: but she has something nasty as well.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really stepping out, really stepping
out from what he knows, 30 years on the
[SPEAKER_07]: police force to become sort of a,
well I guess not sort of, but really a
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well he's heavy, especially I'm sure
getting busted was a big part of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but although he very well may have
supported LEAP before that, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well it'll be interesting to get a couple
questions to Bill and see where his head's
[SPEAKER_07]: at now today, how the rest of the police
force look at him today, the new guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: the old guys, and just find out if the air
is changing here in the center of Canada
[SPEAKER_07]: in the prairies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the questions we're going to ask
Bill, and we're going to head down to that
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary right now, so we'll see you
guys when we get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just on Main Street, there's the Fort
Gary Hotel over on the left.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Forks, where I'm staying, just on the
other side of this building.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess that's really the big
city center right there, hey, with the
[SPEAKER_07]: Richardson building and the... Port of
Germain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Port of Germain, 40 below.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody come down and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't try to force.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can definitely see the influence of
the Ukrainian culture here in Manitoba
[SPEAKER_07]: with a church like that, hey?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Russian-esque.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make a great grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we're just here at the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that they've got a nice big...
They're definitely obviously there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to do this, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check out Winnipeg's first dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so proud of Winnipeg for pulling this
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, it was over 20 years ago
that we did the hemp activism that led to
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis hemp being grown legally here for
the first time in over 73 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that hemp's been growing nonstop ever
since, so hopefully we can get the herbs
[SPEAKER_07]: going as well and make sure that that
never stops as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's head in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely love how pronounced their
sign is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's them, guys, if you want to give
them a call.
[SPEAKER_07]: 204-586-4899.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're watching Bubble Man's World,
I'm going to give you an honest review of
[SPEAKER_07]: this place and the people here,
and I have a feeling that they're really
[SPEAKER_07]: good people, so let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's just get set up, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, no, let's check this place out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Crackers open.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we have a doctor willing to help
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a volunteer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Winpeg's first dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I'm so impressed that you guys are
pushing the envelope, pushing the
[SPEAKER_07]: boundaries, and, you know, making the
steps that are necessary to allow people
[SPEAKER_07]: that currently are being, say,
let down by the current licensed
[SPEAKER_07]: production facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm not blaming the licensed
producers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have their hands tied so tightly that
they're unable to make extracts,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're unable to produce edibles,
and I'm sure that you know as well as I do
[SPEAKER_07]: that the best way to use cannabis as a
medicine isn't always to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extract form is very helpful in
medicinal ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current regulations don't allow total
freedom of human rights and therefore it
[SPEAKER_01]: is our right to decide what we put in our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's face it, one can actually
debate that the draconian law,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Narcotics Act from 1923 was introduced
because of an opium issue that we had in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They threw marijuana prohibition within
the Narcotics Act, and one could actually
[SPEAKER_01]: say that these draconian laws are creating
societal ills today and that this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful medicine that cures cancer,
helps epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself have been diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met a lot of individuals from the
military that is doing wonderful success.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been scientific research how the
cannabinoids help the brain and its memory
[SPEAKER_01]: function to actually delete the trauma
from individuals with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's pretty incredible to think
that cannabis is the plant that has the
[SPEAKER_07]: backs of our soldiers, of our men and
women that have gone to fight in wars
[SPEAKER_07]: around the world, both in America and
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they come back, it's not the
government who has their back,
[SPEAKER_07]: the government whose freedom they fought
for.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this plant who the government has
been trying to eradicate since,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, for close to a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and getting back to licensed
producers, I'm with the licensed producers
[SPEAKER_01]: that I found out that are radiating the
product, which puts fear into my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an extremely healthy individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in high protein, high upline
diet, and I do not want any other process
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like organic, and I really want to
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have a choice, my constitutional
right, to choose where I get a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: product and nothing that's been tampered
with, even from the largest licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: producer in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you want to be safe,
and this is all about medicine and health,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to be safe in what you take
in your system and not get anything
[SPEAKER_01]: illegally from gangs off the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what's in that product,
and you want to be able to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity not to wait five days for your
medicine, because what happens if I need
[SPEAKER_01]: my medicine now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensaries lower crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help people in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people coming in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see you guys are doing it
up, and it's pretty relatively new.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been open just this month,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: July 1st.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a little bit of a menu we can
peep out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we have a menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ongoing project.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, wonderful, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have large variety of cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have produce stuff like Alien OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Pink Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Sativa, like Juicy Fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have Bubble Hash, which is very
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a CBD oil for people who love
to sleep and ease the pain and don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: the euphoric effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting more edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting samples from dispensaries in
Vancouver, and we're working with other
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the business, especially from
Vancouver, because it's a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legalization in the States,
in Denver, Colorado, and Seattle,
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, these are successful models on
raising money.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help with infrastructure and lower
crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, most importantly, increase quality of
life in sick individuals and prevent
[SPEAKER_07]: sickness in healthy individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: My 74-year-old mother, who's suffering
incredible pain from arthritis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and she has incredible anxiety,
I'm taking her off Larazapan.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's already off it, and she's taking
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baked goods, ingestibles, and she's
actually doing a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's sleeping, and she's not in chronic
pain anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people coming in here saying,
my wife is cured of cancer from the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people actually have real testimonies,
and it's the real thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We always like to tell people that it
shuts it off, and that they should be
[SPEAKER_07]: careful, because if they have that cancer
in them, it can shrink it and sort of shut
[SPEAKER_07]: it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would still maintain a fairly solid
saturation of my endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_07]: meaning I would still orally consume
cannabinoids, potentially maybe extracted
[SPEAKER_07]: in maybe a coconut oil, daily,
just to prevent that cancer from ever sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of growing back and taking root again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great maintaining program,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of a high alkaline diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you do get diagnosed with
cancer, they do suggest I have a high
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline, leafy diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing, go raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only plant in the world that
produces it, and works great with our
[SPEAKER_01]: body, and it helps heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something very positive,
and it's becoming mainstream, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming accepted in today's society.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do need is politicians,
and we are having politicians like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver mayor, accepting the regulation,
and Justin Trudeau, the leader of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Liberal Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Politicians like that need to think for
the 21st century, and they have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the ideation of getting rid of societal
ills in a productive manner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well said, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very well said.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to check out the place a
little bit, maybe go sit in the smoking
[SPEAKER_07]: room and hit the D-nail, and I just want
to thank you guys for doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a big deal to put yourself on
the line, practicing civil disobedience to
[SPEAKER_07]: show that your community is worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, and thanks for
dropping by.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we're going to head into the
members-only area here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to set up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to university, but not for very
long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took my Volkswagen van's advice on a hit
of mushrooms, and it was VW.
[SPEAKER_07]: VW.
[SPEAKER_07]: VW.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what that stands for in
university?
[SPEAKER_07]: Voluntary withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are repainting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're repainting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks nice for now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where we're going to set up and puff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to do a little bit of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go get waters.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in the smoking room, the vapor
lounge of the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: headquarters.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was started by Glenn, who we have
here with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to thank you for having me here,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was actually an hour away in Gimli,
Manitoba, and heard that we were here and
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to make it down and hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And do some educating with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I totally appreciate that he came
down and you vibed out with us,
[SPEAKER_07]: man.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be stupid for me not to come,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I was telling Mark earlier that
two thumbs up to you guys for standing up
[SPEAKER_07]: to open a dispensary here in Manitoba,
in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really pushing the envelope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's right on time with
Vancouver Mayor regulating dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that your timing is literally
perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I applaud you for doing it because
it's still brave.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is part of the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're putting yourself out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to do for what you believe
in, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe in this and believe in that
people, it helps people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once I started helping people,
I couldn't stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bit addictive, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how did you get into, you know,
a brief history, I assume that you've had
[SPEAKER_07]: a relationship with cannabis for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Started smoking at nine, I'm 54.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got some decades of cannabis use
under our belts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what really sort of sparked the idea
that you would start a dispensary here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Winnipeg?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there was no one doing anything to
educate people and move ahead with the
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other places in Winnipeg that
opened up and they're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know, I just felt I had to do
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the education out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: To get the education out there,
to find a doctor willing to help in
[SPEAKER_08]: Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm still hunting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doctors, doctors, doctors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm educating my doctor right now and
helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting an incredible amount of
people in the scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good call.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really where it starts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to educate the doctors locally.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would definitely urge you guys to
pull out as much information as you can
[SPEAKER_07]: from the local Sunday show I run called
Pass Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to have you on Monday,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know what's going on in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a good way for you to get your
message out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let people know in Manitoba how to get in
touch with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just sort of kind of meet you through
this unique platform that is the bubble
[SPEAKER_07]: man's world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess today we're going to sit down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told these guys I would show them a
little rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got my little rosin kit here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the little mini hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_07]: The raw.
[SPEAKER_07]: Parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, the bubble bag screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the straightener has to be flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no edges to it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you want it to be flat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll see right away when we do this
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're going to do a little bit of
headband hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a real nice smell to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 120 bubble bath.
[SPEAKER_07]: Headband's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it smells like headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a real rank sort of dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some peppery smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Spicy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Dwayne, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't introduce Dwayne and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did introduce Kelly earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dwayne and Kelly are also here with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just going to make some rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll use a nice fresh spot on the screen
so you can really kind of get an idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how good is this size of screen,
too?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a good size screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hash itself is a 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this hash was collected in a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 120 micron screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of these glandular heads would be
larger than 120 microns and smaller than
[SPEAKER_07]: 160 microns, which is the other next bag
above 120.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're familiar with the bubble bags,
they start at a blue bag, which is a 220,
[SPEAKER_07]: goes to a green bag, which is a 190
micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trim identifies it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the trim does identify it on the
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bags are all that one color.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll get a blue bag, a green bag,
190.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I've got a red, 160, the one that's
right above 120.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, the orange, 120, 90, which is
black, 73, which is gold, 45, white.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, the 25, which is this
size screen, is a purple bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the bags come with these as pressing
screens to dab the water out of the hash
[SPEAKER_07]: to prepare it for microplaning or sieving,
which is another show altogether.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we'll just get this wrapped up
in a little kind of ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what it's going to be,
a little hash ghost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a good idea to press it,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can kind of see just from pressing it
that the oils are already starting to
[SPEAKER_07]: appear on the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like we're going to get a huge
amount back, but it'll definitely be
[SPEAKER_07]: enough that you'll see it on the parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we plugged in with the hair
straightener?
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are plugged in, yeah?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys got to see that, simply
enough, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not warm at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can turn it on.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I turn it on, it can only be
turned on for a small amount of time
[SPEAKER_07]: before it'll get too warm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll have to do the pressing,
and then we'll turn it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, it's heating up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you'll hear it sizzling, potentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you'll also see the hash start leaking
at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, watch the paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the hash coming off?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, around the sides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, it's already.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so that's one.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, do you?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's like beautiful oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oil solvents made in a fraction of a
second.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a beauty smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good workout.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a small little amount of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a tiny little puck of hash that
you could then take, and you could put
[SPEAKER_07]: that into a coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could soak this, because there's still
oil soaked into the pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could soak and recollect that either
in an Everclear.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's probably the safest,
the 190 proof.
[SPEAKER_07]: Evaporate up the alcohol, and you'll be
left with glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, literally, like, very potent
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, once again, stuff people would be
throwing away, produce a high grade
[SPEAKER_07]: coconut extract with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, give them some kidney and
liver cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you use a larger amount than you just
did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends are using 50, 60 grams at a
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using giant t-shirt presses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this has already been stepped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the big version.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just for fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we just did this city.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how tacky it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, like, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always fun showing people rosin for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad, hey, guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right in front of your own eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is organic, is what it's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no... You know what I like about
this?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: As adults, we are able to find the safest
way to do things easier than we were when
[SPEAKER_07]: we were kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I love about this is that the
younger people, the younger generation
[SPEAKER_07]: that were just yesterday blowing up,
making butane, not the best way to go
[SPEAKER_07]: about things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kids blowing up is by far the worst thing
that's ever happened in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, it was the DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Health Canada is smart,
and we're allowed to produce resins in the
[SPEAKER_01]: oils but without the butane process
because of its dangerous activity to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you don't want to be blowing
yourself up or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just much easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so tacky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready, Mark?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was quite the ring.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over to Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got to basically wait for the
dabber to cool down each time because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: so hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's melting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the D now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got it all here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the Fabergé.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the Fabé.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the D Limiting from Horatio
Delbert representing in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you travel promise to promise with
your medicine on the plane?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can now, luckily, because for a while,
as you guys know, the Owen Smith case in
[SPEAKER_07]: British Columbia, which really cracked
open derivatives for all of Canada based
[SPEAKER_07]: on seven Supreme Court justices who just
decided.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it all the addicts?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All seven of them voted that it had to
change.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, Supreme Court justices.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that derivatives had to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before they did that, how that case
got to the Supreme Court was it was given
[SPEAKER_07]: a dissent, I believe it's called,
out of the Supreme Court of BC,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the provincial Supreme Court,
three judges.
[SPEAKER_07]: They took the case there, and one of the
judges basically struck down the law,
[SPEAKER_07]: changed the word drive to just marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for a couple of years in British
Columbia, we were allowed derivatives and
[SPEAKER_07]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been allowed them for my Canadian
license for several years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's federal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's federal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before, I was not allowed to bring my
concentrates to Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or to Ontario, or to Zimbabwe,
or any of these other provinces.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I can go anywhere in the country with
my derivatives of any kind, and it's all
[SPEAKER_07]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's perfect timing for YMCH to open
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the reason now you can come and
show us stuff like this here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Safely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at risk to no one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I mean, we're well past,
we don't need to put anyone at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't even start a fire with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is safe, no chemicals, no
preservatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all organic and natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what all of this was made from,
was from squeezing out hash with a good
[SPEAKER_07]: friend of mine, D420K, shout out buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we pressed that out,
made some beautiful rosin, and it's been
[SPEAKER_07]: doing me great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've left it open in the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was a nice creeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it feels like American henna.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I tried it was from... Pull
that a little closer, so we can get closer
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard of Cobb Cannabis as Living
Medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's my friend, Niece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the first time I tried it,
I thought it was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a medicinal user.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just use cannabis for all reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's industrial applications, medicinal
applications, preventative applications,
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a social initiative as well,
for people who are suffering from anxiety.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to be getting dabs here in
Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, the first dispenser, the YMCH.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This headboard is all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful with the fabricating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, the host here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The host with the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little piece of that, so I don't have a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fine nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, very fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 25 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much can you save getting cramps out
of this square piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from extracting?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean you could reuse this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, over and over.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I told him to clean it.
[SPEAKER_07]: To save the... And how much is a piece of
this host?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it sells for like 10 or 12 dollars
online.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tool that you can just use.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you have to be... We gotta
throw them away.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would just be a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I... No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thing to ask.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Open dialogue.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to share some rosin dabs with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Show you the process, which I suspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the near future, you'll be able to come
down to the cannabis headquarters and
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially pick up some rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would do well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can do it with flowers as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get flower rosin and you can
get cash rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you use the same screen for both?
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even need a screen for flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just put it right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Close it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just understand the smaller the bud you
use, the higher the yield seems to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more bud you put, if there's not
enough water, or moisture in the plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: when it's steaming it out, it has a
further distance to travel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want to use dense, dense buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you just want to... Yeah,
it's nice to even... Some people take
[SPEAKER_07]: hours and they're trying to press it up to
get it pretty ready for pressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Al will be able to walk you guys
through that.
[SPEAKER_07]: When he comes back, he'll press out some
buds and show you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen it once now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be able to do hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just that don't over press or you'll get a
very, very dark product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hash is always going to produce a darker
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll get something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas with the buds, you can get a clear
and yellow product very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sativa's probably the best to work
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all work great.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the plants that have resin will be
able to learn a lot about your plants and
[SPEAKER_07]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you'll take a bud and you'll
squeeze it and literally get nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is not in it's... Before you buy
herb, you should have someone sitting with
[SPEAKER_07]: a small hair straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you take a bud and you press it,
you open it up, and it's insane what it
[SPEAKER_07]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just oil everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other times you get almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the word of God, rather than
some salesman.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much resin do we get out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just let me pull out my hair saver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, your hair's curly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't use it on my hair,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use it to check for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, product checker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, dude, it was super awesome sitting
down here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate you hanging out with
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to definitely get the word
out and we'll have you guys on Hash Church
[SPEAKER_07]: one of these weekends.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can let us know how it's going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep us updated to...
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: ...to the fight here in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we need be, you know, you've got a
lot of people behind you at the drop of a
[SPEAKER_07]: dime.
[SPEAKER_07]: If things get rough and they start causing
problems, we'll make sure that we get all
[SPEAKER_07]: the right people behind you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome, bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always good to sit with Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't forget about Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great to have the support.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need all the support we can get in
Manitoba here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is my home province.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can I not support where I'm from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man as well,
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so I'm here with Glenn,
the owner of the dispensary here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting the name.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the... YMCH.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Medical Canada's headquarters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your Medical Canada's headquarters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm never going to forget it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's going to show us a little bit of
the bud here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like what you just said there about
if people aren't happy with the product
[SPEAKER_07]: that they buy, what do you let them do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Exchange it or if they don't want... If I
don't have something they like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give them their money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's pretty sweet right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the hybrids have come a long way,
as us Canadians are very famous for
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting and connecting the best bud
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got... That one was what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alien OG?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alien OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this one is Pink Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: The golf balls.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you were saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to have it that way, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he's Grape God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just going back through.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really pretty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we... And fragrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we sample an extraction of a bud?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to squeeze it, you mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: On parchment paper?
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly when Al gets back.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's quite good at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't want to mess anything up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this one's the PK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: PK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have some nice Rockstar here
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, very fragrant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very aromatic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grown properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice... Yeah, nice white...
[SPEAKER_08]: Ash, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flushed it proper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's nice to see that you guys are
producing some nice medicine for the local
[SPEAKER_07]: people to come and access.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm most impressed with Grape God.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything with a fruity name would be a...
Grab this one nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: ...concentrate, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to purchase this one nug.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I touched it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to purchase it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have it for being a guest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get my card here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now... Now we're maybe going to go squeeze
some of it and turn it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to give you guys an update
on your medical cannabis headquarters in
[SPEAKER_07]: Winnipeg as well as Glen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Thursday today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just uploading the video today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to get it up as a Puff
Wednesday for a Winnipeg Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately that did not work out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have been in touch with Glen and
Mark from the YMCH.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Monday, I believe, or Tuesday,
the police came in and asked them politely
[SPEAKER_07]: to stop selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They agreed because they were so polite
that day that they told them they would
[SPEAKER_07]: stop for two days and that Thursday today
they would resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put a link into the comment
section of this video so you can check it
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: To come back to it, they've been told to
not sell cannabis by the police.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today is Thursday, the day that they're
going to start selling again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put that link for the CBC story that
they did on Glen and the YMCH.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyone from Manitoba, please,
if you can, support the YMCH whether you
[SPEAKER_07]: use cannabis medicinally or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good idea to give the Winnipeg
police a call and let them know that you
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely, as a taxpayer of Manitoba in
particular, would prefer them not to waste
[SPEAKER_07]: your money harassing people that are
really just doing good for people in need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, terrible to hear, Glen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to bet you guys are going through
this, but you have a support on Bubble
[SPEAKER_07]: Man's world and we'll hope to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you guys real soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep watching Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.
you you
