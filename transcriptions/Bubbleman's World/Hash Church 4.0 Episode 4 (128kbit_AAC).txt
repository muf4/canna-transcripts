[SPEAKER_15]: this computer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just need to share the link real quick.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for your patience.
[SPEAKER_15]: 913, only 13 minutes late today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not too bad for someone that hasn't done a
hash search.
[SPEAKER_15]: And God, I don't even know how long.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to Addison and Jamison for doing
their podcast for the last couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_15]: or months or however long it's been.
[SPEAKER_15]: They pumped out a bunch of great shows.
[SPEAKER_15]: But everybody, welcome to Hash Church 4.0,
episode four.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to talk a little bit about
harvesting today.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is kind of a last minute episode put
together by Addison and the Dragonfly
[SPEAKER_15]: Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful to see Skunkman Sam's little Dr.
Seuss doll.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, it's been too long since I've heard
your voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, everybody, to Hash Church episode
four.
Howdy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: To see everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll have people popping in and
out all morning, you know, checking in on
[SPEAKER_03]: their plans, checking in on their plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to hear about the 800 pounds
mantra and what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_03]: pipeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just see everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're super very grateful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marcus, to give us the opportunity to come
on and talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure how this came about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Marcus contacted me and then had
some ideas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we all kind of got together and
figured, like, why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have a hash search and talk a little
bit about what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, Marcus, you came up with the
idea about the harvesting for solvent
[SPEAKER_07]: lists.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the kind of topic is like,
you know, talking to some farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was lucky enough to bring my own farmer,
which is a friend from Sugar Magnolia
[SPEAKER_07]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Judd, Sugar Magnolia Farms.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an honor to be in the big city in L
.A.
[SPEAKER_13]: zone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Addison and I have been trying to catch a
sesh for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: We first met at the 2014 Cup in Richmond,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was still doing testing stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was lucky enough to be working for
Sheldon Black Glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my pot and hash journey began at that
same time and honored to be here taking
[SPEAKER_13]: tabs with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Richard, man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's how we met.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's an old brother, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I met him through Ruhr.
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, before we get started,
the idea for this really was inspired by
[SPEAKER_15]: my team over at Whistler Technologies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Daniel and Andrew did a little podcast
recently where they did a little just the
[SPEAKER_15]: two of them talking about harvesting and
preparing for solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it kind of gave me the idea like I was
like, man, I know a ton of awesome farmers
[SPEAKER_15]: and cool hash makers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, why don't we kind of do that idea
that they did, but kind of pump it up a
[SPEAKER_15]: little bit, get more people involved,
more people that are actively farming,
[SPEAKER_15]: but also the people who are actively
making hash and just kind of have a little
[SPEAKER_15]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's been too long since I've seen
everyone here for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to Alice, shout out to Ganja
Gill, shout out to Joshua, shout out to
[SPEAKER_15]: Daniel and junk man Sam and 800 pounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had an amazing time recently at the
Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to Che and his whole team at the
Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought events like this were a thing of
the past.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that this was done and we were
just moving into this future where
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone was upset and getting crushed by
the new world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is old school.
[SPEAKER_15]: This was an absolutely spectacular event
made even better by spectacular people.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw one of my old buddies, Alan
Middlemas from the Kootenay crew that I
[SPEAKER_15]: hadn't seen in a decade or more while I
was there paddle boarding with my buddy
[SPEAKER_15]: Tyler, hanging out on psychedelics and the
teepee with the dragonflyers medicine and
[SPEAKER_15]: all the great people from Kelowna and the
Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Kevi and oh my God, I can't even say
enough about the Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just so, so good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin Jodfee was there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would definitely implore anyone who
wants to come and experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard talks of like, oh, this was like
the Emerald Cup in 2009.
[SPEAKER_15]: It really had a great old school vibe to
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Worth coming down, worth checking it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: They did an incredible job.
[SPEAKER_15]: Che's mom owns this incredible property.
[SPEAKER_15]: With this Rosebud Lake and all these
beautiful acres of forest surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really just can't say enough about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm super stoked to get some dabs in and
talk to everyone in regards to really,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, solventless and preparation of
the material and flash freezing and all of
[SPEAKER_15]: these things can be our topics.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, I'd love to hear
about where you guys are at, where you
[SPEAKER_15]: you've been coming from, where you're
going, where you're at currently in this
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of chaotic cannabis experience that
we're all sort of, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_15]: trapped in because I think a lot of us are
lifers and it's something that we choose.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's definitely been, it's been a
challenge to say the least.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of people have been taken out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I sort of, you know, I think of them
all the time, people that have been
[SPEAKER_15]: involved in this plant for so,
so long.
[SPEAKER_15]: That have just been unable to maintain
with the with the legality and the taxes
[SPEAKER_15]: and the sort of getting squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can, of course, discuss that as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, I would very much like to
hear any and all stories from Skunkman
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't heard his voice in a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether you know it or not,
buddy, I think about you all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've deeply affected my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been an amazing mentor.
[SPEAKER_15]: And friend.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think about you often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, dude, a man of few words,
a man of many bong rip.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, pretty excited to see the group.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very thankful for for Josh and Kelly,
as well as Addison for kind of putting
[SPEAKER_15]: together a little group.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the intensity of which Addison is
currently getting dab ready.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you can see the guy is like dabbing
the way he works out.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, no fuck around.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is serious shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get everything organized.
[SPEAKER_15]: Have your tools clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude, I love you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to make I'm trying to make Sam
proud of me.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, dude, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Marcus, I'll just double in on the
unicorn cup experience and how sweet that
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Rosebud Lake is filled with
turtles, little painted box turtles,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is like you don't find a lot of
turtles in the lakes around here in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_03]: They exist, but it's like amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have this lake and you're
camping out and it's sort of like just
[SPEAKER_03]: trails through the trees and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it definitely has that like OG flavor
to it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all the samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and it's fun to meet up with a bunch
of people you don't see a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this BC community in Alberta,
big up to all the families.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've met, you know, out there and stuff
and just had the best time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's cool to have an event up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The borders have been hard for us,
you know, going back and forth and for
[SPEAKER_03]: other people that are into natural
wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, hopefully by next year,
those things change and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd be sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's only going to grow and get
more powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and it's nice to have like the big
dance party kind of aspect to it,
[SPEAKER_03]: which they had this huge stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's just a lot of fun,
just a lot of good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know, or just I wish the
Unicorn Cup was a little bit more later in
[SPEAKER_03]: the year only because of having fresh
outdoor ganja.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's hard to get even light
depth stuff out there by August for here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's nearly impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but whatever, it's better weather,
you know, and by the time the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: August comes, like it's rain time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Alice?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear from you because I know you're
kind of down in Brazil with the on and off
[SPEAKER_03]: internet and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you tell us something good?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been in New York somewhat recently
hanging out with Liz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Liz was also up here at the Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of had that like love link
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm Flynn up and down,
up in LA, wherever, up or down,
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, tell us something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year has been a literal trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be among you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came here to talk a little about a
little bit about harvest, but this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: the first year that me and Flynn haven't
been cultivating in a long while after
[SPEAKER_00]: some difficulties with the county last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving from that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of traveling, different
cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I came to help out organize one of
the first hash cup in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did Dabadoo in Brazil and it was
the first main hash event that has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it super hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was historical to be able to experience
this in Brazil instead to blast in the
[SPEAKER_00]: paradise land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still buzzing from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually from the hash quality I've
seen from the Brazilians, multiple hash
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, barely no rosin, little solvents,
but everyone was crushing with the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very, very, very beautiful to
see and to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm buzzing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this moment, this is where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry for the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet doesn't work well in paradise.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's working well enough that we can see
and hear you.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm appreciative.
[SPEAKER_07]: What strains were you seeing down there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything we would know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that won yesterday,
they won with like a peyote cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some, saw some cookie things on
the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some like different like orange
turps, like some of the best like solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were like a super actually clean,
citrusy, beautiful BHO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you all know which team I,
I judge it by the smell and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lots of like gorilla glue still,
like people are like kind of like more
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to this old part, like little OG
little gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they love the gorilla glue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they love this San Fernando Bellator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love this, this part still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I kind of saw from the
samples from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it was a good event.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything, everything went stealth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you guys didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest issue was that we developed an
app to run the, the votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because of the internet,
a lot of people logged in and the cap kept
[SPEAKER_00]: logging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took longer because we had to do it
manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So till this part was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of it was a little like counting
the votes was stressful, but the rest was
[SPEAKER_00]: all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played, there was a rock and roll
band playing psychedelic rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event was held in a place that people
do ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was literally a round circle and
with like a geometrical, like geometrical
[SPEAKER_00]: circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was geometrical circle sounds crazy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just like a little,
a lovely place and the vegetation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the music, the people, it was small and
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part was the app, but the app
will work next year and it will be fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, next time, next year, if you guys
want, we just developed with on a
[SPEAKER_07]: blockchain with some partners that we have
an entire judging platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're gonna, we're talking about being
able to make it the other events,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, making it so that other events
will be able to use it for their ticket,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also be able to use it for the
judging.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all secure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all on a separate server.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's, we would love to,
you know, let us know next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to chat with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, let's exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to like exchange and grow
better.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what Hash Church is all about.
[SPEAKER_15]: So is Dragonfly Earth Medicine's entry in
this cup number four?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's your guava punch breath right
here, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one I picked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty like noticeable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, there's 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the first one I picked out was yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Johnny B playing with weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: He might be, he might be busy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask Alex a question and then we'll welcome
Johnny fucking B.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's beautiful to see there of him,
but I was going to ask Alex a quick
[SPEAKER_03]: question with the Ayahuasca family.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, often with plant medicine and
Ayahuasca ceremonies, there's a thing
[SPEAKER_03]: about, oh, we don't do ganja, you know,
it's like a tobacco and plant medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, you know, but then
there's different tribes that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, allow cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, and did you find in this
area that there was obviously an
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptance towards cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wonder what your thoughts were
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different churches and different
groups, they definitely have different
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely some congregate cannabis as
a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's Santa Maria that they call
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so the spirit of the cannabis is
Santa Maria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a doctrine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people follow it like a religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are rules and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here was very open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people from the, like the people that
have the property, it's a 52 acre
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological property here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do reforestation and they have,
they hold some Ayahuasca rituals on some
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very open about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like they do not want the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that sometimes it's not part of
the ritual for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not belong in the, in the ritual,
like the way that people use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've seen is a lot of people that
do go to the Ayahuasca ritual and realize
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a tough
[SPEAKER_00]: use it as like a tool, or a therapeutical
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it helps you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people also have different
intentions and actually not use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily healthy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Ayahuasca trips, that's something
that sometimes pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heard a bunch of this tobacco use and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also consecrate tobacco in the
hape form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a powder tobacco with other
herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they consecrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very connected with the roots
and the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more to help out bring the people
that are actually flying on the ritual a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more to the ground and to the
earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ganja Gill in the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Ras Kaya Paul coming in hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Daniel hanging out with Seraphim
and all these Seraphina, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just really stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Josh is out there trying to pull
buds in from the rain and he's got his
[SPEAKER_03]: some type of willow tree or something on
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I love when babies make it onto Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_15]: All ages welcome at Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_15]: And definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Kaya.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm in the middle of sticky fingers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that will be at 10.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we still got 41 minutes, 30 minutes
till the 10 o'clock push up.
[SPEAKER_17]: 4,200 push ups a month.
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_17]: 20 push ups seven times a day.
[SPEAKER_17]: 30 days.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny B has been getting it, which is
pretty incredible for a guy that's broken
[SPEAKER_15]: down.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm near every bone in his body.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you guys keep up with
Johnny B's drama, but the last car
[SPEAKER_15]: accident, someone T-boned him and flipped
his car upside down in a ditch.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's with already the surgery on his
spine and the broken, shattered half of
[SPEAKER_15]: his body and the broken neck and the
broken back and the broken legs and the
[SPEAKER_15]: broken arms and the broken jaw and the
shattered skull.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just some of the things our Johnny B has
been through while he sits there.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you've never seen the power of cannabis
as a medicine, this guy doesn't take
[SPEAKER_15]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than cannabis and his amino acids
and all these healthy supplements,
[SPEAKER_15]: he should be dead, really, or in a
wheelchair or completely fucked.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he is completely fucked,
but he's completely fucked in our way,
[SPEAKER_15]: in the good Johnny B way, in the loving
cannabis way.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate you as always,
dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always nice to see your smiling face.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm quite sure that you probably got
the best reception in the chat room as
[SPEAKER_15]: well.
[SPEAKER_15]: People are still saying good morning to
you, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny, how did you have an accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it your fault?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a duck flying from the sky?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_17]: So what was going on with this particular
last accident?
[SPEAKER_17]: Some guy was just driving down a country
road, just hanging out, things are good,
[SPEAKER_17]: listening to Napoleon Hill, just kind of
doing my audio books.
[SPEAKER_17]: And out of nowhere, some guy thought that
being on his cell phone while driving,
[SPEAKER_17]: put his foot on the gas and blew a stop
sign at about 80K and hammered me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me three times to back out of the car,
hit the telephone pole, rolled and landed
[SPEAKER_17]: in a ditch upside down, broke my ribs,
tore some cartilage off my sternum.
[SPEAKER_17]: And four days later, I was doing pushups.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, an ice piece, like,
well, that's impossible.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, well, I already live in chronic
pain.
[SPEAKER_17]: I do a lot of bong rips, I smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said that blatantly straight out.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I use in my pain control.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, and I just kept going away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Movement is how we heal.
[SPEAKER_17]: You cannot just sit there and do nothing
about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I started walking right away,
took me four days off.
[SPEAKER_17]: I started walking, started doing my
pushups, you know, using creams and stuff
[SPEAKER_17]: like that, and just being dedicated to
oneself, getting up at five a.m.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got to heal.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to move.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to keep things going.
[SPEAKER_17]: Plus, my garden was just growing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just like in the midst of putting
that in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's important that,
well, I actually got a picture here,
[SPEAKER_17]: so I'm going to show you this.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys can see this.
[SPEAKER_15]: For those of you that missed it,
when Johnny B got rear side swiped or
[SPEAKER_15]: T-boned and flipped into the ditch,
he literally went live on his,
[SPEAKER_15]: like, social media, like five minutes
later.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how I found out.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw him upside down in his car on his
social media.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, oh my God, John, what now?
[SPEAKER_15]: This is also like the third or fourth
accident since, it's got to be like two or
[SPEAKER_15]: three since just your back surgery,
no, John?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or your neck surgery?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a couple since the neck surgery.
[SPEAKER_17]: This guy hit me so hard, he ripped the
door skin, was attached to his bumper,
[SPEAKER_17]: as you can see.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's never light either.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's never something chill.
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, that's an incredible joint,
Anjagil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I don't even smoke joints anymore,
but fucking, hats off to you, my brother.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is an incredible joint.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I did smoke joints, that is a joint
that I would smoke right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry to cut you off, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while since I've moderated one
of these rooms.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a little bit rusty, you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: Here you guys go.
[SPEAKER_15]: What, this is your accident happening?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how do you have that?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's right like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought only Russians had a driving
camera on their car.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Johnny was on his phone
during his crash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you were the reason why you crashed,
because you were filming.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a driving camera.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now you can see he's sitting on his cell
phone to have dash cam.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was all dash cam.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the accident for likes.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I don't have to go on any likes or
not.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, here, here, here's the one I got
into in 1988.
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, head on by a dump truck.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was the original accident.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, I had been through several major
accidents.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_17]: Understanding it was 20% of the problem,
80% of the solution was growing from that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew from my accidents.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I grew by using cannabis, by helping
it get me through what I was going
[SPEAKER_17]: through.
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It got me off the pharma.
[SPEAKER_17]: It helped me connect to the community.
[SPEAKER_17]: It helped me build a better lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: We all do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's we give back every day.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still in shock.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Etienne, a brother from another
mother in the house.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been doing the rounds with the
veterans.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been watching them on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been doing all these speeches.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell us a little bit about that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hello.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just got back from spending a week in
Washington, DC on the Capitol Hill.
[SPEAKER_11]: Took a whole bunch of veterans.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we went after the Republicans and
Democrats on the Veterans Affairs and
[SPEAKER_11]: Armed Services Committee.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we literally had 26 meetings on
Capitol Hill in 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a big shout out to our volunteers who
came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: George Armstrong, Lynette.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Lynn Mathery, my wife, Michael
Krowitz, Brian Buckley, Todd Scottini,
[SPEAKER_11]: Nate Landau, Lenore Benalis, George
Armstrong, Tony Landry, Michael Green,
[SPEAKER_11]: and Amy Case King.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all just veterans.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we went up on the hill, talked the
talk, walked the walk, made a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_11]: of meetings, made a whole bunch of
friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, we had an agenda and a whole
bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_11]: But tired.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just literally walked 12 miles in two
days walking around Capitol Hill.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just got home yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a little tired and sore,
but need to get back there because we've
[SPEAKER_11]: got a lot more work to do still.
[SPEAKER_15]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amazing from the Canadian
perspective.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have that because I'm here and
that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's so strange.
[SPEAKER_15]: The like valor and that pride in country
and flag and the way they send you off
[SPEAKER_15]: with such pride and love and bragging
rights almost like these are good men and
[SPEAKER_15]: women.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then you guys come back and things are
like shaky and holy fuck, I got poisoned
[SPEAKER_15]: by gas.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I fucking did some things that my
brain can't let go of.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like to be able to use
cannabis and I would like and they just
[SPEAKER_15]: they just fucking they're they're
completely against everything you want.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like they don't want to take care of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this an accurate description of what's
actually going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually we're using you Canadians as
an example right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we're trying to one of the main
reasons we met is to put the Canadian VHJ
[SPEAKER_11]: and American Veterans Health
Administration in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: together because currently your system
thank you to Aaron Victory and other
[SPEAKER_11]: Canadian veterans for educating on what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Canadian veterans can actually go on their
National Canada app right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have 100 percent disability ratings
such as you you're given 100 percent
[SPEAKER_11]: disability rating by your VA, the Canadian
VA gives you up to three grams per day
[SPEAKER_11]: free of charge, depending on whatever your
modality.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I want pill, I want a joint.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a lollipop.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a sublingual.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a patch as long as it equals zero.
[SPEAKER_11]: Up to three grams in the end.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Canadian VHJ will mail that to you
within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, we're trying to we were talking
to them about reopening the Compassion
[SPEAKER_11]: Investigative New Drug Program,
which was shut down where currently only
[SPEAKER_11]: Urban Rosenfeld receives it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want them to reopen it, staff it
with veterans and grow quality of the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis of everybody here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I sell in California,
not of that crappy Mexican varietals.
[SPEAKER_11]: That they've been pumping out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're actually the main talk as is to
facilitate and get various various
[SPEAKER_11]: senators and representatives to put the
Canadian and U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: VA together so that we can get something
similar here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: in the sense of sorry to bore you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just want to have a voucher system so
we can actually the same way you receive
[SPEAKER_11]: free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, all of our veterans are on
disability with very small limited incomes
[SPEAKER_11]: and the cost of cannabis is very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we could get a voucher system within
our 10th Amendment reality so that we
[SPEAKER_11]: could supplement and help our veterans
actually get the medicine they need today
[SPEAKER_11]: as opposed to taking it out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that'd be helpful.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just one of the things that
we're working.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to get our medical card
designation on our VA cards so that if
[SPEAKER_11]: we're no matter where we're traveling
through all 50 states, territories or
[SPEAKER_11]: federal property, we won't get arrested.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, simple things that are logical,
but apparently, you know, is illogical.
[SPEAKER_11]: To, you know, the system itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you to our veterans for coming
out strong this week and making the stand.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you to the National Cannabis
Industry Association for allowing us that
[SPEAKER_11]: ability because we basically went out as
12 veterans and hit 26 different senators
[SPEAKER_11]: and Republicans directly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were very responsive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some ignored us.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're treated like shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're treated like second class citizens.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to fight for everything we have.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have banded together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we're all volunteers.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't get paid for this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're out trying to do this for the
better of everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll continue.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to get back again there soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's seven days wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who pays for the three grams that you can
get for free as a veteran?
[SPEAKER_11]: The Canadian government pays for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a subsidized program.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, they pulled out $150 million or
so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, there's a scandal I read
that just came out this week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, a whole bunch of money
disappeared and there's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_11]: scandal around it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, the Canadian government is
funding about $150 million per year to
[SPEAKER_11]: give free cannabis to veterans who meet
those qualifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean the Canadian government is
buying it from private producers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to understand how the system
works.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're buying it from the system and the
system itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're buying it directly from the
LPAs.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're packaging, like I said,
through the national app and mailing it
[SPEAKER_11]: within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, keep in mind, we have over a billion
grams sitting.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's billions of grams in Canada that
aren't selling either.
[SPEAKER_11]: Donate them.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take them.
[SPEAKER_11]: We take donations of every kind.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm sure the Canadian government's
getting that for a very good price if they
[SPEAKER_15]: have a deal with one of these big auroras
or canopies or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's not easy, cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Set it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about as easy here as it is in
California.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're only that easy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: If only it were that easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for having me on this
morning to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're humbled and honoured and needless to
say, thank you all for all your hard work
[SPEAKER_11]: and dedication.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being the leaders in Canada
to be examples to follow.
[SPEAKER_11]: So humbled and honoured.
[SPEAKER_15]: How can people support you in this cause?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there somewhere they can go and read
more about this or just really connect to
[SPEAKER_15]: you on your social media?
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a site, Veterans Action Council.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all on social media, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: We accept donations via the Battle
Brothers Foundation, which is a 501.
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally anybody who could donate
directly, that's tax deductible.
[SPEAKER_11]: We receive support all around the country
from people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're an international group.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had an Israeli veteran.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had Amy came from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not just United States veterans.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're fighting for access worldwide.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of our gentlemen changed the
international law, Michael Krawitz,
[SPEAKER_11]: in December of 2020, getting medical
cannabis removed from schedule four.
[SPEAKER_11]: So currently medical cannabis is legal
around the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things we were there in D
.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: doing is reminding the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: Attorney General's office that currently
the United States is out of international
[SPEAKER_11]: treaty favor, which we used to follow,
because if we were actually following the
[SPEAKER_11]: treaty, medical cannabis is legal in the
United States and all territories,
[SPEAKER_11]: including around the world, which is why
you're seeing other countries coming on
[SPEAKER_11]: board and pushing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why we were there in the United
States Capitol using Canada and Israel and
[SPEAKER_11]: others as examples to say, hey,
you know, currently we were telling the
[SPEAKER_11]: guys in the VA and in the Defense
Department there that currently there is
[SPEAKER_11]: an Israeli nasal spray right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you received a TBI, a traumatic burn
injury from an explosion or a hit or a
[SPEAKER_11]: concussion or an accident that they
actually administer this spray right now
[SPEAKER_11]: and it stops a TBI in its tracks because
we know cannabis is a natural
[SPEAKER_11]: neuroprotective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if somebody gets blown up in a vehicle
or something like that, they're usually
[SPEAKER_11]: down two weeks being concussed.
OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could stop the brain swelling
and stop the permanent damage that happens
[SPEAKER_11]: that the Israelis are doing, then that's
something we need.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were there trying to embarrass the
American politicians by saying,
[SPEAKER_11]: hey, look, here's Israel and Canada way
ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we not catching up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we have to wait another 10 to 15
years before that nasal spray is available
[SPEAKER_11]: in our medic packs?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that's people could use that today.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so these are the things that we're
trying to point out the hypocrisies so
[SPEAKER_11]: that we can make advancements for our
brothers and sisters so that they don't
[SPEAKER_11]: have to continue to suffer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we got off the sidelines.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're tired of sitting on our couches and
sitting and complaining about things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get off your ass.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get active.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get involved and contribute to democracy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, we'll get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Walk alongside of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll walk along with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you had a meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't complain.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just don't vote.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can speak to your representatives.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every single one of us that was there in D
.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: represented tens of thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you go and you speak to your
politicians, you're representing many
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Use your voice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Use your stance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Volunteer.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we've done things.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we've always done things.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we will get things done and
change things, because we're not
[SPEAKER_11]: financially involved.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our lives are involved.
[SPEAKER_11]: And by using our voices to act and help
out those who are the voices who can't
[SPEAKER_11]: can't speak, they will vote behind you and
they will push you forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to get out there and lead.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's all we're trying to do is to
lead by example.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like it sounds like if you're
not a person who's able to go speak to a
[SPEAKER_07]: representative and go out and talk to your
local politicians, you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a grower, if you're a seed
breeder, if you're a hash maker,
[SPEAKER_07]: Etienne, it sounds like you can donate
product to you guys so that it does get
[SPEAKER_07]: out there or donate funds that then can be
used in that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, just because you're not able
to talk to politicians, I'm not a huge
[SPEAKER_07]: friend of politicians are willing to to
really do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Etienne saying, but, you know,
I am able to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do donate to some of the different
organizations that are doing that stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: that are or even, you know, what's even
cooler is grow some weed and give it to
[SPEAKER_07]: Etienne so it can get some to some of
these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's even fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't give it to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Find a local veteran where you are and
adopt veterans.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to better and give them your free
canvas.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what guys did for me when I was
doing this back in 93.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dennis Perot's grower actually grew an
eighth and had a free eighth for me every
[SPEAKER_11]: three days.
[SPEAKER_11]: So make sure that you adopt a veteran.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care of those who can't take care of
themselves so that they have access so
[SPEAKER_11]: that they can be strong and be medicated
so that they can actually contribute and
[SPEAKER_11]: help and use their voice as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, help locally and regionally.
[SPEAKER_11]: It helps everybody nationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going to talk about harvesting for
processing, but how about harvesting for
[SPEAKER_15]: vets?
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure when you harvest kind of a
little bit of that and heading over to
[SPEAKER_15]: your vet.
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone's got to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not the cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great campaign.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's I was talking, I've got
some friends that are vets and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: they're pretty interesting guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like special forces guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love I got I dug real deep into like
living in a very undisciplined life my
[SPEAKER_07]: whole entire life, having no supervision
from birth to to up until now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never looked at any discipline or any of
that stuff like it mattered.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was always just kind of wild and free.
[SPEAKER_07]: So growing up and then getting really
interested in it and talking to some of
[SPEAKER_07]: these friends, what I learned is that they
commit and give their life to not the
[SPEAKER_07]: government, but to the group of men that
they serve with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They become a team and that team is just
like fuck this no matter what us against
[SPEAKER_07]: the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my team and I was telling them I'm
like that reminds me a lot of like me and
[SPEAKER_07]: my buddies when we were we were like
stealth and we were just a small group of
[SPEAKER_07]: dudes that all stuck together and had our
grow houses.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd hang out together after we tended our
gardens and like we were a team,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and and it was like I see a lot
of similarities, you know, and then I
[SPEAKER_07]: talked to them too about afterwards,
you know, they're out of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: military service at this point retired and
they're doing other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, you know, do you feel like
your government served you well and how
[SPEAKER_07]: did it end?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you listen to a lot of the stories
that typically they're tapping out and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're leaving that because they're
either, you know, a lot of them get
[SPEAKER_07]: accused of things that they didn't do
because of, you know, the the conditions
[SPEAKER_07]: of like, you know, engagement and rules of
engagement, different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all these different stories,
but a lot of them in the end aren't really
[SPEAKER_07]: happy with the government and how the
government, you know, ends up doing them
[SPEAKER_07]: in the end, whether it's through veteran
services or other ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of odd when I talk with
those guys, I'm like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a veteran of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we served in a different
way, but we facilitated the the the
[SPEAKER_07]: production, distribution, transport for
consumption of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that's what the fuck we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made great livings doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we got into science and we got
into all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they all love weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every one of them that I know,
they really value the compounds,
[SPEAKER_07]: the other compounds that we value.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also value the neuroprotecting that
cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why it's so crazy at the end to
hear about there being a medicine that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: spray that works as a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: When when is that is that product
available?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like a drug currently available in
a medic pack right now in Israel?
[SPEAKER_11]: So why is it not available at a medic pack
right here in the United States?
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it not in a medic pack for the
Mexico?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it not because they never wanted us
to succeed with weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it empowers us to live our own life
and not give a fuck what the government
[SPEAKER_03]: thinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just part of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But doesn't the money go from the US?
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't tell Israel.
[SPEAKER_11]: They said fuck all that and did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you guys give them billions of
dollars, though?
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't you buy that for them?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we paid for it.
We paid for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The money doesn't go to Israel,
America.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've already paid for this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we talk it out?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they're going to try and put us
together and have those conversations.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can get illegal oxycodone and all
these other drugs on the street,
[SPEAKER_07]: we should probably be able to find this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call a guy, see if we can get some
because this is this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess we can call it a hash
church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not happy with the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, you know, in sports medicine for
that spray, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can think about all these
athletes, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we were just at a park and
my little boy was seeing a football
[SPEAKER_02]: practice and he's like football.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, I don't I don't know if you
want to play.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, you need it in the canvas.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're talking about sativas.
[SPEAKER_11]: But seriously, whenever they go into that
blue tent for a CTE, they should be
[SPEAKER_11]: shooting them up with that nasal spray
because it's the same traumatic injury
[SPEAKER_11]: that's going to continue to swell,
which is going to continue to disable that
[SPEAKER_11]: person, cause nerve separations,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: So between cannabis and then if you use
mushrooms to reconnect those nerve endings
[SPEAKER_11]: that have separated, you're actually
healing and actually bringing yourself
[SPEAKER_07]: back into homeostasis preferably using
using the endocannabinoid system to bring
[SPEAKER_07]: the body into homeostasis, which is
fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also using a very specific nanoscopic
vehicle to deliver those drugs,
[SPEAKER_15]: to break the that that brain blood
barrier.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the one thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully in the very near future,
I'll be able to talk about what that
[SPEAKER_15]: vehicle is because I know what that
vehicle is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have a company right now that we're
looking into that particular vehicle.
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe in the next couple of months,
I can I can talk about that because it
[SPEAKER_15]: really does finish the circle.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're talking about, you know,
delivering the payload and getting it to
[SPEAKER_15]: where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_15]: And making it still effective because the
blood brain barrier is super fucking
[SPEAKER_15]: heavy, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: It keeps out like almost everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we were specifically on what even the
endocannabinoid system was.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, because the majority of them don't
even know because, again, recent
[SPEAKER_11]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, you could literally start to
see their eyes just glaze over when you
[SPEAKER_11]: started to have that discussion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are where that where doctors or
science and scientists because some of
[SPEAKER_11]: them are they got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some of these know they don't
get it so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked to a lot of defensive fellows
and the thing that got to them,
[SPEAKER_11]: which are basically their officers who are
basically assistants to senators and
[SPEAKER_11]: representatives for a year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they basically work in their
office.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're basically they're being bred
into perfect little generals.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, by using the TBI information
specifically, that was a way to get
[SPEAKER_11]: through to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, again, we're looking at ways to
connect with these people to get what we
[SPEAKER_11]: want.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can talk all the legalization and
medical this talking that TBI spray was
[SPEAKER_11]: the arrow through all the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of them pretty much for the most part
were like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's logical.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's not a bunch of people sitting
around and smoking pot, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_11]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again, it's also about finding how we
connect with these people using language
[SPEAKER_11]: so that we can get through all the
prohibitional lies that we've had for 70
[SPEAKER_11]: plus years and make a human connection so
that they understood that this could be
[SPEAKER_11]: you, because we also use Alzheimer's as an
example in using the the the the patent
[SPEAKER_11]: that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: has as a neuroprotectant and showing these
senators and representatives specifically
[SPEAKER_11]: your government has had this patent.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so why is Israel and Canada being able
to benefit from us?
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're being laughed at and our guys
and brothers and sisters are suffering.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we know why.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know why.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we know why.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to hit them in their third eye.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is how we got through.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are skills we're learning and we
want to teach you so that you can be
[SPEAKER_11]: better at talking to these liars so that
they can see through the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: All taken, which is the psychedelic aspect
of life, too, which in Canada you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not just weed that you can get for
three, you know, three grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can now, starting in January,
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, every every drug is up to two to two
point five grams, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's two and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in DC, just in the.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get to like help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Affect reality, which is which is super
powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we don't also really kind of need
to dance to all those that those songs,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we have other songs and other
rhythms that we dance to and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's a time where we can kind of
choose our own adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes you feel like
you're banging your head against the wall
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you see a little glimmer of light
down the hallway and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, maybe I'll try out this other this
other realm stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like it that that everything's
happening at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thankful for it being fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we get to talk about all the
good things that happened in the summer,
[SPEAKER_03]: the the activist stuff that we're doing
and then watch the ganja develop in front
[SPEAKER_03]: of us, knowing that these compounds are
listening to us talk and the plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're helping communicate with us
because we're breathing in their air and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're breathing in ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that cannabis is going to help
propel all these thoughts forward,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trichomes, they're crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get affected by thoughts and they're
water, we're water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just really appreciate the intention,
you know, and everyone coming together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a slight shift, I wonder how
everyone's dealing with their crystals
[SPEAKER_03]: right now in their harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, is it raining in your world?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it rain in August?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you feel a warm to cold night shift?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we get sometimes rains when it's
warm out and it's terrible for the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we get rains with cold nights,
we really don't get the mold because they
[SPEAKER_03]: have this inner plant shift that happens
that they're all, you know, it's the wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to hear what some of the
people are feeling in their harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what's being what's being done right
now to prep for resin harvesting like like
[SPEAKER_07]: loss.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you what are you guys doing right
now?
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you cleaning up the plants a bunch
the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have mostly been pulling in light
depths and in the end of August here,
[SPEAKER_03]: right after the Unicorn Cup, about August
25th, we got heavy humidity and we have
[SPEAKER_03]: been a mountain valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the mount, the whole valley fills up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sometimes you get these just
clouds going through the valley and we
[SPEAKER_03]: just call them death, death, clouds and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But luckily, we have we will do pushups to
what oh, you're doing pushups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 o'clock, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: 49 pushups.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like we had glitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but we're really thankful this year
for the harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't watered our greenhouses for
like a month and a half now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just zero water, just keeping it
dry there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we do get rains, instead of
dropping the walls, we pull the walls out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so the water is kind of going
away from the the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases, leave the end walls
just totally open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just allows enough a little flow
through, but there's no like blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, mist coming coming on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm so stoked about the one greenhouse
left right now there's zero mold in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have these cold nights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can literally see like whole
layers of new crystals come on like
[SPEAKER_03]: overnight, when it gets down to 35 39,
you know, degrees, which is what close to
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're close to freezing at this
moment, you know, in these times and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big time cool years zero power powdery
mildew around even on you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ground and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using way less tea, and way more
just in the soil building and way more
[SPEAKER_03]: into the the layering and the mulching and
all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like it's really helping our
plants because the plants just go into the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and they're just like, Oh,
this is what I have to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not necessarily over pushed,
you know, with nutrients to where it kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of becomes vulnerable, it becomes okay,
they become huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they are they have a the cells
and the way the plants grow, and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: just their soil going on, they tend to be
healthier, and they hold themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't trellis so much, you know,
but we're not dealing with 20 pound giant
[SPEAKER_03]: plants either.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, you try you trellis a plant
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so it's been it's been good for us
this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it sounds like there's a lot of things
that you've got to take care of in regards
[SPEAKER_15]: to the the flower itself, right,
in regards to molding and not kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: rotting out.
[SPEAKER_15]: But are there any things other than I
mean, obviously, each year, you're going
[SPEAKER_15]: to make hash out of your varieties and
press them rosin and smoke those ones.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you you're keeping the guava
lines going.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, those came out so beautiful in
hash and rosin that are there anything
[SPEAKER_15]: else that you're doing at this time that's
really specific for the resin?
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a thing about too dry in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sometimes that there's some of
the weeds will start dying and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of have to keep a little light
make sure there's life going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when plants die, they tend to get,
you know, more pathogens on them to help
[SPEAKER_03]: them die.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, it's not we're not doing any
sprays, no foliar sprays and minimal,
[SPEAKER_03]: minimal watering towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, it's just walking through,
keeping a really good flow through
[SPEAKER_03]: environment for, you know, to to manage
the pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's we're having zero pest issues
because we have so many flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every greenhouse is surrounded by food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, another thing you just
had deer and bears, you know, rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: through our greenhouses this year more
than ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, it's like, oh, it's cool to
see a bear.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, like when it's in your house,
like every day all summer, it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have like deer in the middle
of the day, like hanging out, like when
[SPEAKER_03]: you walk into a greenhouse, you're like,
she has a fucking deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so the animals are coming in
quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I don't know, I just think it's
keeping walking through every single day,
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three times a day, making sure
everything is cool, making sure nothing's
[SPEAKER_03]: falling over, keeping the weeds lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's flow through and really like
just praying, you know, just playing
[SPEAKER_03]: music, you know, and also keeping like the
prayer vibes going and ceremonial sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that helps a lot,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're thankful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone asked what the guava lines that
you're working with are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Top dog or only.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then also, I will also add that we've
also had the bears late winter.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were still skiing at the end of May.
[SPEAKER_15]: My friends were still sledding in June.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the snow was really, when they came
out of hibernation, the snow was all
[SPEAKER_15]: around them and they got pushed down lower
to find food.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when that happens, generally they just
stay low, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we saw like an 800, my kid was on
his trampoline the other day.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, mom, there's a bear.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're just like, oh, like which,
which direction is it running?
[SPEAKER_15]: Our trampolines like down on the road.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's down there with his little
friends, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's just so chill.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, oh, it's walking up the hill.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going into the mountain.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if it turns around, just come up to
the house.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and my buddies were visiting in
from Vancouver and they're like,
[SPEAKER_15]: look, is this normal, dude?
[SPEAKER_15]: You just have like giant bears walking
around your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, well, if you did notice we live
in a forest and there there's only two
[SPEAKER_15]: options.
[SPEAKER_15]: Leave the bears alone and then they'll be
around or kill all the bears.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you won't have them anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we went for the first one there,
just leave the bears alone.
[SPEAKER_15]: When they call those conservation
officers, the only thing those guys can
[SPEAKER_15]: serve are their jobs because they're the
ones that kill the bears.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't conserve them.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of logging and stuff as
well, but I would just say there's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear Madison, how powerful and strong
they're almost like a dragon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, are they chopped their teeth
together, but they're so docile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you watch him walk through a
garden, in some cases, they'll just bear
[SPEAKER_03]: their way through like squash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really, but like in some way
they just tiptoe through.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've even had them open our car door with
just a nail, whatever, and grab like
[SPEAKER_03]: chicken food out of the car and walk away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's zero scratches on the car,
which sucks that they're in the car,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, and we have to keep the food out,
but it's kind of like, wow situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guava punch lines came from Kush Kirk
in Southern Oregon, who I thought might be
[SPEAKER_03]: here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had been working with the purple
punch and the punch breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Cal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some interesting blood brain
barrier talk earlier today, which would be
[SPEAKER_03]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, you know, just, I just like to
say everyone, all the DEM peer family,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the coffee from Kaia, we continues to
grow in the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's new lines that Kaia has
been working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he was at melting of the heads and
you guys rocked out a really fun time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super excited to hear more about
everyone's varietals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting just really amazing
stuff from family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super stoked about heart rock Daniel and
these hashy auto flower lines that he's
[SPEAKER_03]: been coming out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really blessed to be trying those out
this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't necessarily do them in numbers
this year, but we wanted to see kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: what the finishing time would be like up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them all worked out like
super well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bravo Daniel.
[SPEAKER_12]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue thunders, the lemon head chem is
just starting to come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue diesel and, oh God, what was the
last one that we just harvested?
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you know, just thank you for
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people up here in Canada and
BC are really feeling, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: have actually have bought your seeds over
the last few years and are continuing to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's good for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun to see them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was saying, I think it's good for us to
read like we've been pulling tarps for a
[SPEAKER_12]: whole lot of years and now to be seeing
varietals that are catching up so we don't
[SPEAKER_12]: have to do that, that we can put our
energy elsewhere and more into internal
[SPEAKER_12]: work and into family and community and
places where we really want to be rather
[SPEAKER_12]: than pulling tarps.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a really beautiful free up,
I think, for the whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis community and, you know,
putting our energy where we where we want
[SPEAKER_12]: to put it and having good varietals that
allow that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun to see those grow up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys do have something good to
submit to the AutoFlower Cup, the injuries
[SPEAKER_02]: are due at the end of October.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one, I think that's in
mid-November in Northern California this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be there as a guest speaker and
bending.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a super successful AutoFlower
breeding program this summer where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: probably made over a hundred hybrid
combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it was like part of my goal for
these past few years to just breed the
[SPEAKER_02]: lion claw in with full terms and then make
them autos but make them polyhybrid so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I could start with a polyhybrid
that's fully auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of try to bring some strength
and vigor and then go from there and work
[SPEAKER_02]: down the IBLs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by fully auto, does that mean it has
two sets of auto genes, male and female?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the auto flowering, it's a,
it's a recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't show up till the second
generation of inbreeding, but it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: three generations to make it auto,
you know, six to make it like stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it, it you can cross an auto end of
the photo period and just inbreed them or
[SPEAKER_02]: outbreed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I did like, you know, a blue dream
auto with a cookies and then a cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: auto, those are, those F1s would not be
auto flowering, but you could cross those
[SPEAKER_02]: two together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next generation, which would
also be an F1 would show up with a 25% or
[SPEAKER_02]: less auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of have been working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the 25% that are auto flowering,
they are, they've got auto flower genes
[SPEAKER_01]: from both the mother and the father,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not if you cross an auto end with a
photo sensitive, but that 25% would have
[SPEAKER_02]: both parents genes, but it would be
expressing that recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would select two of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you really wanted to make like
the auto blue dream, you would go three
[SPEAKER_02]: generations down to make an auto flower,
but then you would back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, and that makes a lot of sense
from what, just what I've noticed from
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding that, you know, to really
stabilize the trait of that you'd want to
[SPEAKER_02]: go back across to the F1 or back to the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that would really then bring the
structure and the effects of the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream out further in that, in that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd go a couple more
generations down to six, and then you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: have a fully auto, you know, whatever the
photo period you were starting with.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like something Canada needs.
[SPEAKER_11]: How are your flowers looking this year?
[SPEAKER_15]: They look not too bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, you know, I went and thank you for
asking that because really what it allows
[SPEAKER_15]: me to do is shout out one of my longest
time friends and mentors, Ron Hickey,
[SPEAKER_15]: who I got to see while I was out in
Proctor BC in the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hadn't seen them for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So for those of you that have watched the
channel for a while, you'll have seen a
[SPEAKER_15]: couple of videos with me and Ron on the
making hash, making dry sift and bubble.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just, he's a super character.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just one of the greatest people that
I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I got to spend time with him.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, before I arrived,
he was like rushed to the hospital with,
[SPEAKER_15]: with COVID.
[SPEAKER_15]: He ended up, yeah, like I'm on the way.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like seven hours into my eight hour
drive.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get a call from his like roommate
guy that helped with the plant will shout
[SPEAKER_15]: out to will and Ron's on his way to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's having problems breathing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just like, Oh my God, I'm super
worried about him now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm at his house by myself,
hanging out with sort of the people that
[SPEAKER_15]: take care of his plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And luckily he came home the next day.
[SPEAKER_15]: He did have COVID.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still hung out with him for a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_15]: He kept at a distance and wore a mask
while he was in the house and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just, I still got to hang out with
him a little bit and vibe with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, you know, if you know Ron,
he's got plants all over his property.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got his greenhouse and he's got,
he moved the plants all day, like nonstop
[SPEAKER_15]: as he's like, Oh, the plants got to have
the best son.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's just moving all these fucking
plants all around his property in the most
[SPEAKER_15]: insane of ways that only really Ron could
possibly do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it irks him for the plant to not be
in the best son.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so he had a lot of plants,
six or seven or eight varieties.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so he gave me seven or eight of these
different unique plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got them out on my deck right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're probably like three weeks,
maybe four weeks into flowering.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they've got like another month in a
bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a Congo out there that will
probably do another, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: six weeks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: I might have to bring it in and put it
under a LED light if it starts raining
[SPEAKER_15]: here soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was nice to have plants at the
Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was, I think the only one who had living
plants, because Ron was like, you got to
[SPEAKER_15]: take these plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had these plants around my tent.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was lucky enough to be sitting with
these dudes.
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell was their brand called?
[SPEAKER_15]: Mounts or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a Mount something Mount.
[SPEAKER_15]: The two, oh, they both had the same name
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, it's terrible that I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really nice young guys that are working in
the industry, making beautiful Mounty
[SPEAKER_15]: hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, he was like, I know bubble
man, you know, I listened to you and Kevin
[SPEAKER_15]: talk and I want to find, I want to find a
haze.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to get into one of these,
you know, sativas.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the guy next to me, Tyler was like,
listen, if you're trying to get into a
[SPEAKER_15]: sativa, what you need to find is that damn
Congo plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can find that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as he's saying that, I just get up and
walk away because I'm thinking I'm going
[SPEAKER_15]: to give these guys the Congo that Ron gave
me to bring here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I did while we were sitting there,
I came back and I put it in his lap and he
[SPEAKER_15]: looked all confused.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, that's the plant that Tyler was
telling you, you need to get.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was just like, mind blown.
[SPEAKER_15]: His buddy still didn't know what was going
on until he just turned around and gave
[SPEAKER_15]: him the plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And his buddy was like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, it's the Congo that the plant
we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_15]: So shout out to Ron.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron for, for just being so awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't even remember the name of all the
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a Congo out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a black domina out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a white wrecker.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he called it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one that was called Ezra.
[SPEAKER_11]: What plant did you see that made you go,
wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: This one that he called Ezra was just like
covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was so covered in resin outdoors in the
Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just reminded me every time I go to the
Kootenays, I see it in the water in the
[SPEAKER_15]: water, it reminds me of the one that was
out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called the Caltivar.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the name of the kid who was living in
his house and brought this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's out there right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the first one that's turning like the
hairs are turning pink in the cold night,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it looks like these plants are very
little.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're like a couple of feet tall,
just, just some ornamentals really,
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even, you know, take them out of
their pots.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really not a big grower.
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I wanted to have, what I am is a
big hash maker.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love the relationship of,
I'll tell you, there's a show on Netflix
[SPEAKER_15]: right now and it's all about pizza.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's called Farm to Table Pizza.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a six series, six episode series.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm telling you, these people are us
in the pizza world.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're all unique and different.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a Korean woman.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a Japanese guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, there's a couple of Italian
dudes.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's this really cool woman.
[SPEAKER_15]: From Portland.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've all changed the game in the
face of pizza by becoming obsessed with
[SPEAKER_15]: getting their hands into the dough,
creating their own dough, visiting the
[SPEAKER_15]: flour field, the wheat fields,
visiting the fig trees and all the
[SPEAKER_15]: different ingredients that they end up
really changing the face of pizza.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's totally fucking inspirational.
[SPEAKER_15]: Each one in their own right.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can tell are just absolutely
legendary.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's so they're out forging mushrooms
and they're out forging berries and
[SPEAKER_15]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're talking about the biome and
the farming and the regenerative.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just talking about everything that
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's neat that we're going to end up
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And even the Italian pizza chef saying,
back in the day, the pizza chef was the
[SPEAKER_15]: lowly chef.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were looked down upon because we were
just making pizza.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now they've elevated this pizza to
what I would call full metal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pizza.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just reminiscent of our
community, especially people like best
[SPEAKER_15]: friends and ganja gill and the dragon
flyers medicine, just like really getting
[SPEAKER_15]: your hands into the soil and understanding
that the magic happens in the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't have to be overly complex.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, obviously, the volatile
organic compounds are going to be very
[SPEAKER_15]: complex and profound and have depth.
[SPEAKER_15]: But how we can get there doesn't it can be
very simple.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't look flashy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not like what's the word I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a guy just walking in his farm with
his rubber boots on.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now he's walking into the forest and
he's picking mushrooms like our community
[SPEAKER_15]: has that aspect of that sort of farm to
table aspect of like when we the one
[SPEAKER_15]: Italian guy says at one point,
the reason my pizza is so special is
[SPEAKER_15]: because I make all my dough.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't let machines make my dough.
[SPEAKER_15]: If everyone makes pizza and machines,
everyone's pizza will taste the same.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that was like a profound statement
to me that really made me realize like,
[SPEAKER_15]: yeah, this is us, the cannabis,
some of us in the cannabis industry that
[SPEAKER_15]: are really passionate about this and love
the understanding of the botany of the
[SPEAKER_15]: plants and the biology and all of the
things that are happening in regards to
[SPEAKER_15]: the field and the environment and the
terroir.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the person who takes it,
those hash makers, we're always so quirky.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're always so obsessed.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're always we're just a different breed
of people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want to get right in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to show much like these pizza
makers what they all wanted to do was they
[SPEAKER_15]: wanted to honor the ingredients they were
given from the growers and the genetics.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they wanted to create something that
honored that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that as a hash maker sums up what I
want to do in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it really made clear why you guys are
so, so, so important to me and the work
[SPEAKER_15]: that I do because I'm not a grower.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not growing plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not getting in the mud.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can I can grow plants, but I'm not
that's my focus is is honoring what you
[SPEAKER_15]: guys have done and creating something of
value and creating something that can be a
[SPEAKER_15]: little wind in your ear, a little just a
little moment of happiness while you're
[SPEAKER_15]: hitting that bowl or twisting up that that
that joint.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like that really go forth and be
saucy, he says.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that describes the exploration
of just fermenting and for a regenerative
[SPEAKER_03]: farming and building your soil and you
will culture and making all these layered
[SPEAKER_03]: beds and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just are like, wow, look at all these
ingredients we can make soil out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And holy shit, look at the flavor coming
off this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not heat or light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're in castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the whole environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think that's the exploration
of the flavors and the turps and do it for
[SPEAKER_03]: the turps and do it for the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the feed your soil, not the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole exploration is kind of that
pizza exploration you just described.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Gil, I was wondering now that you
want pizza because Marcus just said all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you survive the fire and how are
you doing this year and everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you got like sweated on really hard
in Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did it affect your harvest and how
you feeling right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you're at the coast,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I escaped the fire unscathed yet
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been at the same place for 10 years
and I feel like I've dealt with fire more
[SPEAKER_06]: than half the years there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the last three have been pretty
brutal, so it's definitely getting old.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, doing fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: The place made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire, I think, is still burning as of
yesterday, but we got some rain this
[SPEAKER_06]: morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping it kind of put it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just part of life in California now,
especially Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the lightning complex?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like, you know, that night it
was like hundreds of lightning strikes on
[SPEAKER_06]: a really small isolated area, like really,
really small.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it lit 15 fires right outside Willow
Creek.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, every year it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, it's like,
oh, it's close.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it gets closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these fires now become one
hundred and fifty thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or now they're like really close to town
or there's multiple.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like over and over again that
that immediate area, the Willow Creek area
[SPEAKER_06]: has happened really rough these past two
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely feeling for all the farmers
that are really bad just because the
[SPEAKER_06]: nature of the market isn't super great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to have Mother Nature kind of
like throw you curveballs is just like
[SPEAKER_06]: literally the death blow, I feel like,
for a lot of people where we had a really
[SPEAKER_06]: late spring.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really cold and it kind of fucked
up people's depths pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the structure was off like small
flowers, twiggy stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the fires came in and it's like,
you know, it costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like your livelihood being threatened
every day, which the stress is just
[SPEAKER_06]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like it costs money to deal with
wildfire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm sure people do realize,
but there's just all this extra stuff you
[SPEAKER_06]: have to deal with, you know, that like you
don't really anticipate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like it's definitely a hard year
for farmers in that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really feeling for them, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Houghton Ponick has a question for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, given all the fires, how much
longer do you think the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_15]: is really viable for long term cannabis
production?
[SPEAKER_15]: The climate is only going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think it will shift growing to the
north?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's this real question,
you know, like it's hard to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't predict the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say it doesn't like wildfires going
away anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I tell myself like the same
place twice, but it actually did in that
[SPEAKER_06]: sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like we had fire just to the south of
us last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's just to the north of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even with all that burned,
it's like there's still lots more to burn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, do I think it's financially
viable for big business to be in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_06]: County?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if that makes sense,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I don't think big business belongs in
Humboldt County in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The place for mom and pops, like farmers
who live here and they're so rooted in the
[SPEAKER_06]: community, but like even with all this
stuff, it's still unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, yeah, I think cannabis will
continue to go on personally because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: just part of our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us about some of your hype
strains or something that did kind of turn
[SPEAKER_03]: out sweet this year and all that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all talking like I like harvested
weed and stuff already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's only like September,
like 18th over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't chopped a single branch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I had some people hitting me about
the rain, like, oh, I'm going to harvest
[SPEAKER_06]: it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lot of my stuff like triggered
later this year for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm looking at like Halloween,
like, you know, November harvests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, luckily you can usually get away
with that in Trinity County, especially
[SPEAKER_06]: these last few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year was wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of went to shit quick, but this
year is looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a storm going on right now that's
calling for like a couple of inches,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm hoping it then kind of turns
around and is nice for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_06]: season.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, my farm's small.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like as I always, I have a garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I don't really have the stresses
that like all my friends have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, living in the heart of the
triangle and balancing between Humble and
[SPEAKER_06]: Trinity County, you know, everyone I know
is a farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool to get to walk their farms and
see what they're up to and hear about
[SPEAKER_06]: their struggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I'm going to be honest,
a lot of their struggles aren't my
[SPEAKER_06]: struggles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my thing's just not really of that
magnitude that it really calls for that
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that can be a thing in itself,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just just hearing that, you know,
you're going to be around doing the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing in five years, you know,
check yourself and what you're involved
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool, though, because sometimes
it takes getting, you know, steps and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything to get where you're going and
everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: But and I feel like that last question
about, you know, is cannabis still going
[SPEAKER_12]: to be grown in the triangle?
[SPEAKER_12]: I just it's the big question that humanity
has dealt with in migratory patterns of
[SPEAKER_12]: crops.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we we know that corn has
traveled all over the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: And was it because corn was so popular or
is it because, you know, different
[SPEAKER_12]: climates changed and soils got blown out
or got flooded?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so it's an ever changing earth.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's part of the flow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that as humans, we're just
seeing a really another big change in the
[SPEAKER_12]: earth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows if it always happens or if it's
something that's just happening right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: But either, you know, humans are just
always going to be chasing the good soil
[SPEAKER_12]: and the good sun because we get our food
from the earth.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of people don't necessarily
recognize that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now all of us recognize the importance
of medicine from the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Steve is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a desert of medication.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of happening in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's amazing how dry it can be down
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll just say from a fire perspective,
like British Columbia can get gnarly with
[SPEAKER_03]: fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had one really close to our
community recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's the fire thing is like
trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And OK, so I think we should do less
fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Josh, are you are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear Josh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy for you to say something,
Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, they're talking about the
desert vacation in the West.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're the logging of the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here in California, there was an
old growth rainforest and in the western
[SPEAKER_02]: United States used to have eight times
more surface water because of beavers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even where there are beavers,
there's not apex predators anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like so many beavers have been hunted
for pelt or like the farmers in California
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of like the Central Valley area.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took the beavers out because they
would mess with their irrigation and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, it's it's wild what we
have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fire is one of the the roots of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I look in the forest here and you can
walk there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing my son, Bodie, and I was like,
look, you know, he's like, how can we get
[SPEAKER_02]: the creeks to flow more because the creeks
are dry, except for the headwaters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was showing him the the old growth
stumps that were taken and they're so well
[SPEAKER_02]: spaced out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had this like thick forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely helped my brother and I just
wanted to say that, you know, the the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: I study from Yogananda says the goal of
yoga is to be unshakable amidst the crash
[SPEAKER_02]: of breaking worlds because it happens
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say amongst all the turmoil,
like I'm having one of the greatest heart
[SPEAKER_02]: openings of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not not a Kundalini awakening,
but a Kriya awakening from the crown to
[SPEAKER_02]: the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is a beautiful planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know when we're going to get
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'll be telling my
grandchildren, grim fairy tales of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world that we grew up in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully they'll be telling their
grandchildren or somewhere down the line
[SPEAKER_02]: of the seven generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it is interesting in the chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis was like the last outpost and
it's been we're all in the belly of the
[SPEAKER_02]: beast now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, then, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm I'm not going out the back
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to we're going to all find a
way to cut our way out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And death is the soil that roots life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I when I see the chaos in the
world, I see compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see rich soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that Yogananda Pramanath that you were
dropping there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been studying his teachings for 14
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, man, I probably read his book maybe
15 or so years ago, Autobiography of a
[SPEAKER_15]: Yogi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, he does lessons that come in the
mail like you get to every two weeks for
[SPEAKER_02]: like a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, very cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get too many people dropping
Yogananda's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Gil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gil, you never mentioned any of those hype
ass strains that you were going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I got some cool shit from fucking
seed that like that's what I'm most
[SPEAKER_06]: excited for, like for clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I got some guava skittles,
some sticky papaya, that motor breath
[SPEAKER_06]: papaya.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing a little bit of that gush,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like that's going to be like a
super popular strain that everyone's
[SPEAKER_06]: growing this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hear some I got kombucha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a bunch of cool seeds from that
flying lion dude in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_06]: His like slurnade and nasty lemonade.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all like dosy and like lemonade
crosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And trying to remember what else.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some cool citrus 25 from Graham,
Mr. Bob Hemphill, crickets and cicada.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seed company runs with his wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: He like gave them to me like I feel like a
couple years ago in like a sandwich bag
[SPEAKER_06]: when I ran into him one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like when I seen him this spring
and I was getting all his puck crosses
[SPEAKER_06]: that I'm really excited about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go on, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I was just saying yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm excited about those pucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some really cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff's really granular where I
really think there's some like cash
[SPEAKER_06]: potential in a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, he gave me another pack of that
citrus 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a northern lights cross that he
thinks is hashy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited about those.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like orange turps, but they seem like
they'll hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that I'm probably most
pumped about is all this taliman stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: that a friend up in Oregon made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Friends with archive.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's basically taliman to rainbow
belts, taliman to that astreus,
[SPEAKER_06]: that chem d gb6 tricks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taliman's a dumper too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said theirs is like an 8% or
supposedly, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited about those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they crossed it to the honey bananas
and the jungle cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some there's some cool crosses
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you know, I haven't checked out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of just put them in this one patch.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get really big or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like an opportunity for me to
kind of like walk around and smell them
[SPEAKER_06]: and check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully find something cool in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm really excited about the
taliman, the taliman honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that'll be fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: They smell good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, like I said, they're looking
like they're gonna go forever,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely gonna be a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, it sounds like a pretty tasty
menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even in the same country.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you are you gonna be?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember last year, I think it
reached out to you last year to about
[SPEAKER_07]: legends.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think you were able to,
to come down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to get out of the forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, it was in November,
right by Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now we've for that reason,
we've kind of pushed it into the first,
[SPEAKER_07]: the first weekend of December now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it gives people a little more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'd love to, I'll DM you and see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make the pilgrimage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Josh, what kind of herb are you
standing standing in front of?
[SPEAKER_03]: And welcome, Craig, we love you looking
forward to hearing from you and calling
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone we haven't heard from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try and just hit each up each
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, how you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: So good to be here with y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some actually some coffee right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I was on the on the call.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let them go a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're just getting dumped on right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just in the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of our crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like perfectly in the window right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I was going to freeze some
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what's cool about just kind of
the nice thing about hash for us is that
[SPEAKER_04]: we can kind of diversify our crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's nice to do a little bit of
frozen and a little bit of a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of, you know, cured and just kind of play
around with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to do a lot of our own genetics
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like people are really into
like small batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosin, you know, a lot of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm interested in things that
dump, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of times I'm kind of more into
like what kind of flavors we can find that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, small batch or or I
guess niche, as you could say,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we've sort of been discovering
with the legal market, the new market and
[SPEAKER_04]: all this craziness.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if everyone's growing pushments,
you know, the dispensary can't have like
[SPEAKER_04]: five pushments from five different farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if we have like a Papaya
Valley goo, nobody has that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of times, yeah, a lot of
people just want variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can tell you what's my favorite
strain right now, but it could change
[SPEAKER_04]: tomorrow or even if there's a strain I
don't think I like, maybe the next day it
[SPEAKER_04]: works in my body chemistry in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just kind of playing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just super grateful to be in this
position that, you know, and have some
[SPEAKER_04]: recognition of being like in the Dempure
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: People always reach out to us like,
hey, love what you do, like love to
[SPEAKER_04]: support the DEM community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always such a beautiful thing to
hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just putting one foot in front of
the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just just keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this plant like Marcus was
saying about the pizza man that resonates
[SPEAKER_04]: with me big time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pouring out here, but there's nowhere
else I'd rather be than in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like why it's like this is this is
putting a mall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our genetics can hold up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have like a little bit of mold
here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, for the most part,
like Josh, you were saying healthy soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: like regenerative ecology practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for the most part, I feel like
the plant can really feel our intentions
[SPEAKER_04]: and we get good yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even this year, we were kind of wanted to
scale down a bit and do most of the work
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves and keep it real, real boutique
style.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to be working out pretty
nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our kids are a little older now,
so we're able to do like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: ninety five percent of the work on our
own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you Craig, Craig, are you working
with Nasha and are both you working with
[SPEAKER_03]: Nasha or I couldn't remember if that was
true?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nasha's Nasha's been doing some I think
they kind of stick to humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spoken with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sound interested, but it seems like
we're not really in there in their radius.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we yeah, we do fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been in fresh frozen with a couple
with surprise surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple of rosins out and we
might be working with a couple other rosin
[SPEAKER_04]: companies this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's it's cool to see a lot of the
farmers up in the triangle right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really exciting time as a hash
maker.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say that just simply because the
nature of the market has people looking
[SPEAKER_06]: other avenues basically for, you know,
more revenue and more than ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are diversifying, like Josh was
saying, and freezing stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking to work with hash makers,
you know, doing whatever they can kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, so it's cool to see all the
different people now prepping material for
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just nice to see all the
different hash genetics being made.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot like exciting things as
bleak as it is at times.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also exciting to me, like I said,
currently to see all that's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the rain kind of makes things a
little interesting as well, because a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of people do do the fresh frozen where I
feel like last year was like the first
[SPEAKER_06]: year that we really experienced tons of
rain during the harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people were trying to freeze
their their material.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the materials sold by the
fresh frozen pound and water is heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's got to be a factor when you're
buying material or, you know, working out
[SPEAKER_06]: some kind of split or whatever you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always funny to see the challenges
that the rain adds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year, it rained so hard, I feel like
it kind of reduced some of my my yields
[SPEAKER_06]: overall.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was like scoping live plants,
the apex of the plants had like less heads
[SPEAKER_06]: on them than as you move down towards
like, you know, the lower stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was literally days on days of
torrential downpour and the sun never came
[SPEAKER_06]: back out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just a wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, hopefully the storm passes
and the weather gets nice again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as Josh said, it's just like parts of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's parts of being a farmer where you'll
just remember, oh, yeah, that one year
[SPEAKER_06]: that rain came in the middle of September.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's always challenges that just
always going to be something, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's pests or whether it's just
part of it and kind of keeps it exciting
[SPEAKER_06]: and nerve wracking and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I want to show a real quick flip,
because we're talking about preparing
[SPEAKER_15]: material for for the for solventless
extraction.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm trying to figure out how I can do
this without it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It wants me to make it full screen,
but that's just way too big.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I can't see if I can make this a
little smaller.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I cannot.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to try and share this anyway.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very short clip.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is McIntyre farm in British Columbia
in the in the Okanagan.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is them flash freezing their
material on the field.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me know if you guys can.
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably won't be able to hear it,
but you should be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's talking about freeze drying the
cannabis as it comes off the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those are like those cryo freezers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen some of those for sale from like
the BHO days where people are kind of like
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to just get rid of them,
where you can kind of come up on them for
[SPEAKER_06]: like a quarter of the price they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the plants manicured at all?
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to ask the same thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: To a degree.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, these guys still have a lot to
learn.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me just find where we are here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop share.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can check that out at McIntyre Creek
dot com.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just like the footage of the,
you know, those those little cryo conveyor
[SPEAKER_15]: belts of the plants going in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, they definitely could have secured,
trimmed those leaves a lot better,
[SPEAKER_15]: but just the idea that there's at least
some companies already in the knowledge of
[SPEAKER_15]: understanding that preserving volatile
organic compounds is important.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, a lot of people, they ship this
stuff at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have no interest in making it cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is one of the things we've had
difficulty in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: When the chain of custody is with me,
my hash is at minus 20 to minus 40 degrees
[SPEAKER_15]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like once I've made it, it's in a freezer
and it's just staying very cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm preserving those volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: The second it leaves my facility,
unless I pay a ton of money, sure,
[SPEAKER_15]: I could probably get it shipped in a,
in a, in a reefer that's that's cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what's going to happen is it's going
to get to where it's going to one of the
[SPEAKER_15]: provinces, and then they're just going to
put it in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there's been problems with that,
where people are growing decent cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: people are making nice products with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it's sitting like going right
from a freezer to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: 100 degree Fahrenheit warehouse,
because it's the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And oh, there's been a problem with the
barcode.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that happened to my own
hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: The hash was like, white gold coloured
when I shipped it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when people were buying it,
it was like completely dark, it literally
[SPEAKER_15]: cooked in this warehouse for three days.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you've got to, you've got to kind
of deal with that lack of control in the
[SPEAKER_15]: chain of custody.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, it's kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when you're talking about pairing
your material, for, for harvest,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, preparing it for the hash makers
versus the guys that are putting it into
[SPEAKER_15]: eights or pre rolling joints, those are
all different preparations.
[SPEAKER_15]: But now, you know, we do what we do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's no more of that, like,
from the farmer to the hash maker,
[SPEAKER_15]: we can really control the environment that
of which the cannabis and the resin fits
[SPEAKER_15]: in.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the minute we get it to market,
you know, I go into these stores in
[SPEAKER_15]: Canada, and they all have their drinks in
coolers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these drinks have like two milligrams,
five milligrams, 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what they're choosing to use
their cold space for to make these drinks
[SPEAKER_15]: cold while the hashes and the flowers are
all sitting at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe they're sitting there for a
while, who knows, it could be weeks,
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: But by the time someone buys it,
you know, combined with the fact that for
[SPEAKER_15]: a very long time in Canada, people were
buying very, you know, we were regulated.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have to buy packaging that is
regulated.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't just get to pick what you like,
it has to be agreed by the government and
[SPEAKER_15]: the things they were allowing and
regulating were very poor packaging.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them in particular was,
you know, it was the seal on top of right
[SPEAKER_15]: here, there'd be a little seal that go
over it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's supposed to be sealing your jar
of nugs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what would actually happen is the
volatile organic compounds would
[SPEAKER_15]: pressurize inside the container.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they would eventually consume the glue
that was holding the seal on, just consume
[SPEAKER_15]: microscopic fissures that allow now this
pressure to escape and these volatile
[SPEAKER_15]: organic compounds to leave the container
while being replaced.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that seal was getting consumed by the
volatile organic compounds and pushing
[SPEAKER_15]: out, you know, the pressure of the jar.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you've seen it where it lifts up
and bubbles up those compounds,
[SPEAKER_15]: those volatile organic compounds,
they're, they're volatizing at like,
[SPEAKER_15]: room temperature and colder.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they would consume the glue or
whatever material they were using to stick
[SPEAKER_15]: that to the top.
[SPEAKER_15]: Little microscopic fissures would be
blowing out the volatile organic
[SPEAKER_15]: compounds, replacing it with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was all giving a really bad name to
the people who were producing these
[SPEAKER_15]: products.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of these people like from the black
market that came to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: they just wanted to get legal,
immediately started getting attacked like
[SPEAKER_15]: they were big licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's very much a narrative in
Canada that legal weed is shitty weed,
[SPEAKER_15]: that there's no way that you'll ever make
it good legally.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though these people literally support
every other industry in the world,
[SPEAKER_15]: like where they buy their t-shirts and
where they get their food and where they
[SPEAKER_15]: get everything happens the same way.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for some reason we're very,
we're very, you know, and I get it,
[SPEAKER_15]: very sensitive when it comes to the
cannabis plant that we've been stewarding
[SPEAKER_15]: for all of these years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I still believe that legal
cannabis, federally legal cannabis here in
[SPEAKER_15]: Canada can be good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've met enough cool craft growers at that
Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw some beautiful products,
but there does seem to be powers that be
[SPEAKER_15]: the same way they're in California,
just trying to drive the industry into the
[SPEAKER_15]: ground, trying desperately.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like they didn't realize that like by
jailing us for decades at a time and,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, shooting our dogs and taking our
children away and really going back to
[SPEAKER_15]: even in Cairo, from the Hash Church,
Legends of Karfur there, wrenching out the
[SPEAKER_15]: Sufi's teeth with pliers if they had
cannabis or hashish in their belly,
[SPEAKER_15]: the hash eaters.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like none of these things work.
[SPEAKER_15]: We never stop.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like those are the most, like what can you
do to someone that is more personal than
[SPEAKER_15]: taking their children and wrenching out
their teeth and putting them in a cage for
[SPEAKER_15]: a decade at a time?
[SPEAKER_15]: None of that stopped us.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why they think trying to tank
these industries are going to stop us
[SPEAKER_15]: either.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also, like Daniel, look at the,
you know, the chaos as like compost.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: The more they try to bury us, the more we
grow up through the chaos and produce
[SPEAKER_15]: tasty, loud things that attract people's
attention.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not getting rid of us anytime
soon, so that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were born in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_15]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did anybody else find it ironic that you
froze while talking about fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did like that actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you getting the same rain?
[SPEAKER_03]: How's the Coyote Blue looking?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite hash varietal this
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is Nascha working out good?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to your family always.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry I was late.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a good swell coming in,
so my daughter and I went and got some
[SPEAKER_14]: waves this morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually thought I'd see Gil out there,
and it looks like he was here instead.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, Harvest has been going really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We run seven different cultivars,
so that gives us timing, and that also
[SPEAKER_14]: lets us, over the years, we've learned
that, you know, what's it saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: You can only pound so many pounds of crap
into a five-pound bag.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, so many farms don't scale according
to their drying space or their curing
[SPEAKER_14]: space.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a limited space there,
so we go with a different cultivar so they
[SPEAKER_14]: come off at different times, so we can
really maximize the full potential of our
[SPEAKER_14]: farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Coyote Blue, yeah, we're done.
[SPEAKER_14]: We took the second round yesterday,
and she's in.
[SPEAKER_14]: I left like two plants out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always like to test a couple varieties
that I see out there, so I left two full
[SPEAKER_14]: plants, see how they push on through the
rain.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for the most part, yeah, the barn is
full, and that's ready.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Coyote Blue is not a hash cultivar at
all, but we have a really good flower
[SPEAKER_14]: market for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're actually going to be doing some
Coyote Blue gummies, strain-specific
[SPEAKER_14]: gummies, through Soulful, so super excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And other things we're running is Guava
Gift through Green Source and Cush Kirk.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the second year for that, Baron did
really, really well with our Rosin.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of like one of those outliers.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, ooh, barely produced enough,
but oh my God, after it sat for a minute,
[SPEAKER_14]: the turps were just super, super nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: And after running it through the whole
season through sales, and everything,
[SPEAKER_14]: that our flower market and dumps.
[SPEAKER_14]: What else did we run?
[SPEAKER_14]: Strawberry bananas become a staple on our
farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: First run, we always run the strawberry
banana.
[SPEAKER_14]: For our dep run, we're just running cold
frame hoop with pretty much nothing but
[SPEAKER_14]: infrastructure just to pull the cover.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we pull off that run in mid to late
July, and that strawberry banana,
[SPEAKER_14]: that was bred for a hothouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it comes off really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll throw a shade canopy over it to even
keep those turps a little more.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have all these little things I do that,
in my mind, I think they work.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll throw some shade over that two
weeks before harvest and pull that one
[SPEAKER_14]: off.
[SPEAKER_14]: What else did we run the first round?
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, my, my, oh, gushments.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to do a little fill in because we
couldn't get all the cultivars we wanted.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we ran a little bit of gushments.
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, that was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we ran a little double OG chem
just for our flower market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this round, the replant,
and we do our second round as a set it and
[SPEAKER_14]: forget it, we call it, where we're not
doing any sort of deprivation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the set it and forget it round is
papaya palm and rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're working closely now directly with
purple city genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: And those guys just put out fire,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So anything that's in our, in our lighted
up situation, which is about 2,500 square
[SPEAKER_14]: feet is from clone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's part of that program.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other 7,500 square feet of
the farm is all full season from seed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just, this program has really
worked well for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been honing it and making sure that
if we run something, we can send some to
[SPEAKER_14]: our flower market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the rest goes to Baron at Nascia.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this is the first year we did
just a little personal wash last year with
[SPEAKER_14]: simply Adam.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really happy with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was our little taste of fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Baron has a signed up for two larges
and a small or two larges and a medium for
[SPEAKER_14]: freezers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And everything we have, we're going to do
just a micro batch of fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's, that's about as big as we can
go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, we know scarcity drives a
market.
[SPEAKER_14]: So our skews are flying off the shelf,
which is really good in this day and age,
[SPEAKER_14]: but that I say, that's a big as we can go
because we're off the grid, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't want to fire up a bunch of
generators to do this whole process where
[SPEAKER_14]: if we bring those freezers onto the farm,
like a week before we need them,
[SPEAKER_14]: we'll fill them with water.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jugs and get them, get some ballast in
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that way we're not pulling a lot of
power all at once.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we have a little hiccup in the
night where power cuts out, cause our
[SPEAKER_14]: batteries gave up, it's not going to be a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're running the two bigs and the
smalls.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can go in and out while we're
harvesting into the small move into the
[SPEAKER_14]: larges.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the larges can even be loaded in the
van and taken straight and take out some
[SPEAKER_14]: of these nuances of supply chain,
like Marcus is talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're also feeling what you're talking
about, Marcus, like the supply chain from
[SPEAKER_14]: manufacturing, from the lab to the market,
you know, I don't know if Baron was on
[SPEAKER_14]: already.
[SPEAKER_14]: He mentioned he was going to be jumping
on, but man, there's challenges.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like some of the big distro companies are
like cutting corners or doing the best
[SPEAKER_14]: they can.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they send just a box truck and you're
like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[SPEAKER_14]: back up, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's really, what we've always
felt strongly about is working with our
[SPEAKER_14]: retail partner that understands what we're
trying to do and run these small batches
[SPEAKER_14]: with the small vans and really nurture
that market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're finding that consumers are
willing to drive past other shops to come
[SPEAKER_14]: to the shops that care.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're still the only place you can get
our flowers still only at Soulful,
[SPEAKER_14]: but our resin and pre-rolls you can get
anywhere where Baron's working,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, nausea extracts, and we're
keeping it in that loop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so far, you know, knock on wood,
but we're still grinding and we're still
[SPEAKER_14]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we still got a smile on our face.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's, you know, pretty much the
story we got going right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, a lot of the other guys I
heard talking this morning, talking about
[SPEAKER_14]: the rain and nuances, you know,
that identifies the vintage, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you go, you know, 2021,
that vintage was this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And with resin and hash, you know,
this is where Hubbell County, Mendocino
[SPEAKER_14]: County is going to shine finally.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we've been producing for resin
specifically for five, six years now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're just honing in our skills even
more.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we just feel that those plants that
can have full season interacting with our
[SPEAKER_14]: towar and our living soils, those are just
a joy to work with and Baron seeing better
[SPEAKER_14]: and better results than something that's
like being snapped out in two and a half
[SPEAKER_14]: months.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: It really isn't when you have that full
season potential of all those turps and
[SPEAKER_14]: the plant and that it's working for us at
least.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other thing that Baron,
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of that is really important.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Baron kind of feels like bells down
in Mendo at Heritage, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: they're handling Mendo farms, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And let those local ecosystems evolve and
let's not drive product way back up to
[SPEAKER_14]: Humboldt to wash it, to send it back
south, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's really work within these ecosystems
and support the farmers that are,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, within a shotgun's blast of each
of these manufacturing facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it makes the product more affordable
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you're not, cause if you look at
it on the manufacturing side, if the
[SPEAKER_07]: product's getting transported all the way
across state, you've added like $1,700 to
[SPEAKER_07]: that load of material that's going to get
ran.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all going to come out in the,
in the cost, you know, and what that's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be sold for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always like, I support the shit out
of that because it makes so much more
[SPEAKER_07]: sense and product grows well in that area.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no shortage of manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no shortage of manufacturers in
the area, no shortage of distributors that
[SPEAKER_07]: can get it down to the shops from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really should work that way too,
you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one thing we've always done is we've
always tried to look ahead as to when
[SPEAKER_14]: we're going to need transport.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've never just worked with one
company, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: We always think of it as FedEx,
UPS, who's going where, when, and when can
[SPEAKER_14]: we jump on when they're already doing
something?
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have Redwood Roots literally at the
bottom of our road.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've got air conditioned vans ready
to rock.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I literally just sent a load to
Soulful and it's like, Hey, when are you
[SPEAKER_14]: going to Santa Rosa?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we're going Tuesday, half hour charge,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: To go from like A to B.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we just needed like A minus,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So that, that all helps shave the costs
and, and, and support these vans and these
[SPEAKER_14]: little micro distros.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know- Well that transparency in
the scheduling allows you to, to do
[SPEAKER_07]: business with them, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they don't have that, it makes it
really tough because then, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, it's, it's a service.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, no, believe me, I deal with that
logistical stuff all day long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, I, I would love to get
product down to LA, you know, our flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have so many people that are anxious,
you know, enjoy our flower down there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't see the logistics happening
in this market we're in at this moment,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe someday in time, but at the moment
Soulful is about to open up across from
[SPEAKER_14]: Golden Gate Park.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we're pretty much like, you know,
scarcity drives their market and we're not
[SPEAKER_14]: going to stand to hit these needs.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just going to be out and then we'll
be calling our friends and neighbors and
[SPEAKER_14]: having them engage in the system that
we've, you know, helped nurture and steer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So one less thing I want to leave you guys
before I, you know, step off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here, we did a farm tour with one of
Baron's long childhood friends and he's
[SPEAKER_14]: Himalayan, Himalayan clarity on Instagram
and they're friends from India.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he has this business where he,
he, he is able to get these clear
[SPEAKER_14]: Himalayan crystals.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know a bunch of you are waiting for
these.
[SPEAKER_14]: So check out Himalayan clarity on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: He gifted some of these after our farm
tour.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're just stunning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely clear.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, absolutely clear.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got some smoky quartz from Siberia.
[SPEAKER_14]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew there were some crystals in the
house.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: From Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_15]: True stoners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just bought one the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even talk shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try those crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them in the soil, grow them underneath
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to charge them up on the
solstice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful crystals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Himalayan.
[SPEAKER_15]: What was his Instagram name?
[SPEAKER_15]: Clarity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Clarity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Makes sense that it was clarity after
seeing that crystal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's going on with best friend farm?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, just hanging out up here in Maine.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like you're doing more than just
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who can do this?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just I'm here alone on the farm today,
but was doing some last minute
[SPEAKER_16]: pollination, select pollinations before
the rain comes in and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_16]: spotly, you know, checking and pulling
before things come in on the farm.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, just been hunkered down and
going out at kind of small teams this
[SPEAKER_16]: year, trying to keep everything really
efficient and streamlined, really paying
[SPEAKER_16]: attention to the soil and the cost down on
it coming from the farm, kind of like
[SPEAKER_16]: simple diet for the plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's worked really well this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have some cool stuff to share,
you know, later on when I see more of the
[SPEAKER_16]: finish.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we kind of focused in on our tea
rhythm with it for the season.
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides healthy top dressing and refurb of
the beds, we have good living soil after,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the five years here.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've kind of paid attention to keeping
the bioactivity alive, feeding the soil on
[SPEAKER_16]: a continuum for the cost down where we
really weren't paying for much for outside
[SPEAKER_16]: input, but local liquid fish inputs.
[SPEAKER_16]: That we've kind of gone back to a more
whole food diet with fish meal meets
[SPEAKER_16]: compost with a slurry checked in every
week.
[SPEAKER_16]: And anyway, kind of simple for cost down.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm seeing really good results from
like, well, I call it surf and turf
[SPEAKER_16]: because we're just very simple once a week
hit.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, results are we carried great
health with the soil at the point that it
[SPEAKER_16]: was at through the year and so far for
just a really minimal cost down.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm happy with the health and we paid
a lot of attention this year to the early
[SPEAKER_16]: onset plant cleanup with like cleaning the
bottom third of the plant really well
[SPEAKER_16]: early on three stages of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, so a lot of stuff going on,
a lot of new strains for hatch and a lot
[SPEAKER_16]: of new F1 spread actually already.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm kind of like paying attention to
some stuff when it comes to the really,
[SPEAKER_16]: really loud terpenes that come up front
noticing that they don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_16]: always wash the greatest for plants with
the energy divided into the terpenes
[SPEAKER_16]: upfront really primary.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm paying more attention to some of
the what maybe like a subtle nuance
[SPEAKER_16]: secondary turps that show up where they're
not as loud, even up in the mid flower,
[SPEAKER_16]: but they seem to come in, but not
overpowering into the late session of
[SPEAKER_16]: flower.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've kind of seen some other cultivars
that people are having success with that a
[SPEAKER_16]: couple other gardens that seem to be that
I like that sticker reading that Marcus
[SPEAKER_16]: and that's going on that at least when I
did like the mid flower check on some
[SPEAKER_16]: types that are fairly common.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about when we're always we still
always talking about terpenes,
[SPEAKER_15]: but we know that some of those more funky
intense smells are actually styles and
[SPEAKER_15]: style weights.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we, are we getting close to moving
into volatile organic compounds?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we still going to use terpenes as the
lingo?
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I hear everyone talking and I'm not
against it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just feel like after Nick dropped all
that knowledge a year ago on hash church
[SPEAKER_15]: about styles and style weights and esters
and esterfication of terpenoids and like
[SPEAKER_15]: there's other things going on there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get that there's this big percentage
that we're assuming is all terpenes,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I wonder, you know, how important are
those styles and those style weights and
[SPEAKER_15]: the volatile organic compound profile?
[SPEAKER_15]: I know in the world of hops, they're
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder how important they are.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Skunk is a, is a, is a couple of different
styles that create that, that very strong
[SPEAKER_15]: smell.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder how much of what we think are
terpenes are actually different volatile
[SPEAKER_15]: organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some, I have some pure tiles right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking of repeating some of my
earlier work where I tested each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual terpenes with pure 25
milligrams of pure THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suspect that the, the tiles,
I think they're there's a small chance
[SPEAKER_01]: that they may contribute to the synergy,
the way terpenes do in, in being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the strength or possibly the
modulate the effects and the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: subjective effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have some pure styles now, skunk man Sam
quote, who the fuck else in this room
[SPEAKER_15]: would have said that, that sentence?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you should recreate those.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you realize that was like 22 plus years
ago that you, that you did those
[SPEAKER_15]: experiments in your apartment?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it's hard to remember the world
before the terpene knowledge explosion,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we all had, we knew some cannabis
was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also knew that a lot of the better
stuff smelled better, but nobody really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really was able back in those days to show
scientifically that the, the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: effect can both modulate and some
potentiate THC and also active synergy
[SPEAKER_01]: with the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I feel blessed that I got to do that
experiment with you almost 20 years ago in
[SPEAKER_15]: your apartment when you pulled out all
those pure cannabinoids and all those
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am in the right place at the right time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew it was historical while I was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that it was 20 years ago actually
makes me feel old, but it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And please do do that with the files and
invite cool, wonderful people from the
[SPEAKER_15]: community, as you always do, because 20
years from now we'll be talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they definitely are incredibly more
potent when it comes to volatizing and
[SPEAKER_01]: filling the room with a run over dead
skunk type smell.
[SPEAKER_11]: So skunk man, if you could take one thiol
with 25 milligrams of THC, which one is it
[SPEAKER_11]: currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look at my list again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty spaced out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is one which strongly,
I suspect, and that's the one I have.
[SPEAKER_15]: The skunk one is n-butane-1 thiol.
[SPEAKER_15]: N-butane-1 thiol is one of the three that
make up skunk.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is from Nick Ziegler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that to all the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look on the bottle because I
don't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sulfur compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But warned over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not open this in my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think someone in the audience who's
really knowledgeable, Sharif, is an
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing human being who does a ton of
research in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's calling on the GC times GC mass
spectrometer to see everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think he's calling out it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't have the ability to see all
of these compounds and quantify them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's where Nick Ziegler changed
the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what Sharif is calling out,
there's not an assay that we can't just
[SPEAKER_05]: plug it in like we can right now with the
other terpene classes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish Nick was here because he spent a
decade doing this with hops.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he put multiple machines together.
[SPEAKER_15]: He spoke about it here in Half Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like to the trillions.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was beyond the proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can easily test for thiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no problem at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much less what happens once it's igniting
those combinations or those new volatiles
[SPEAKER_11]: that are created that we aren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yet, but becomes binders between the lung
brain barrier that creates a chemical
[SPEAKER_11]: reaction in the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to have Nick on and then have
also Sharif as well chime in because it'd
[SPEAKER_05]: be great to have this conversation
broader.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we can do it maybe next week.
[SPEAKER_15]: If Sharif wants to get me his contact
info, I'm bcbubbleman at icloud.com and I
[SPEAKER_15]: can reach out to Nick.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get into more of this volatile
organic compound conversation or at least
[SPEAKER_15]: let them get into it and the rest of us
can listen and learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no doubt that the thiols
contribute to the smell when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether or not they contribute to the
medical and or recreational value of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that has yet to be shown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they volatile when they're drying or
preserved and freezing like everything
[SPEAKER_03]: else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not as well as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very, very volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Colin, are you in New York?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I'm in Massachusetts and in New
York on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are going to be speaking up by Zoom
at the Organic Cup in New York because
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not going to be able to go across
the border the way that they are right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the way we felt like we
had that it was open in a way that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be able to do it, but we just
don't feel like it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're also really excited about it,
though, to support that movement in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York and on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many amazing people
involved and all the farms that are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the genetics swaps and just the whole
focus in New York as is blossoming for an
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic Cup is really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited to see that blossom
out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been waiting, as you know,
over 25 years for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be really cool because
there's a lot of hidden talent that just
[SPEAKER_05]: wants to come out and they want to talk
just the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was once scared to share the things that
I loved about all of it and the things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I was passionate about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're going to see a lot of
really cool, just fresh ignited energy
[SPEAKER_05]: into the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you feel there'll be a mixture of
indoor and outdoor farming because of
[SPEAKER_03]: northern New York and central and all
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thought on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, when you guys were talking
about the terroir and the Appalachia,
[SPEAKER_05]: New York has microclimates as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really great pockets of areas to
grow cannabis and other crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a really good season.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not over yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to pay attention to the
tropics.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the time to really pay attention
to Africa and what's going to rip off of
[SPEAKER_05]: there and go through and up the coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that'll eventually hit us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've over the years been trained to
kind of look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the next week, we have a hurricane
that's kind of forming right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now until October 10th is kind of the
time that makes or breaks a good season.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot to be seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But thus far, it's been a really good
season, not a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of like a picturesque
season for the East Coast outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of just what type of growing
styles we're going to see, I think we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to see a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: New York is going to be imagine the way I
kind of look at cannabis in New York is
[SPEAKER_05]: like if I could imagine the streets in New
York and all the different types of
[SPEAKER_05]: people, that's the kind of growing styles
that we're going to kind of emerge out of
[SPEAKER_05]: all this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to see a lot of that
personality come through and it'll have
[SPEAKER_05]: its own kind of its own voice and each
kind of style.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited to see what people
bring and people pay attention to
[SPEAKER_05]: different things in different parts of the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm curious to see what
people are looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just with the way that smoking is in
the city right now, I think it's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of fun for people to go to the city
and be able to just smoke anywhere and the
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the Astor Club is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Liz has talked about going there a lot and
some of those smoking clubs are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it would be cool to see what that
experience is like for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's and historically people have
gotten high quality cannabis in New York
[SPEAKER_05]: for a long time, for decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been always a scene there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Sam can speak on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's you know, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just excited to see the diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's the exciting part for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just seeing all the people that are
like, you know, maybe I knew them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and we just weren't talking
about it together, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's I think that's the coolest part.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I want to see, you know,
just the what people are doing in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the farms right now are just
doing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people have had the time and the
infrastructure to build greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_05]: but not too many of them are actually
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and how is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there hash processors and people like
starting to look for farms for resin or
[SPEAKER_03]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really early.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we don't know what the
testing is going to look like yet here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't I know I'm sure people are
putting things aside for fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we don't know what the testing is
looking like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know there's just there's so many
unknowns.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the stuff, the guidance hasn't
really been given out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the scary part about where the I
think the state's at right now is that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of people have invested a
lot of time and money into things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's fresh frozen for a new
market like this, unless you're you're
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a scary thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not I don't know if it's going to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, if I really do the math on how
many acres are being grown versus how many
[SPEAKER_05]: people are in population there,
there's not nearly enough, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you really break that down.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've spoken to a few groups in New York
who are, you know, you're right,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's beyond early, like they don't even
really have their licensing, let alone
[SPEAKER_15]: like funding or building.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, the people that do have the
infrastructure that kind of already grow,
[SPEAKER_15]: even just hemp, they're they're
definitely, you know, talking about debt
[SPEAKER_15]: and equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've been talking to them
through whisper technology and kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: just getting them prepared for an existing
circumstance where, you know, someone said
[SPEAKER_15]: it earlier on, I think it was Don Jagill,
you know, you have to you have to find
[SPEAKER_15]: these elusive pockets of profitability.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to be able to figure out ways
that are maybe it's not quite as easy as
[SPEAKER_15]: it used to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: It used to be real easy, which created a
soft environment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now people are in this harder environment
and they're working much harder for much
[SPEAKER_15]: less payoff.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just yeah, I see them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see them gearing up and getting ready.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very early.
[SPEAKER_15]: What does it happen after January?
[SPEAKER_15]: The licensing will be announced.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's further out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's the thing, like you have to,
you know, it's hard to really explain,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, you know, take everything that's been
said and, you know, it's elongated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at May of next year for
that real the real guidance for like the
[SPEAKER_05]: not just the conditional licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's next year, like middle of next
year, maybe May.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe May is the soonest that it will come
for new guidance on like actual like
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation licenses and micro businesses,
because right now I'm actually giving some
[SPEAKER_05]: comments on the micro business licensing
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, that could be
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's some cool paths that
could be built through that structure that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're allowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the conditional, we have to remind
ourselves that these two years right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: this 18 months or whatever, we want to
call it these is just a conditional.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just like, here's an opportunity
to use your acreage right now for a stop
[SPEAKER_05]: gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll help us and give you an
opportunity to try this, try this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know even know how many of
these conditionals leave and actually
[SPEAKER_05]: poured over into real licenses,
you know, cause that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the license, you know, the whole
structure of all this is just still
[SPEAKER_05]: actually super infant, you know,
I hope a lot of them print, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: transfer over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just don't know who will actually
want to, you know, I was going to share
[SPEAKER_14]: something that it's been said a few
different ways.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll share it in a way that somebody
just shared it with me a couple of months
[SPEAKER_14]: ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is good times make for soft
humans, soft humans make for hard times,
[SPEAKER_14]: hard times make for strong humans.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the cycle repeats itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're in that time right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: We just came off of some really good
times, a couple of decades, slaying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now, now, now the strong are going to
swim their way to the surface and
[SPEAKER_14]: hopefully help pull this whole community
through, you know, this community when I
[SPEAKER_14]: say it, not just here in Humboldt,
but like our global community.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's moments like this where we can
all reach out and discuss our,
[SPEAKER_14]: our triumphs and our wins and our
successes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And our fails really helps bring us all
together and gives us allies, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love hearing, you know, little whispers
of things that are happening, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: with someone I'm with or someone that
someone else is with and Ooh, I know them
[SPEAKER_14]: and they know them and we're doing
something or they're doing something and
[SPEAKER_14]: that's all exciting.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just appreciate all of you and
Marcus, I appreciate you bringing this
[SPEAKER_14]: show together for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super, super stoked.
[SPEAKER_15]: Potent, Potent Ponick says people in new
markets, unfortunately don't understand
[SPEAKER_15]: why the higher end concentrates are worth
more.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the biggest issue with the higher
end product, just educating consumers on
[SPEAKER_15]: quality.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll speak to this.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when you hear him say that he's
not talking about our inner community of
[SPEAKER_15]: hardcore hash heads.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's talking about the people who are
inevitably going to be the future users of
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of them have never used cannabis or
dabbling in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you know, here in Canada,
it's the 60 plus percent of people who
[SPEAKER_15]: don't use cannabis, who aren't using
cannabis, that the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of trying to say, hey, check this
out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it's a better option than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to cause you all these
different health ramifications.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a preventative medicine, even though
we're not allowed to say that right now,
[SPEAKER_15]: like all of these different things and
how, yeah, it's a unique situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: What he's saying is very true.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I found is I can try and release a
five star bubble hash or a six star bubble
[SPEAKER_15]: hash out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the people who would rather criticize
me for releasing products that they have
[SPEAKER_15]: no interest in, you know, dry sifted
product, pure hash joints or the hash hits
[SPEAKER_15]: that we're doing, which are built for
convenience and more importantly,
[SPEAKER_15]: built to build a bridge to that 60% of
people who are going to buy a pre-rolled
[SPEAKER_15]: joint.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't even have rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_15]: They literally have a lighter as their
only means of paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_15]: We wanted to create a product for them
that could build a little bridge so they
[SPEAKER_15]: could kind of come on over to the extract
world and just check it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And believe it or not, if you want to get
their attention, you don't do it with six
[SPEAKER_15]: star fucking bubble.
[SPEAKER_15]: That shit will terrify them.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like being like, hey, great person,
come try this Ayahuasca for the first
[SPEAKER_15]: time.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be really fun.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here, drink, drink an extra cup.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to take them in slow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just even like what we think of as
like, you know, a dry sift and hash,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's like a single screen hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: My God, Sam would call that a farmer's
grade hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not what we are looking for,
but it is a great way to create a little
[SPEAKER_15]: bridge where someone can, you know,
smoke a little bit of hash instead of that
[SPEAKER_15]: paper and glue and maybe flour that's not
even that good because they don't know the
[SPEAKER_15]: industry and they're buying pre-rolls from
the wrong company and it's milled and it's
[SPEAKER_15]: dried out and it lacks turps.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I just want to make a
better experience for people who are
[SPEAKER_15]: coming into this to get turned on to
something that's special.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if that can lead them to that full
melt bubble and then they can understand
[SPEAKER_15]: instead of have no understanding,
well, they're standing down here trying to
[SPEAKER_15]: get up here and we're not building the
steps for them to get up here.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're expecting them to do this giant jump
and they're not going to do that
[SPEAKER_15]: regardless of how we want it to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in reality, is that really how you
want to turn people on to like the most
[SPEAKER_15]: beautiful, like the strongest,
most purest, you know, representation of
[SPEAKER_15]: the plants, the cold water and ice
extracted, you know, resin or dry sifted
[SPEAKER_15]: resin that's clean to the same level.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are like up at the same podium when
people can't just go there right away.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very much into giving people micro
dabs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very much into trying to give someone
an experience where they can still try,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's micro.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've done this for, you know,
80 plus year old people.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like the smallest.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, trust me, you're going to barely
blow anything out, but you'll have the
[SPEAKER_15]: taste you'll experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: And more importantly, they'll get over
this real fear that isn't discussed or
[SPEAKER_15]: talked about that people have about
getting too high off of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a powerful energy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And some people, it's just too much to
take them to the moon on that rocket ship
[SPEAKER_15]: ride.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like how about hold their hand and walk
them around the coast of the ocean down
[SPEAKER_15]: the beach for the first time, and then
maybe we'll dwell into the forest and
[SPEAKER_15]: eventually, you know, climb into the
Alpine and peak the mountain.
[SPEAKER_15]: But like, holy shit, don't take them up
there for a flight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Their first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus, it also helps if, because a lot of
people that I knew that had not ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked, and I may or may not have been
introduced to them, was vaporization helps
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't like combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, vaporization, small little dab
hits, like you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporization, really makes it easy for
them to try it without, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: flipping out or anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: But let me add to this.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I have my 14 fucking things that I need
to have, to give someone a dab,
[SPEAKER_15]: my Terp slurper and my three marbles and
my fucking bong and my dabber and my temp
[SPEAKER_15]: tech and my Terp timer and my baskets and
alcohol and glass jar for cleaning all
[SPEAKER_15]: this shit and dipping it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my, you know, Q-tips and like,
dude, they have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_15]: These people have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not convenient.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absolutely ridiculous that all of us
are carrying this shit around with us at
[SPEAKER_15]: all times.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're fucking mental.
[SPEAKER_15]: Completely mental.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Marcus, with that said, man,
what are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's everybody smoking on in this
room?
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, let's bring it back.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I've got some Forum cookies cut hash
rosin from Concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've also been hitting his strawberry
banana and his cookies and cream,
[SPEAKER_15]: all of which are beautiful and tasty and
delicious.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also hit Dragonfly Earth Medicines.
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it a guava punch?
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys put it in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Josh, beautiful greenhouse and plants,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not going unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I should put that as the, as the main part
of the screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me see if I can just pin that.
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave you a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Guava.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry guava and guava punch,
but it was like a one that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some coffee in there and also a
little bit of garlic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's as nice as anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that is beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys knocked that shit out of the
park.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go buy them.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is where we grow it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our breeding house right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like over here, we've got some sis skunk
times, let's see, Zellies.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got some purple punch right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: People asked us why we did like the
offset, you know, walk through things just
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, we want like that
organic flow going, you know, we want a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of like that, you know,
just, we never know where the aisle is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_12]: And right here we have some fire glue sis
skunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have some strawberry cream cake.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Terp Wizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some Terp Wizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up, Connor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry cream cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry jelly, as I would have thought.
[SPEAKER_14]: Connor's flying into Arcata tonight and
he's going to be staying at my place for
[SPEAKER_14]: the next three days helping out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big love, Connor.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about ready to become DEM Pure
Certified out in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would like to also just shout out
the whole Michigan crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's shout out everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, you're awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone, you're awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're all freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have some coffee.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we have some coffee, great cream
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just say that this, this is that we
never have used tea in this greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: only water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only because of the way we built
the beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had like probably a almost two feet
worth of mixed Ramiel branches and chips
[SPEAKER_03]: and woods from the trees and rose bush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have some green branches and
some manure and a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of green, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lace swing right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: The lace wings are just going off in here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a mothership, which is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of our oldest strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teas are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a tea compact.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at the plants and if you look at
them and they're just flat leafed and
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy their whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you just have to give thanks to
like the mother and just let it be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish your camera was better out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those look really nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: It almost looks psychedelic and like a
half cartoon, half reality situation on my
[SPEAKER_15]: big screen here.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, uh, and just Kelly walking through
the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So good, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those strains that we're really
excited about if you can see is this fire
[SPEAKER_03]: glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was, it may have come from the
glue on fire from Steve at green life
[SPEAKER_03]: productions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big love to Steve at green life
productions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just came out amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have, uh, the fire glues
Cisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have like dominion seed company,
Duke diamond in the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Terp wizard Connor.
[SPEAKER_12]: Purples were early, beautiful finishers
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about y'all, but I'm getting
cat in mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just looking at these things.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I know I want to do like,
uh, pizza and like hash making is going to
[SPEAKER_15]: be my new like restaurant.
[SPEAKER_15]: You come in, you get pizza, but then you
got to make hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: While you're waiting for your pizza to be
a tomato sauce.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sign me up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, seeing all, like seeing all this
flower is amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like the consumers at the moment have
to buy all their herb through a dashboard
[SPEAKER_14]: and like numbers from a lab test where
we're actually like touching our plants
[SPEAKER_14]: and, and seeing them and breathing them
and living with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That experiential cannabis scene at some
point if people could come out and like
[SPEAKER_04]: take out like which plants they like and,
um, Oh, and do like a you pick or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what terpene speak out to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be something we could probably do
through soulful potentially too.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, farms in New York, they did that
with their hemp plants last year where
[SPEAKER_11]: they actually did a full and pick and pull
where people come in.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was done by veterans.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it's they're doing again this
year where they grow the plants out and
[SPEAKER_11]: then people just roll on up and they do it
as
[SPEAKER_08]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they came and were able to ask
all their questions and they make their
[SPEAKER_11]: own bomb and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Sarah Steniff and them and
their veterans out there in New York that
[SPEAKER_11]: do that much love and respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take a few nugs home, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just dry it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a couple of colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that'll last you for a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they did it by, you could either
take colas or the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people tended to take the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I love it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not surprised that people take the
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've shown a lot of people different
places to pick mushrooms, edible
[SPEAKER_15]: mushrooms, never a problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: Psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_15]: Eventually, some motherfucker goes and
digs up the mycelium with a shovel.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how like crazy it gets.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just like, dude, just like this is
just a little like I literally caught my
[SPEAKER_15]: friend digging up the entire mycelium bed
of a cyanescent patch that was a big patch
[SPEAKER_15]: in North Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just like, dude, how about leave
some for the next guy?
[SPEAKER_15]: Always leave some for the next guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, and as speaking of that, as we enter
the fall here, this is mushroom season
[SPEAKER_15]: here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the next like two plus weeks,
we'll see the semelanciata known as the
[SPEAKER_15]: liberty caps.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see the stunsies and the bale
cispans and the cyanescens known as the
[SPEAKER_15]: wavy caps.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll all start popping up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Amanita as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm not so not so interested in those
ones.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you get out into your forest and
wander around, there's some interesting
[SPEAKER_15]: things popping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to even mention all the amazing winter
chanterelles and lobsters and reiches and,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, cauliflowers and all these
incredible mushrooms that are just going
[SPEAKER_15]: to start going off in the forest here
soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really great reason to get out into
the forest.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just the gift of nature herself.
[SPEAKER_14]: We inoculate.
[SPEAKER_14]: Our straw bales that kind of line some of
our garden spaces and the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_14]: We inoculate it with kingstrafaria.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've been getting beautiful flushes
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just I love having those wine
caps around and just it's always a gift
[SPEAKER_14]: when you show up in the morning and
there's a whole other flush going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is the smile on my face when I picture
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just inoculate the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shout out to Drew from my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_15]: Inoculate the West.
[SPEAKER_15]: Inoculate the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't follow, go follow him.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome dude that's really collected an
incredible array of spore prints and the
[SPEAKER_15]: psilocybin family.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get them and acquire them and
experience them.
[SPEAKER_15]: These little aliens.
[SPEAKER_15]: Something serious.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to give a quick shout out to
our 710 crew.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, veterans, they have their own
usual they're local.
[SPEAKER_11]: So our VAC crew is our local 710 on the
hill all week and we will continue to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just FYI, we're working it hard for
everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So keep it flowing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcus, I just wanted to say thank you and
this is the coolest church I've ever been
[SPEAKER_13]: to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Haven't been to many churches.
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole cannabis journey for me has been
the catalyst to everything good.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've learned in the last 20 years all the
good people I've met.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a true honor to be here and single
source farming has just taught me to
[SPEAKER_13]: search for quality in all aspects of my
life.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the thing you said about the pizza
kind of was a fun old irony because it was
[SPEAKER_13]: like when I used to be at the spot on the
hill, it was like you couldn't even order
[SPEAKER_13]: a pizza, you know, and that was one of the
sacrifices of being up there for the
[SPEAKER_13]: summer.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you're growing your good pie.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're having your couple turns in the
greenhouse and your full term outside and
[SPEAKER_13]: you can't even order a pie when you're
tired after like a 12 hour day.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just love that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, anything where people are
really into something, they dig that deep
[SPEAKER_13]: and you make a couple fun and not so fun
sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, thank you guys all for
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't hear much from you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to tell us about sort of a
little bit of your journey and maybe some
[SPEAKER_15]: of your favorite flavors or things that
you got to Brown?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_13]: For the last decade, I was lucky enough to
rent this really cool place up in Los
[SPEAKER_13]: Padres Forest, which is like 805 Santa
Barbara area.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to all the small growers that
are still doing their thing there.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of big money that kind of
bullied our really cool, small community.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was lucky enough to go on an organic
journey because I was working for an
[SPEAKER_13]: awesome ag farm there that does the best
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they would practically give us
truckloads of compost to take up to the
[SPEAKER_13]: spot and work with.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we started making our own compost,
making our own teas, try to keep it
[SPEAKER_13]: simple.
[SPEAKER_13]: Worked on through the old slab days,
the envelope days, the parchment paper
[SPEAKER_13]: days.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a lot of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I got saved by the solvent
list.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was kind of stuck out of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then some people pushed me into some
good things and the solvent list came to
[SPEAKER_13]: life.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I realized like CRC, there was a good
thing that came from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was the tasty jars that were
lucky enough to be sitting in front of
there's obviously Addison's got this
treasure chest and sharing right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, I have some full terms in the
greenhouse that we're pulling right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a little heat wave that kind of
fucked us up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ironically, we have a wall of dragon fruit
in one greenhouse and they're just going
[SPEAKER_13]: off because we had that little tropical
thing go down.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's like 20, you know, a couple
dozen dragon fruit in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then meanwhile, we're kind of a little
trial and error this year pulling some of
[SPEAKER_13]: the Masonic here that we bought like 20
different things from him pulling them a
[SPEAKER_13]: little early and getting them frozen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did some in-house crosses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And working with those, getting them in
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then was lucky enough to pull some
depths this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're enjoying those jars today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, pretty small, pretty single
source, but just kind of keep at it so
[SPEAKER_13]: that I don't have to work for anyone else.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's been the journey.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you once again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like a great journey, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Admiral Journey.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And beautiful garden, Josh.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys just showing that whole thing,
the mountains, your back yard.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give thanks to every day is a blessing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't have to say anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hang out there half asleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I was actually just laying back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaia has a new family member, you know,
a baby in his life and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these beautiful kids and a superb wife
and everything partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm sure he got busy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we're lucky we got to see him
for the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did super thankful for Kaia Pacific
Northwest roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know online, you know,
worldwide genetics, Pacific roots,
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide genetics, just all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just a special person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the Hawaiian Aloha vibes going on
along with the Northwest, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: first nations kind of roots and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's, I love our family is
so eclectic and all over the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, no borders in our family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's, it's really cool to
hear, you know, little bits from each bio
[SPEAKER_03]: region and biosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so much love and respect for all
you all and what you're doing and putting
[SPEAKER_03]: forth good medicine to the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we're all out here just trying to
survive, putting forth good medicine to
[SPEAKER_03]: the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, it's our mission and
life, you know, so, you know, I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: really stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, you know, eight, eight,
no stopping us now, you know, nothing's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to break our stride, you know,
everything's keeping on pushing and all
[SPEAKER_03]: those good things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're steady on the grind here at
Dragonfly farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have a new grandchild in our
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had two home births on the farm,
total herbal cannabis, medicinal mushroom,
[SPEAKER_03]: herbal, you know, no, you know,
checking in with nothing, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: mother Gaia and, you know, we're thankful
for that, that mission and Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did that last summer with Kelly and
her midwifery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, you know, in a time when it can
be difficult, you know, it's sweet to see
[SPEAKER_03]: new life coming to the earth, you know,
and into our family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just gardening with your
grandchild all summer is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a level of spectacular that it's
just like, you can never explain it till
[SPEAKER_03]: you're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she loved doing tarps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are pulling tarps with the
great, you know, it's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's just a lot of good news to be had
out there, you know, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't don't get worried.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of good stuff
going on, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's these kind of people out here that
keep the inspiration going and big up to
[SPEAKER_03]: the community who's writing online,
you know, this so many people I would love
[SPEAKER_03]: to personally say their name, you know,
or have them on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just like to say the show is
just is everyone's comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show is everyone's participation.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one person is ahead or behind the
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's truly a magical, fractal team
teamwork going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, you know, everyone's invited
and everyone's on time, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for for their for their mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go do your best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we're getting getting on in
our day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have, you know, a bunch of stuff to
go tend to in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I might end up signing out
right right at this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear maybe some more things
from everyone, but just big love from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragonfly family.
[SPEAKER_03]: DEM here all the way, all the family
members, everyone else, the collective,
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone doing something good?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone doing something good?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Josh.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Kelly and the whole Dragonfly Earth
Medicine crew, they helped put this last
[SPEAKER_15]: minute hash church together.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't mind going till like noon,
you know, another 12, 13 minutes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone want to drop their social media or
the projects that they're doing or
[SPEAKER_15]: something cool about someone or point us
in the direction of someone we could be
[SPEAKER_15]: helping or we should know about whatever
it is, feel free to say it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Joshua, thanks for walking us through your
garden.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was tight.
[SPEAKER_15]: I pinned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just I figured I figured I was out
here and we could just kind of check out a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got going some pumpkin cover crops here
and some plants that have fallen over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of experience we're kind of
experimenting with like less trellising
[SPEAKER_04]: this year and keep it natural.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for these bigger gals over here,
it's probably the last trellising on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, just kind of playing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like key lime hash crosses here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some more skins just coming through.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already did a little bit of harvesting
on here, just kind of successions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some smaller plants starting to do
their fave.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we're just getting some nice
rain right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these plants will hold up nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually kind of fun to see which
ones stand up tall through all this and
[SPEAKER_04]: and kind of breed accordingly and all that
kind of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some more of the key limes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The key limes have been nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been dumping some good resin for
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with what we're still kind of
learning, like, you know, optimal
[SPEAKER_04]: harvesting for for fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I got some buddies who we've
done, you know, like cured hash with and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll see a super frosty plant be
like, oh, that one's going to dump.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I feel like for fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you feel like if you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let him get right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's looking pretty nice and ripe
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Sam, do the thials really build up at
the end of the cycle as well as the
[SPEAKER_03]: turpinoids and everything from your
experience?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is some another reason to let the
plant ripen more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you might be losing them a little
bit during cultivation, but I thought at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment of harvest seems to be when it
has the strongest smell, but then during
[SPEAKER_01]: the, say, two week in the dark drying,
it it's I mean, you can smell it for half
[SPEAKER_01]: a mile away if it's a large dry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Marcus, can I I want to give a shout
out real quick to Dean L.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brian and his victory glassworks.
[SPEAKER_11]: They gave some donations to our veterans
that we're able to use all week for our
[SPEAKER_11]: dabbing in D.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to say thank him for
helping us out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to get Brian on the show again,
maybe do another hash church about maybe
[SPEAKER_15]: it even could coincide with Sharif and
Nick and the volatile organic compounds,
[SPEAKER_15]: because not only do we want to talk about
and understand how they're produced and
[SPEAKER_15]: how they're preserved, but then if we're
so obsessed with preserving them,
[SPEAKER_15]: then too shall we be to the level that
Brian is obsessed with how we consume them
[SPEAKER_15]: and and how does the material we consume
them off of them create buffers to further
[SPEAKER_15]: preserve those compounds right up until
the point where we are experiencing them
[SPEAKER_15]: instead of changing them before they get
into our old factory and into our taste
[SPEAKER_15]: buds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Notes taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say something real quick,
Colin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get in trouble for something
today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the place, not the forum for it,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is absolutely not the forum for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just remembered that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the principle, not the fact,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what you're being convinced to
believe, sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I also do want to give a shout out to
Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade has actually become part of our
veterans group because he was a Vietnam
[SPEAKER_11]: veteran and he's been working with us and
he's been going through his cancer and
[SPEAKER_11]: he's coming out on the other side and he
gives great thanks to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it really got to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: He literally has metal in his neck,
etc.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to shout out a special
love to Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will see him this week during VAC
meetings, but he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know he sends his love and he's put on
the fight of his fight and he's coming out
[SPEAKER_11]: through it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Wade, for the strong fight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for bringing Wade up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to also reiterate that sentiment
and send my love out to Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wade, you're a special human being.
[SPEAKER_15]: We absolutely love and adore you here on
Ash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're part of our community, part of our
family.
[SPEAKER_15]: Be strong, do well.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got our support.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anytime you need it, it's always there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're looking forward to the day that
you're back enjoying Ash Church with us.
[SPEAKER_15]: So shout out to Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if he's not watching now, Ed Chan,
make sure you show him this because I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: sure we're all sending him our love.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's motivated and healing.
[SPEAKER_11]: He couldn't make it to our lobby day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we look forward to having him strong
and walking alongside us in the halls of
[SPEAKER_11]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to give some pounds to the
vets if you can help me facilitate that
[SPEAKER_13]: after the fact.
[SPEAKER_11]: Operation EVAC and Ryan Miller and them,
they do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They give away cannabis free to our
veterans and make sure of all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That man right next to you knows how to
reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I think would be
interesting to share is I've been running
[SPEAKER_05]: through, I'm going to read the list of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I-95 times cherry pie times Tony Clinton,
watermelon skittles times Z times tropical
[SPEAKER_05]: skittles times peanut butter runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Gary Payton times banana runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of those are hitting above 6% on
yield for washing, all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those that I listed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like the progenitors are correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I thought you, I know you're a fan
of Gary.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the banana, the banana runs
dads adds, adds a little twist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But banana runs is from soul fire for
those that want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've, we've got, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that stuff that you guys are put
together or that you're running right now
[SPEAKER_08]: or what's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those are in mass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for mass are you, what are you selling
most of?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you selling to the public like mass
market?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on breeding projects right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to partner with a,
there's an outfit here that we're working
[SPEAKER_05]: with to get those into licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can put those into play.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those have a, have a home for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there will be banked with
Canapedia and medicinal genomics and then
[SPEAKER_05]: backed with Paco's pathos seek,
which is their kind of pathogen kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: verification system.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the, what's the max that they'll
pay in the mass market for six star.
[SPEAKER_07]: If, if they even get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the other question.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's, it's still like,
it's still like to 2016 and you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in California, 85 plus dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the pounds are still on the,
on the, just the regulated side are still
[SPEAKER_05]: reaching three grams, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just the paradigm is still there
and it's strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's still holding somewhat,
but you'll find Rosin wholesaling for like
[SPEAKER_05]: 22 to 30 a gram, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a quarter of the price of the full now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's, it's, you know, it's not
pressing the full mouth.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're pressing mediocre.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not all the same strains though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the six star is going to be four or
five strains where like the $22 hash Rosin
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to be like eight fucking
strength, eight of the same culprit,
[SPEAKER_07]: eight of the same 16 culprits that you see
everywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like full, it's like a, you know,
mixed micron and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the East coast has a lot of like,
just in terms of like where we're at,
[SPEAKER_05]: just cause there's not a lot of
accessibility still, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we kind of forget because we're so spoiled
that we just don't have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the other thing people
are excited to learn about hash right now
[SPEAKER_05]: in the East coast or really rediscover it,
I think, honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, you know, it's like, it's,
I think it's like out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I see is a lot of product still goes
to flower market because it has value in
[SPEAKER_07]: flower market too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a little different where,
you know, and, and the reality is like
[SPEAKER_07]: West coast and the East coast smoke a lot
of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference is our Q-tips are a little
less dark on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, you know, when we clean up
our banger, it's like, cause it's
[SPEAKER_07]: different material that's going in with
more availability of super high end stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's because you have two different
forces pulling.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the market pulling to flower,
which is always viable there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just, you know, the, the
purchase, the buying market, which is kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, New York's interesting to see it
kind of turning on and just watching like
[SPEAKER_07]: pop-up stuff go from California to New
York and things happening and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But how's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you're close to that market too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what's, what do you kind of see in
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it's the kind of,
as I alluded before, I think it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone needs to just slow down and let
like the structure kind of get there,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and then we can be really truly
excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I think it's, it's just a mixture
of everybody kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting to get their chance and gearing up
for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a lot of personality,
you know, I think that's the cool part
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I'm really, honestly, I'm super
excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, it's going to be amazing and
interesting and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it's the center of many cultures.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to see what that comes with
it too, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, there's, there's been a lot of
trap and that's the, that's the one thing
[SPEAKER_07]: that seems like Daniel Boone fucking
banging out in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the last frontier though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um,
[SPEAKER_17]: there's the pushups guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody going to join me for pushups every
two hours, but yeah, there's a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I think have, uh, have, have been
doing things that want opportunity and
[SPEAKER_05]: this is their chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, um, going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's, uh, I mean, PIF doesn't
really make the greatest cash,
[SPEAKER_07]: does it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, the, all this, all of it,
um, I think again, it has to go through
[SPEAKER_05]: its own contemporary kind of the change
and all those, cause people have been
[SPEAKER_05]: holding things.
[SPEAKER_05]: For decades in these areas that have just
been growing on the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just don't want to go out and find a
new thing or buy a seed pack and take the
[SPEAKER_05]: chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they don't have the space for it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I think that's going to be
interesting and seeing kind of what,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, cause knowing just what I've
kept and been so insular with and knowing
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the other people that have been
doing the similar things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, that crossed with some of
this newer stuff that I'm now starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: explore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think is, is going to drive a lot of
what New York's going to become,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's going to be really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, I got a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to also end it here at noon.
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate everyone coming in and doing
their thing and sharing their vibe and,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, let's try and do it again next week.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe a little bit more of maybe we'll get
Sharif and we'll get Nick and we'll get
[SPEAKER_15]: deeper into the ball.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go where we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get Dr. Mark Sheldon in the house
and we'll invite some of the other
[SPEAKER_15]: regulars.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all for showing up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the road to legends now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is the road to legends.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be doing a, we'll do at least one
big legends of hash, hash church before
[SPEAKER_15]: legends as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can kind of update you on,
uh, uh, everything that, uh, Addison and
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin and the whole crew have done.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, uh, it's coming along very
nicely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also need to mention before I leave,
uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_15]: North shore cannabis presents the Kana art
event.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is September 24th from 12 to 4 PM,
uh, support local cannabis artists,
[SPEAKER_15]: get your cannabis press and THC tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that is, um, uh, trim test.
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be there with this little machine
testing, uh, testing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I'll be there future cannabis project
and, uh, rosebud farms.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be there with Che and we'll be
talking about, uh, kind of some of our
[SPEAKER_15]: products at one of the local dispensaries
in North Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had to mention that as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, legends of hash will be happening
December 2nd and 3rd of this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, we'll be, uh, yeah, come check us
out on our Instagram, uh, legends of
[SPEAKER_15]: hashish and, uh, check out the website as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Legend of hashish.com.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, I think just thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go forth and enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do want to know what percentage of
you eat pizza when you leave here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Be honest with me now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Later guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks again.
