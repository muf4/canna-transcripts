[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a nice early morning here on my way to
the Great Gardeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just sitting at the ferry terminal
waiting for the ferry to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to have a little puff and I
realized I only brought my D-nail and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of big and large.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bring a bowl for the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess what we're doing here is we're
going to make the infamous apple pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always nice to have a screen with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have quite a few of these in the car
when I roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be using, we'll use the
pencil here, broken in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to stick that through the
apple, make it so there's a bowl on one
[SPEAKER_02]: end and a little mouthpiece on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll gently work the skin away and fit
that in there and basically we'll have a
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, step one, make some juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come right out the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, get that unstuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to jam it through a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got ourselves a nice little hole and
what I usually do for this part is I
[SPEAKER_02]: usually fit the screen and just with my,
I usually use a nail but I don't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have a nail right now so we'll use the
wife's tweezers that she's got here in her
[SPEAKER_02]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just gently poke through the skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice round hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: This part is actually pretty key because
it really solidifies the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really gets the screen stuck in there
and it gives you a nice little bite of
[SPEAKER_02]: apple too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't like apple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to look something
like that and then we're going to jam our
[SPEAKER_02]: screen in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our screen is just going to sit so
flush and so lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our little mouthpiece on the
other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time to have a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got felines and lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got bubbles and baubles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got here happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open up a little oil slick because we love
those oil slicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real nice way to keep the sift in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this particular sift is from Flav421.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is his MK Ultra dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure if you can really see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a little bit dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see beautiful quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I cleaned this actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like a 99 percenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to close the oil slick balls so
it doesn't fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's really nothing left to do
but wake that bake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a few more rips and I
think we're going to jump on the ferry
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the least windy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of the least cold even though it is a
little bit windy and a little bit cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my apple pipe and my hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well have a quick little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're smoking the haoma from the Greek
gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some dry sift that he made and I cleaned
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this will be the challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get the bee line lit up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairy puppet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Must have patience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to let me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I say it's not going to let me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had to go into the smoking area
of the ferry here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little more protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just way too windy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't getting the bee line lit and it
seemed like a silly experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much easier to light the bee line here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a nice little apple rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always nice to have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that I only have four pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I keep jamming the bee line and the
liner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep losing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning bacon wakens.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a couple nice rips in the apple
pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a couple of rounds of the ferry.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if I bump into any friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check for some killer whales and dolphins
on the entrance into Nanaimo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll head on up to see the Greek
gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's continue on.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how it should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: This style is identical to none.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to make it sound like this
but you're getting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So upset that I'm wet cause you're
sweating me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys so the ferry just landed here at
departure bay in Nanaimo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got about a 20 minute drive to
Duncan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily I have someone who can drive for
me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm allowed to medicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes cause as medical marijuana patients
we're not actually allowed to medicate and
[SPEAKER_02]: then drive a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to do your medication
make sure that you have someone to drive
[SPEAKER_02]: your car for you.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tasty choice.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here just arrived at the great
gardener's.
[SPEAKER_02]: The house of the great gardener's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm about to walk inside and see Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you come with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the house of the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you man.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey you know what it's the good dirt
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half pounds lying around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always looks so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh what was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Seidman haze.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should go get the D-nail and we
should set it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright well we're going to go get the
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to set it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about some plants and
some growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about the MMPR today
and we're going to make a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So catch you guys in a bit.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so we're going to set up the
D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt's just going through a little bit of
the fresh frozen and some of the dry set
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's got hanging around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fun to go to use the cup and
it's just completely like stuffed full of
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some Ariane's haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sorts of different fun stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani, Haoma cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ariane's haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll clean that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a little of that and a little of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's golden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah I'm interested in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get some of the sweet scum.
[SPEAKER_09]: See the ones that are sieved were like the
fourth, fifth and sixth runs done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know if I had enough cardboard so
I had to go a little thicker than I
[SPEAKER_09]: normally would.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this one is?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Microplane 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one is which strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the sweet scum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sweet scum.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we try the 90?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we try the 90 he says?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we try the 90?
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we try some of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this more 90 over here or 45?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's 45.
[SPEAKER_09]: Microplane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microplane and coming off the cardboard
nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chunks over here at the end sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop those first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: That one is a little bit lighter eh?
[SPEAKER_09]: The 90 is lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the proper color now it was kind of
blue there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's have a rip of that hey?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get that up there.
I
[SPEAKER_10]: found thee.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe for the next set after?
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe for the next one.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up next on the off and block?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to make a little snake up
there on that ceramic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to place it on my email.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a darn good plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard not to make snakes with hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've got good hash you just kind of
want to get it in your fingers a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rolling up the hashish.
[SPEAKER_10]: India styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to put it on the ceramic
dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little ceramic dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks darn fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's see your steez.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to get it on there without
burning myself?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah you can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have faith in you.
[SPEAKER_10]: See the tips are bubbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slow and steady wins the race.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably so tasty.
Your turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: 770 degrees on the quartz nail with the
ceramic insert equals tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you saying about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a super flavorful orangey orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to compete with that flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that was the 99 one either.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_09]: No I think that was just what comes off
the trimmer table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is still quite clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like probably 85.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll clean that one and then we'll
compare it to a 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so I'm going to take a little of
that rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: While he's waiting for the ceramic to cool
down he wants to do the test on the I
[SPEAKER_02]: think the first one was just his lightly
bounced very gently seed collection type
[SPEAKER_02]: of thing over screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Single screen and he got some incredible
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: 85% heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that and cleaned it up to a 99% and
we're just going to show you the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now one thing about the great gardener's
strains is they do not lack flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so tasty dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the hayoma, to the Afghani,
to the barb, that sweet scone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean they're all just so delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could even tell you how many strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is unbelievable flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: We went through and then it's just the
best of the best over the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the thousands of members that have
sampled the strains and told us yes that
[SPEAKER_09]: one works for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the super flavorful ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not necessarily the 20% TAC.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that number has really no sort of
validity.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it has a small place.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a small place as one indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's been a bit of a deceiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like now with people like oh I want a
strain with just CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we really don't understand the
full effects of the cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_02]: and how it affects us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's one thing to say oh it had a
certain percentage of something and then
[SPEAKER_02]: just assume that that's the thing that was
helping you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When really it could be that well but what
about all these volatile oils that
[SPEAKER_02]: modulate and what about the different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add terpenoids into the mix and it's
huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are finding that now with terpenes
and terpenoids from other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mersene from mango is a popular one.
[SPEAKER_02]: People being able to experiment on their
own to sort of try and modulate your
[SPEAKER_02]: effects that you're getting from smoking
by just eating a mango or two before you
[SPEAKER_02]: take a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely something to be said for
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to be said for that and I think
once we get the terpenoid profiles done
[SPEAKER_09]: and we start understanding the differences
in there and that someone comes in to a
[SPEAKER_09]: club and they're looking for a specific
terpene.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not looking for the CBD anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for the alpha toluene.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe in a combination of two.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I think the government's
getting it wrong with not allowing
[SPEAKER_09]: extracts because this right here and this
stuff right here is the medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_09]: This here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This here that's legal has the medicine on
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the messenger.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a plant material that you
don't need.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need the plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you need is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you need is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would kind of be like apples being
illegal but you can have apple trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can go to sit down at a food
store and buy an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take those apples off and like
make like an apple crisp.
[SPEAKER_09]: No it's like them telling you that you
have to eat the whole apple tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to let us use the apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't take the apple off and eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to eat the whole tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the fight we're fighting here
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've allowed us to have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really understand that what we
want about cannabis is the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much like when you order pizza you open
the box and take the pizza out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine you were being told that you had
to also consume the box and that to take
[SPEAKER_02]: the pizza out of the box would actually be
a crime.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other analogy right now is the MMPR.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the MMPR is saying that you have to
buy from a commercial establishment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially that's like saying you can no
longer cook food at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to go to a restaurant and buy
your food for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty good analogy actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: No more cooking at home because why?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're using power.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're using 220 power on your stove.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause of fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many fires are caused by stoves?
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should ban them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make everybody go to a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_09]: See how that works.
[SPEAKER_09]: People can't grow their own medicine?
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can grow my own tomato.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can make my own beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make my own wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not opposed to them having
tomatoes available.
[SPEAKER_02]: A grocery store is a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have a large scale.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem with the large scale.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is that they're taking the
personal rights away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost in our last month here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right around the corner in the next day I
guess we're going to be in the March.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we're in the March that gives us
31 days before we find out about our
[SPEAKER_02]: injunction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find out whether we're going to abide
by the law and destroy all of our cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: mixing it with kitty litter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether we're going to say no we can't
abide by this law and continue to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because many are going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other option is that we win
this injunction and that everything stays
[SPEAKER_02]: as is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The MMPRs still come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to hurt their business for
the little guy to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the injunction still is just a kicking
the can down the road.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It kicks the can down the road and gives
us six months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully we get the injunction and then
John wins.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Kirk wins.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of fights out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one guy out there that his daily
limit is higher than 150 grams.
[SPEAKER_09]: He is not even allowed to order his daily
limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see they've got a few little
things that are... It's just a few little
[SPEAKER_02]: things that they change.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing could just be fine and no one
would have a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a problem with large
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I even say the little guy,
I'm even talking about guys like Matt and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a gargantuan grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This grows a good amount of medicine for a
decent amount of people, but by no means
[SPEAKER_02]: would it ever produce enough medicine for
a proportion of Canada's medical or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people look at this and they see
your grow and they just think,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just so huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not huge when you talk about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you talk about this, it's not huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a huge endeavor by means.
[SPEAKER_09]: Acres and acres should be under glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be being grown everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from the prairies.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do things big in the prairies,
it's not acres and it's not hectares.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: A section is basically like a mile by a
mile, which is interesting because in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada it's kilometers, but I'm certain
even our farmers follow sections as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still use... A mile by a mile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big section of land to be growing
urban.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to hit this little guy,
I'll get the camera up close for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a few things to do today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to walk through the garden,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 micron sweet skunk bubble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me that 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is bubs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what you gave me the other day was...
Is that bubs?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that would have been dry stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it was pressed, if it had
easily been strewed as.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was at the Vancouver Seat Bank and
I pressed that out and it smoked a bunch
[SPEAKER_09]: of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rebecca and the crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rebecca and the crew at the Vancouver Seat
Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're located on Hastings Street in
between...
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Closer down to my shop near Clark than
from the BCMP, like CCHQ, vapor management
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Google it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver Seat Bank.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great Canadian seeds, great Canadian
value.
[SPEAKER_09]: And trustworthy people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Vancouver Seat Bank.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think within the next couple of days,
great gardener, apparel website will be
[SPEAKER_09]: up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be able to get t-shirts,
t-shirt like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the hoodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoodies, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott's hoodie really inspired me to get
off my ass and make a bubble man hoodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_09]: These ones are a couple.
[SPEAKER_09]: These ones got iPhone pockets inside the
pockets.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do the coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got another one around here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be on your website?
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be on the website.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the gray long sleeve.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got that guy on there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: G.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless, great gardener.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta have it.
[SPEAKER_09]: G.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_09]: G.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_09]: Couple other goodies on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stickers, lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we're talking and hoping that
Matt is going to join us in Spain for
[SPEAKER_02]: spandibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not sure if he's going to be able to
make it happen, but he's definitely going
[SPEAKER_02]: to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben, that would just be great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, have you been?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a couple of times too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Sunday.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last day, you go in and you can tell
that there's been a party.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flyers are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you've been at an old rave.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50,000 people have walked in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the entrance, it's almost like the
entrance to the Louvre in Paris.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got this big glass pyramid that's
just sort of right at the entrance into
[SPEAKER_02]: the venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No hassles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smoke away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're going to pop a few more
bowls here and then Matt's going to...
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the save.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the save?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we always put the lids back
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that one, this one here, had just done
that, I'd be on the ground crying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm crying right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not us.
[SPEAKER_02]: God is that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That almost has a cat piss smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that is dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got it planed up to almost perfection
with just the slightest tiniest little
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces that are a little bit bigger and
they have this purple-esque color compared
[SPEAKER_02]: to everything else which is white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it melts into an absolute
complete liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll make sure we get you a macro
shot of this particular hash melting so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really just liquefies and turns this
golden color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit 23 more of those and
we'll get into the garden with Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to head upstairs to
one of the bloom rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt's already up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: True light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can-a-tonic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can-a-tonic room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well this looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to shoot it with the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some can-a-tonic.
[SPEAKER_09]: This room was destined for room number two
but because the MMAR is over at the end of
[SPEAKER_09]: March, we had just decided to flower out
the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Some nice little trikes on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is full can-a-tonic?
[SPEAKER_09]: Full can-a-tonic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do as much can-a-tonic as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess when you grow what the
patients want, people are going to ask for
[SPEAKER_02]: the can-a-tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got eight lights in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight lights.
[SPEAKER_09]: The room's only like just over seven feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have everything lifted quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost three feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's on three gallons.
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost three feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not very.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so nice to see buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little ones sneaking out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the can-a-tonic that we used in
all the crosses to make a whole new line
[SPEAKER_09]: of high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go downstairs and we can actually
check some out in the other room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're flowering the final phenotype
selections.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have a look at those.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really interesting.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: High CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess good for anti-seizure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-seizure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Arthritis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You name it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: The CBD on the healing chart incorporates
about 80% of the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the major symptoms you go for are
what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Pain relief.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-spasticity.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Appetite stimulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great looking herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys are in week four or five.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably put them on water for the
final four.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four weeks of water.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice flush.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to get that out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're not yellow, if the fan leaves
aren't yellow, I guess they could be
[SPEAKER_09]: purple and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Certain strains go certain colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: But definitely not overly deep,
dark green.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want the dark greens in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That dark green is just an indication that
the nutrients are still within the plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want those leaves to turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the indication that the nutrients
are not in the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's some nice trikes there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I had one more year, I think the entire
line available would be all high CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: High CBD afghani, digweed, high CBD sweet
skunk, high CBD rennet, high CBD jangui.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring in flavors and bring in what the
people love already and adding the high
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just putting the high CBD into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a profile people are appreciating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not produce it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a mix of the cannabinoids and the
terpenoids on the strains that are already
[SPEAKER_09]: recognized as medicinal strains and just
adding a more medicinal aspect for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a winning combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Renet BD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see where the wand plant is
getting a little bit too much light.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kicking out weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that few buds right beside it that
are lower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not far away, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the difference of four inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four to six inches, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see a few of them spattered around
the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all in exactly the same spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what it is is not A, they're
getting the light that comes directly off
[SPEAKER_09]: the bulb, but B, they're getting the light
that reflects off the shade and from the
[SPEAKER_09]: other side.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just that magic little zone that
there's not much you can do about it.
A
[SPEAKER_10]: little tour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some fatties, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just leaking out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesomeness everywhere here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_10]: So hard to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I need a special... You take still
shots and stuff?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: 22 megapixel camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually substantial.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys will get huge in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking like they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have four weeks, two or three.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: They still have probably five,
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 weeks, sometimes 11.
[SPEAKER_09]: Push it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I guess you'll see some variations in
the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think they'll all be around?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that you see this structure and you
see how it takes off like this,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's interesting because when we go down
and you see the Afghani Kanatonic,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I have two different phenotypes down
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm after is the Afghani phenotype,
which I actually happen to have on the
[SPEAKER_09]: next table.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can look at the Afghani and now that
you've seen what this Kanatonic looks like
[SPEAKER_09]: when you see the one Afghani Kanatonic
cross down there, you'll see that it's
[SPEAKER_09]: more on the Kanatonic side and it's not
what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking for the Afghani traits with
the high CBD to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We think we've gotten pretty close on it,
especially with the Renae.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was showing you a little earlier there.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Renae is a very nice candidate for...
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcohol-soluble terpenes.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll get the macro lenses out and do
a little bit of trichol macro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grabbing wires.
Always
[SPEAKER_02]: happy to be in a beautiful room with
blooming plants, resin, approximately 1.8
[SPEAKER_02]: trillion resin glands on these particular
tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: I counted them myself earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not the most accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm going to get the macro lens
out and show you a little closer up on
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on on these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Thanks for watching.
