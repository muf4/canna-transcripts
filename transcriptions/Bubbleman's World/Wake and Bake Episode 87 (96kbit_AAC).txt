[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the wake and bake episode 87.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having a fun little conversation in
the chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sticks with Terps was like, oh,
I like your legends of hash church you got
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, how the fuck does he know I
have a legends of hash church on this
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking trip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he was seeing the photo,
the avatar that I changed yesterday in the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you guys want to have a little bit of
a nerve wracking sickening moment with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, not long after the amazing all
woman hash church panel, I went to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just said error.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't access this account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started going into my phone and I
went into my computer and I went in on my
[SPEAKER_01]: other computer and it just it wasn't
really working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of working like I could I
could go into a page that had YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: opened already and I could push play on
the video and it was a play.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you, nerve wracking happened
again this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a little Google and found out that
YouTube's having a little bit of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how sick I felt of the
idea of losing my channel, of losing my
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to come and hang out with you guys
every morning, of losing that all female
[SPEAKER_01]: hash hash church panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sick to my stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God I googled quickly and found out
YouTube is indeed fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got 107 people watching,
113, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It jumps, it drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: 908, we've been live for a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're just you should download
and archive all your videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Brett Armstrong, most of my videos
are archived because I produced them by
[SPEAKER_01]: editing them and I have all the raw
footage, the edited footage, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, wake and bake episodes and
anything that I do live like hash church,
[SPEAKER_01]: those need to be saved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be doing some saving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also ask you the public,
if you have your favorite episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: go and rip it off of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be appreciative because if we
lose all these hash churches, wouldn't it
[SPEAKER_01]: be nice to have someone say, I have them,
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got some time and I'm going to
try and rip as many as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have the first 30 or 36 or so,
but I need to rip the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, Chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a classic, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only Barcelona legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I got sick to my stomach and
couldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed up and yeah, Jebediah Haney,
we know it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash church episode yesterday was one
of the best hash church episodes ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those women did a stand up job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They crushed the men, in my opinion,
not in regards to their knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: their information, but how they went about
sharing it, how compassionate they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: To one another, how they allowed each
other to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, B Beacher?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought it was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned from it and I'm going to step up
my game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to allow these strong male
personalities to walk all over hash church
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to offend people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the minute I start giving
people a little kind of like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, it's not cool to tell
everyone we owe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really cool to tell everyone that
you, you know, like just the little things
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of the panel members have done
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to be, I don't think Prana
is available in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to be a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to be, get the exposure
that they require at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to turn into just about
that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm having a little bit of problems
with a few people who seemingly can't talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about anything other than themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand how most of us are talking
about ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times, but you know,
try to step out sometimes, try to have
[SPEAKER_01]: empathy for the person talking and put
yourself in their shoes and listen to them
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than to try and, you know,
get something off of your, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like crush the person with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see some of our more mature
members, you know, be as kind and
[SPEAKER_01]: compassionate as the ladies were because
my God, they were classy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a class act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the stuff that was being in
chat was unfortunate, was being said in
[SPEAKER_01]: chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: How guys just can't seem to deal with
powerful, beautiful, articulate women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a small, a few guys that
just couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had to say stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had to say, you know,
things that were coming from their
[SPEAKER_01]: insecurities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I, I let Sal go on one
that definitely hurt one of the panelists'
[SPEAKER_01]: feelings when he said something,
you know, that was, it was hurtful and it
[SPEAKER_01]: made this girl feel really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was probably because he's insecure
and upset and maybe he's older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have nothing against you,
Sal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were by no means the worst ones
because I let you go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people got banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, come on, we have some
ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our mothers and our sisters and
our grandmothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you around those women?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you not, if it's off topic and doesn't
interest you, then split taste buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to say negative shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was off topic at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they stayed on topic the entire
time and talked about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what Hash Church is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's sad to see, super sad to see
these sort of sexual insecurities or
[SPEAKER_01]: intimidations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank them for coming out
and I'm going to definitely have many of
[SPEAKER_01]: those ladies on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not true taste bud 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those women do make Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I've made Hash with some of those
women.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine how wrong you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not about making Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those people are helping people
palletively die the end of their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those people are teaching people
about cannabis that are elderly and in old
[SPEAKER_01]: age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in my opinion, it was fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised you're here actually
defending that it wasn't awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was really top notch and Hash
Church is not all about making Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not, you know, and those were
women, not girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a different girls and
boys are children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Men and women are adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilary Black's an absolute legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's awesome person.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think girls hate Sal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sal just got a little
uncomfortable and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean we have to now bash on
Sal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the mentality of a chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you what, you guys are an
incredible chat room because I've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: around lately and I looked at some of
these YouTube live videos that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, the Mayweather, the Conor McGregor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy Christ was that negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I found live Simpsons and family
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see the worst YouTube
comments you could ever possibly imagine,
[SPEAKER_01]: go look up a live Simpsons or a live
family guy and watch like 10 minutes of
[SPEAKER_01]: the chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me feel sick to my stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt sad for these people that they were
creating this energy amongst themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting, you are a very fucking cool
chat room, nine inch colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we owe it to ourselves because we want
to hang out with cool people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to wake up and piss each
other off and fight with one another and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why Sal, today, you are the winner,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give you a t-shirt if you
tell me what size you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to tell you that I'm not bitching
about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying, you were used as an
example of what was going on yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you will allow me to, Sal,
I would love to send you a t-shirt today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got small, I've got large,
I've got double extra large.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like you, Sal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you say a lot of cool things in
the room and I definitely don't want you
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave the room or not be a part of our
group because we enjoy what you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer and what you share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it was unfortunate that one of the
things you said yesterday really pissed
[SPEAKER_01]: off my good friend and made her feel bad
about herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't want to, we don't want
to make people feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know if I have the extra
large, Sal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might have taken the extra
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's an extra large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got three times extra large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got small, I got three times extra large
and large.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other option, Sal, is that I
could send you a pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather have a pin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could send you a nice Karma Cup pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could send you one that says,
are you elite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I could send you one that says Karma
Cup, but I don't have your size shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel bad about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he says he's an extra large,
but I only have large and three times
[SPEAKER_01]: extra large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three times is really big, but I guess you
could always shrink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got here, Sal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like the biggest shirt ever?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pretty big shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send it to you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can shrink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, Sal, if you don't mind
sending me your email, sorry, address,
[SPEAKER_01]: actual address so I can send you that
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is bcbubbleman at iCloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he said three times extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be so sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to sometimes realize that
little things that we might punch into the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen can actually make people feel
terrible about themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know your vision isn't to come into
the chat room and make someone feel bad
[SPEAKER_01]: about themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we might not understand when
we're speaking from our insecurities and
[SPEAKER_01]: not our heart, that the same way when we
speak from our heart and we can touch
[SPEAKER_01]: someone and they can be humbled by it and
they can really appreciate the empathy,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite the opposite when we come from
our insecurities and we shoot something
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a dagger or like a razor blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, my friend's bleeding on
her arm, holding herself in the corner
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, oh, that guy, he did this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's try to keep it positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to keep each other positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone's negative, I think it's OK
for us to turn it around and go into it
[SPEAKER_01]: and discuss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if someone's a troll and their whole
means and impression is to just come here
[SPEAKER_01]: and hijack the conversation and to try and
hijack it into a more negative,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the bandhammer is like in full
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just get rid of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: 917 and only 147 viewers in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually have a couple of hundred by
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of surprised, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's time for a little viking
bikies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Sal didn't even say the
worst thing, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: All he said was that he was happy that
someone else was going to talk that talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about something other than sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend who brought up sex,
well, it was hard for her to bring that
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: She felt like she was really kind of
putting herself out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we put ourselves out
there, we don't want to get we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get smacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to get hammered except the
trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trolls fucking love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Sean, so YouTube is acting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: My channel disappeared a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to go into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to start the video and it was
completely gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shatting my pants a little bit,
shatting my pants just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sex is a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is sex a hot topic, it's a topic
none of the guys have ever covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guarantee you, if we did,
we'd have a hard time doing it as mature
[SPEAKER_01]: as the women did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those women did it great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really was Lester.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I recommend you to clean your
quartz?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I use DC glass cleaner, but I'm
smoking out of sapphire today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't use it on sapphire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sharted myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings, Ron Jones from Pendleton,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what pisses people off from
Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're from Canada and you call it
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, some of them do not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you want an argument,
don't do it in chat on HashChurch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to promote your products and
you want to promote yourself and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone to answer, you're getting a
million people asking you questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: go do it in another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them your emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cool to take up the HashChurch
room for your personal sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been so uncomfortable telling the
people that are doing things that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like because I don't want to step on
anyone's toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gloves are off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone needs to step the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the sapphire.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it cannot handle any quick temperature
change like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selena was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very empathetic and compassionate girl
doing good job out there in the Okanagan.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them really, all of them really
were amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Rosie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought she was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was really articulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just dabbed on some God's green
crack minus a turp dip, which is crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have many turps that I went and
picked up the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and picked up some Covella sour
diesel and I went and picked up some
[SPEAKER_01]: Clementine from Blue River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also picked up the lemon tree,
my last vial of lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I picked up some sour tangy because I
fucking love sour tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a very, very nice person,
like very her and Hillary are kind of on
[SPEAKER_01]: par for just how kind and considerate they
are in this scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Mike Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just talking a little bit about all
the turps on the God green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, green crack is a pretty
classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: God is very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to get the terpene profile
for God bud, because it has this soapy,
[SPEAKER_01]: strange terpene mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the tiniest little bit about it,
but but not quite what you get from just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm you know, I'm a bigger fan of
exotic narrow leaf drug cult of our
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the ones I prefer the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I think about Back to the Future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you grew up in the 80s,
you're fucking loving that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even watching them recently with my kids
was kind of enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to say?
Nice emcee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be smelling your Blue
River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get it in the mail,
I'll tell you one time Tony sent me some.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a four point five ml vial,
which is a large bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have one just to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But well, actually, you know, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was one of these full of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's luckily we use these pouches that
we use because they're sealed inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and so one of them came broken,
smashed into a million pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the terpenes were just liquid in the
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I opened the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I poured the terpenes out of the fresh
thing and I lost maybe three drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty, pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I will be bringing any
bubble man brand Mike Quinn, but I will be
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing Blue River terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to get your terpenes on,
I should buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then have the new Jamaican cultivars
that are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We produced 400 mls.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can imagine, that's a lot of
terpenes like a big friggin jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be releasing those in
the near future on Blue River Canada's
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you Canadians that want to try out
the Jamaican terpenes, they're coming your
[SPEAKER_01]: way soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much sold out of the other
Jamaican terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little bit left, but I'm down for
a rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that are going to buy
terpenes, use the code Blue River all
[SPEAKER_01]: lowercase 2 0 1 7 Blue River 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to give you 30% off of your
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trust me, it will be appreciated
because these terps are cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Karma Cup, actually, seeing as
though we're speaking it, they have till
[SPEAKER_01]: the 28th.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 11 more days if you're entering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are entering the Karma Cup,
please get them the entries to them on
[SPEAKER_01]: time before the 28th.
[SPEAKER_01]: of this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're entering a solventless
product, a dry sift or a bubble hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: even a rosin, I will look forward to
smoking your product because I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I get to be like a celebrity judge or
a special guest judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just a judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm putting myself higher than I
really belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to be a judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm asking you is for any of you
out there that want to partake,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see your hashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Sarah would love to see your buds,
your hash, your pens, your solvent,
[SPEAKER_01]: your solventless, all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I would just like to see your
solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't enter, come by my booth
and let's have a dab out of the ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I get that caught in the sorry,
Jeff, I free getting phone calls getting
[SPEAKER_01]: my mothership whip caught in the drawer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to call I free back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good brother for mine that I met
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually my friend that introduced me
to kid his eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mad props.
[SPEAKER_01]: This this rip is for Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted recently a post on Facebook about
how the energy of Rastafari has brought
[SPEAKER_01]: the most incredible amazing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt bad that I didn't have a good
photo of Jeff to post because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely one of the influences in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting me in Kingston, introducing me to
kid is and well, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mark is kind of correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: An endomide Asher in a sense, except that
once you get the terpenes extracted the
[SPEAKER_01]: way we do it, there's zero footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no way of actually proving
that it comes from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a profile that has zero
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only legal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had ours tested at a few
different borders by a few different law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't come up with any
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's literally no footprint sharing
that this is a cannabis product other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that and then the gray areas that
we're allowed to do the extraction because
[SPEAKER_01]: we have licensing and permits to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we create a product that's almost like
this leftover product that is no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal because there's no way on proving
that it came from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Canada, it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federally, I can produce terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a license and a permit to process
and yeah, they shop anywhere in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sell in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not part of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the Canadian distributor,
which means I get to sell in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys seen the Harmony Whitney
Harmony one with a little fritted glass in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I support psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking love psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab a doodle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud rich only to reciprocal countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I get my permit in Jamaica as a
patient, I should be able to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth from Jamaica with product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are things that are happening
here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reciprocity is not going to happen
overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, no go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still working on it, mine's inclined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been talking to a few different companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been talking to Brian from Vytal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been talking to Forever Flower and
Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even had a conversation with Reefer Man
who apparently has quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those Japanese pieces are next
level, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are completely next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's doing shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are literally from another
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really look at what they're
doing, they're deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using detail like the same thing
that I became well known for, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming OCD about hash isolation and
isolating it to the absolute cleanest that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photographing skunk man sans isolations
and showing them to people and having them
[SPEAKER_01]: be like jaw on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like these Japanese guys
have done the same thing with glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've just taken this thing that's
existed for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people have been doing incredible
work, but then they purified it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got it so concentrated and so small
and so macro that it's just you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't scoop that piece,
Samuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That piece will be like $100,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a photographer who gets to shoot a
lot of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I scooped that piece, I'd be puffing it
all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this piece, I absolutely scooped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks to Corey for the custom mug
for bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking love this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't show you too much of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'll spill my water all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asians are true artisans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I don't, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty huge generalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a large group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big chunk of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some Asian people are absolutely
incredible artisans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Japanese guys from Team Japan,
Yoshi, Junichi, and Daisuke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are absolutely incredible
artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dosa too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humbled to be in their presence while
they're doing their technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Smash Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asians.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of Asians in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is cock Asians of which apparently I
am a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why we're cock Asians.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a weird thing, but it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All more ways to divide people that are
all just people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely yabba gabba doe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I will say at one point in time
in my life, I was potentiating my
[SPEAKER_01]: stereotype to the most accurate fucking
potential you could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big dready hair, listening to Fish and the
Grateful Dead, driving the orange
[SPEAKER_01]: Volkswagen van, smoking reefer,
eating mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just literally playing frisbee golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so like an absolute fucking
stereotype to the stereotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wearing fucking Guatemala printed pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the whole nine yards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm a little more chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: One specie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human specie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, frisbee golf, Jephro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to love frisbee golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my God, how wonderful was that if
you were someone that loved to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: joints and see parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never the only white guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been in a few places in my life
where there's only been a few of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm good with that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I do feel like a weird insecurity
and this is a kind of a funny white person
[SPEAKER_01]: insecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, when I'm in a hot country,
I already know that I have the wrong skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had the ability, especially because
I'm very sensitive to the sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I had the ability to change the level
of whatever it is in my skin, melanin,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the protein is in your skin that
controls the lightness and the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had the ability to turn my skin very
dark while I was in hot countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do it every time because my skin
is fucked when I'm in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to stay out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pigment then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, if I could fucking turn
myself like black, like darkness black
[SPEAKER_01]: while I was in the tropics, so I could go
out in a field and photograph for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Jamaican farmer friends are out in that
field for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can honestly tell you if I did that,
I would be in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the wrong skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now if I went up to the up north
and now you're in colder environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, this skin works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dude, Daniel, I am a redhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, without having red hair,
I am basically a redhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I burn in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do sun grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had them down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent six to eight weeks at a time
down there, so I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know why I said,
well, I didn't say melatonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I said melanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I misplaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably be close to that,
though, if I go and look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just turn red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brutal, especially because I want to
spend a lot of time in the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to spend time flying my drone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do macro photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take real photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to just spend time being
in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these fields are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out and open.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not so much melanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Melatonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you take that so you can go to
sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one sixteenth ginger in my beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get melty, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's how it happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am looking forward to going down to
Jamaica and filming some footage of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, of the processing facility,
of the bottling and packaging plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: of like all the different sort of things
that are now fitting together as we come
[SPEAKER_01]: together on this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could sail a boat down there and
live, that would be dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you probably could, sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I met some people down there in
the 90s that were doing just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Terry, who had the boat,
he had a catamaran called the Lion of
[SPEAKER_01]: Judah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he lived off the coast of the grill
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at 580 right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excellent, Ivan Martos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have her watch the story of
Hillary telling the story of her 101 year
[SPEAKER_01]: old grandma getting turned on to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if any of you guys saw that
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known her grandma probably since she
was like 82 or 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a fairly long time, maybe even longer,
almost 20 years anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: What criteria do you use when looking for
property?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Earthling, I'm not too worried about
property myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually the farmer and a few other
people, I'm a processor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my processing office, my lab,
wherever our lab, I should say,
[SPEAKER_01]: because Tony processes with me,
it can kind of go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really care as long as we have
some power, as long as we have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are the things that are
most important for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it really doesn't matter where
the field itself is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you ask that question to our
grower, well, he would answer things like
[SPEAKER_01]: access to water, vicinity, proximity to
the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is it a stupid like hike into
the bush 40 minutes?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's old school prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to pull trucks up right next to
the field and have it like right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the ones that are going to be
the future of cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to climb into the mountains
in Jamaica anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the prohibition mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to plant five acres of
peanuts so that if the police catch you in
[SPEAKER_01]: the forest near your ganja field,
you can walk them to the peanuts and say
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're a peanut farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do that anymore in
Jamaica either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really looking forward, Jamaica's got
that sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got that water, the sun and the water
are the two things that they can really,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone can afford in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuban chronic, I'm hitting a bubble hash
rosin right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, John, Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wouldn't say he wrote that song
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he writes songs for everybody,
but I'm a character in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to share through song.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he wrote a song, not about me,
but about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned him on to dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned in the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go see Reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's loving the hat today.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he look properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wake and baked or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Melty Heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Four Corners, I don't know what to
tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know those songs that cannabis
specialist, John Mason, Luton fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: all doing the full melt rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty awesome too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite lines from
originists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the word dabbing started out with
a bad reputation, especially when I came
[SPEAKER_01]: out and started dabbing hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought dabs was V.H.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: People thought dabs were V.H.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what we did since then is we
opened it up to the fact that dabs are
[SPEAKER_01]: much more than just V.H.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, you know, isolated cannabinoids
and terpene profiles from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you not love dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if your dabs are soaked in chemical
solvents and mercapitan oil soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants that are present in the
particular solvent you use, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not awesome at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do I have to open the tiny chat?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you could just go there and it's
always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did what term originate,
Bud Rich?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did what term originate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure who first said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that my friends were dabbing back
in the 90s with oil when they created the
[SPEAKER_01]: mare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of the thumbnails on the
videos are picked automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just choose them and randomly
generate three thumbnails and choose one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll go in and I'll pick a
different of the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the odd time I'll go in and I'll
create a custom thumbnail and make that
[SPEAKER_01]: the thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I don't choose a thumbnail and I
go make, say, a live video that hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: gone live yet, it'll show my avatar from
the top page of the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, a new person would come
on Hash Church and it would be them who
[SPEAKER_01]: was the avatar and I wasn't doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, holy shit, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to find out from Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're releasing any pumpkin
spice flavor now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot knives are two original dabs from the
80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Waters, my friends even took it up a
step higher because they created this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing called the mare.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were the guys from the Kootenays
known as the Holy Smokes Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: My old friends, Dustin Sunflower,
Paul de Feliz and Alan Middleness.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys were constantly, they had held
down Nelson, B.C., which is like a fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: large, like a small little town,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like near the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can imagine throughout the 90s,
a lot of people would just take weed
[SPEAKER_01]: because they grew beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like our humble to our
northern California for British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kootenays is known for growing
exceptional cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would walk that cannabis across
the border because it was so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had known these trails for a long,
long time, whether you wanted to go on a
[SPEAKER_01]: quad or whether you wanted to just walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take a backpack with you,
walk across and you could turn your
[SPEAKER_01]: fifteen hundred pounds into like thirty
five hundred dollars or three thousand or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people were doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Holy Smokes guys, they were not
smugglers, but they were the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: activists of Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were constantly in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were constantly defending themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they created this thing years ago
called the mare, like the mare of the
[SPEAKER_01]: city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a propane torch and bent
over the propane torch was a spoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a stainless steel spoon that was like
like clamped to the neck of the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you turn the torch on,
it would just be hitting the spoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over top of the spoon,
they had a glass bell that fit over top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the spoon and went down into a tube that
went into a pipe, a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was called the mare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how Breeder Steve got turned on
to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how like many, many people in
the 90s here in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: got turned on through those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bald faced logic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson's amazing for anyone that skis or
snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fucking backcountry place,
of course, made quite famous by Travis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do do do do do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but a lot of knives have a chemical
coating you shouldn't inhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, listen, these weren't nobody saying
that this was the good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a whole bunch of stupid shit back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I'm going to
participate on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Atomic Skier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an email asking to be on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote them back saying I'd love to be on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard back.
[SPEAKER_01]: From them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I talked to him a little briefly in
this show and he thought I had a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with him and I assured him I had no
problem with him whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, if I hear from him and I have
time on Friday, I'll go on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sifter, wet sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the answer is whatever you choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no right answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is no right answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, 235 people glad to caught up to
our regular numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to be heading into the city
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to go check out the Turp Mansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winds of West or Winds West if you check
them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I should probably give you the
right account just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there he is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is Winds West.
[SPEAKER_01]: W-I-N-D-S-W-E-S-T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently they're visiting in from the
Okanagan right now and they've got a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of heady pieces over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought maybe I go film a little bit,
puff some bowls and see what was what.
[SPEAKER_01]: May happen, may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to go to the tiny chat app.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time today to do tiny chat,
but I'm pretty sure I don't have to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: there for it to be open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys can just go and it's
always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try my best, Stix, but more likely I
will go live on my phone depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome the Turp Mansion is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we gave a shirt away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We puffed some bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sal, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: lbcbubbleman at icloud.com and I will send
you that triple XL shirt, my brother,
[SPEAKER_01]: and no hard feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope all is well with you and yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that, well, how would I say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Peace out, everybody.
Peace out, everybody.
Peace out, everybody.
