[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Marley's birthday here in Kingston,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is raining just beautifully.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice little appearance from Bob.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks Bob.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything needs water.
[SPEAKER_18]: You were down there, Fliega?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I got wet in the rain up there.
[SPEAKER_18]: But you were down at the museum?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And how was it?
It was alright, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's down there?
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're performing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Artists performing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I talked to the Nomads.
[SPEAKER_18]: They said at 4 o'clock they're going on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Between 4 and 8, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, brother man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, Ashley?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good day, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Better buck and believe it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sun is shining.
[SPEAKER_09]: Weather is sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like it's the Honorable Robert Nesta
Marley's birthday today.
[SPEAKER_09]: His Earth Strong would have been number 70
for Bob today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course we all still celebrate it
like he's here with us because,
[SPEAKER_09]: lo and behold, I can hear his voice right
now in the background.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to head on over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got Pele with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to head over to Bob's birthday
bash.
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, you literally are a cross.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can get off the license.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can get off the license.
I can get
[SPEAKER_05]: off the license.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can get off.
[SPEAKER_07]: No man, no man, no man, no
[SPEAKER_07]: man.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that go for it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, wow, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going right now, are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to ring someone right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was supposed to ring you,
but I can stop and chat with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: What it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you are, Tony.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK,
[SPEAKER_09]: so we are here at 56 Hope Road,
Kingston, Jamaica with my good friend
[SPEAKER_09]: Jakob Grant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met several years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're now working with Henry Lowe in the
Medecanja.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sure CRD and UCAN will be
talking to you guys in the near future
[SPEAKER_09]: about that business.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for today, today's business is just
for us to enjoy the birthday of the
[SPEAKER_09]: Honorable Robert Nesta Marley.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have been his 70th Earth Strong
birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not would have, it is his 70th Earth
Strong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard his voice singing multiple
times throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, let's take a little walk and show
them what's up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to come check us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's gonna break it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's gonna break it?
Who's gonna break it?
[SPEAKER_09]: About the mothership here, had to make an
appearance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock it up.
Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be forever loving y'all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be forever loving y'all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be forever loving y'all.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of the party?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a pretty killer vibe.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is one of Bob's favorite
spots to sit and have a joint in the
[SPEAKER_09]: morning, was right out on these steps and
under this tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why they made this little spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: These two lions, I believe, were a gift
for Ethiopia only a few decades ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna rock it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now, now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep on rocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep the world rocking now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now, now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep on rocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash now.
[SPEAKER_20]: You keep on rocking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_15]: it is so fast, so fast, so fast.
[SPEAKER_20]: That felt nice,
that felt nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you think he was pointing at you?
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I knew it was a camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wiped the lens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Life, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, this is friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I should respect the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bubble man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Life, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gideon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gideon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny be the soul is my brother from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm bubble man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I taught him how to make hats.

[SPEAKER_12]: You find me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I find Gideon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey.

[SPEAKER_12]: Johnny buy hook, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, tell Johnny you find me.

[SPEAKER_09]: I recognized you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for recognizing me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I seen him from the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's follow Kittis.
[SPEAKER_20]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a magnet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Tony.
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_20]: On the count of three.
[SPEAKER_20]: One.
[SPEAKER_20]: On the count of seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: One.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five.
Six.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm rolling with Kittis.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how we're coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're coming in hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a topsy turvy world.
[SPEAKER_14]: Topsy turvy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Aluta never stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Aluta continues.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fire ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, Kittis side.
Kittis side.
All right.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kittis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kittis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was kind of fun walking in with
Kittis.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just pretty much recognized every
single person here.
[SPEAKER_09]: He does.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's kind of the never-aging agent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, he's just looking for a friend
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to find some of the ganja on a
stick for them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, where have we got it?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to look for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got the Kitt cut in candy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Told you it looked like cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's that from?
[SPEAKER_15]: Farmer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Farmer?
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the farmers that I used to farm
with.
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is, oh, tonight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you're going to the airport?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know Bolbet?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: These guys used to live in Bolbet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You still in Bolbet?
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's asking me if I know Bolbet.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, your friend's living in Bolbet.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you should.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you should.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know a farm tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the things we're going to
change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrapping the bud in plastic just gives it
a chance to go moldy, which is not good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It smells strong.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's going to be an email in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have an email.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll text you how you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: You like it?
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't want to work?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give us two words on Bob's
birthday today, or three even.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it making you feel?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the vibe?
[SPEAKER_09]: As an ambassador.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the best thing we could do as a
journalist and musician.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a huge honor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say this much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's well-deserved.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some elders right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kittis and Bongo.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's rip a beat, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's rip a beat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here with Julian Marley,
and we're here on Bob's birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: His 70th Earth Strong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was saying it would have been his 70th
Earth Strong, but really, it is his 70th
[SPEAKER_21]: Earth Strong.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's spirituality because, as you say,
spirit goes on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how are you feeling about Jamaica
opening up with their ganja laws and
[SPEAKER_09]: finally seeming to see the light in the
sense that it seems as though we're moving
[SPEAKER_09]: forward to a point in time where Jamaicans
won't be beat for having ganja,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they won't beat Jamaicans.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be jailed for it, and potentially,
they'll actually be able to benefit from
[SPEAKER_21]: something that... Well, you know,
as you say, we're in some bugs.
[SPEAKER_21]: The rest of the world, the whole time that
we're living in, everyone's gravitating to
[SPEAKER_21]: his consciousness and more naturality,
more healthy living.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the right time for it, you know?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Rasta Man has probably been showing
the world from like 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting because you've had the
Rastas saying it for 40 plus years,
[SPEAKER_09]: and now you've got people in white lab
coats saying it, and people are hearing
[SPEAKER_09]: it, and they're like, oh, did you hear
about this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, I think they were singing
about that like 30 or 400 years ago.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you see, almost, it's a circle.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's great, it's great.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's from now on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's as high as Rasta.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the only thing that we are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't rob no one, you don't fight no
one.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a real Rasta.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one safe ground for you,
but wouldn't it be nice if you had many
[SPEAKER_09]: more and open that up for everyone in the
country?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us start with Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the cameraman right here
is from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't go out of bounds until they open
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what about you yourself?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your projects that you're working
on these days?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working on a new album.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, nice.
Summer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Summer?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Time's moving so fast.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're working so fast and harder.
[SPEAKER_21]: But time is still working.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's moving fast.
[SPEAKER_21]: So hopefully it's summer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you guys said it fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Forward ever, backwards never.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks for joining me, Julian.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, baby?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's the wrong beat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Until there is no longer first class nor
second class citizens of any nation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Until the color of a man's skin is of no
more significance than the color of his
[SPEAKER_10]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you love the fire, it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have some artists that try to mess up
the business of reggae music.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this rock is standard with the great
Bob Marley set.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dennis Brown and Peter Tosh.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we're going for them.
Accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: They believe in a God.
[SPEAKER_10]: They believe in a you.
[SPEAKER_10]: They mix up like the bees in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Step on them like the cheese on my shoe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got no time to waste.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna be a slave to them system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just take a look how the world is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a handful of men run the world
business.
[SPEAKER_10]: About 2000 years they've planned this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a deep, they don't care if this is
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're deep with science and they use it
against with the rules that we've made
[SPEAKER_10]: figure through this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold poverty is no accident.
[SPEAKER_10]: The machine of the world with the rules
and civics.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want no capitalists.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you love it, say, boy, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Say, boy, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me talk to the capitalists.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me talk to the politicians.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a different side.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was a test, they wouldn't get A
plus.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when they make the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: the exchange rate, but call the dollar,
get the rema, and the solar light bill,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's gonna be cheaper.
[SPEAKER_10]: But a JPS, they prefer keep your Ebenezer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you scrooge when they get the people.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you starve on every year,
you buy a better vehicle.
[SPEAKER_10]: The things they do are bad, but still you
manage to keep your jobs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a politician.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me sing something for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we carry on the tradition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just come closer to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got something I want to show you.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, boys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have a session.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can we come over?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing it over there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm back here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks like trouble right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's that?
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've got a, are you sure it's on
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we asked for a torch when we were down
here for the mothership, and somebody
[SPEAKER_19]: brought us this giant torch that we're
trying to hide.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at the Bob Marley thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounds like a whistle inside Bob Marley's
house.
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at his eye over here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if this is okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Seems pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are you at, Mark?
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are you at right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we found ourselves a little zone here,
and we are dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tony and I just found out that the bill
has been passed in Parliament from a
[SPEAKER_09]: friend, so this is apparently public
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if the observer writes about it
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we just had our first official dab
here in Jamaica, Kingston, in Bob Marley's
[SPEAKER_09]: old house, 56 Hope Road, the museum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you might be a kid.
I'm always on your side.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always on your side.
I'm always on your side.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh!
Uh!
Uh!
We're not ready, we're not ready for we
keep it steady
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't know it yet Don't worry about
it, every great revolutionary was
[SPEAKER_20]: controversial They say Bobbie is
controversial, they don't say it They say
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Tosh is controversial, they don't
say it They say Dennis Brown is
[SPEAKER_20]: controversial, they don't say it But what
a wonderful legacy, they don't say it And
[SPEAKER_20]: so we have to get uncomfortable to make
certain things work, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah man, shake up the system a little bit
and show them a better way of doing it
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_20]: Good And this artist is no doubt ranked
among the top 5 around the world in terms
[SPEAKER_20]: of reggae artists to continue the legacy
of every great reggae artist before him
[SPEAKER_20]: and indeed the Honourable Robert Nessa
Marley from Marley Museum Marley 70,
[SPEAKER_20]: make some noise right now for Grannis!
[SPEAKER_22]: Greetings in the name of His Imperial
Majesty, Emperor Aelius last year,

identify that even more Outside of music
