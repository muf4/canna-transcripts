[SPEAKER_04]: Just bumped into Merlin here at the DNA
booth at Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got DNA behind us having a party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably best not to bring the camera over
while they're having personal
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations and record what they're
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, what a trip bumping into you in
Spain, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny fucking B?
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B and saving the turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Saving the turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing the ICBC thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pumping the book?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pumping the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even got the box of stickers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: This place is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know you'd find me here?
[SPEAKER_04]: At the DNA booth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Don and Aaron are both right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavors from the homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, let's drop Stop Playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA genetics, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret society hash code.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's served.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn from bubble man himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my Puffco stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go over that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you fucking serious?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, just made it down by the water after
Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great event that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: W in the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stayed there a couple years ago and just
just down by the marina.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to get the vibes of the water and
the boats and it's gonna go eat some food
[SPEAKER_04]: with a couple of buddies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna start with Abba.
Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Persos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tristan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you go to Persos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brennan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Velissima.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I haven't stayed here for a few
years but this is a beautiful area of
[SPEAKER_04]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some good skateboard culture happens here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful pier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just over there, Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, got a little gift from some
homie working for DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is powered by secret society hash
code.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our turps don't lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not actually sure what the cultivar
was on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says it's two grams of cold cure
though, so that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably get a nice up close
there if you don't block out the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can go up there
without just holding the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can usually get a... Can you go
closer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoomed in on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's take a little dip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nice shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually excited for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's crazy is that it is Barcelona,
so you want to be safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't just want to kind of be puffing
anywhere in Barcelona, but this is a
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty kind of wealthy area where people
are doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of skateboard culture
hangs out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent some time here before myself,
so I'm pretty confident that I'll get away
[SPEAKER_04]: with a couple of Puffco or a couple of
Carta puffs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get a huge kick down today from
Puffco as well, so I'll have the Puffco
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Carta going toe to toe with one
another and seeing which ones I like and
[SPEAKER_04]: which times, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: With all these devices, I find the best
one is the one that you need at the time
[SPEAKER_04]: that you need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, here we go with a little puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, when you're in Spain,
be careful, be smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to puff too out in the
open.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a bit of a harsh belief
system when it comes to the police in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular, so just be low-key and enjoy
your vibes.
I'll see you next time.
