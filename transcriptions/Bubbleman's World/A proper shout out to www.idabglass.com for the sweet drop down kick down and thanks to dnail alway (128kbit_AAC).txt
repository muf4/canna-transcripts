[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and I wanted to give today a quick shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the good people at IDAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just received this in the mail and I
want to thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my drop-down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a couple of little opal marbles
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice little unit and I'm about to
throw it in the fab bag right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can check these guys out actually
at IDAB.com and at Instagram at IDAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can check those guys out and I'm
really stoked because I've been waiting,
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting to use my silicon carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flav told me it wasn't really a good idea
that I was going directly into it so I
[SPEAKER_01]: really needed to get on this drop-down
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first drop-down so I really
want to thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silicon carbide nail is going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the guys at D-Nail for
setting this up because I don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys at IDAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Brian and Stevie who sort of put
the word out for me and let them know that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking for a nice drop-down for my
fab bag and well that's just a real nice
[SPEAKER_01]: drop-down I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look pretty good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you guys feel a little bit better now
that the titanium is not directly in my
[SPEAKER_01]: joint of the fab bag so I've got it
turning on, heating up as we speak so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we'll go with the last of Johnny B's
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave him the lamb's bread, my seedling
from 19 and a half years ago, 1995 when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was married in Negril.
[SPEAKER_01]: I collected some seeds on Orange Hill past
the cliffs in Negril there and I brought
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept those seeds up until May of 2014 in
which I cracked eight of them but only one
[SPEAKER_01]: actually cracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: One became the female that I am now about
to smoke out of this lovely drop-down and
[SPEAKER_01]: the silicon carbide nail so just thanks
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's a big beautiful cycle of
friends helping friends to make all this
[SPEAKER_01]: work and when you see a 20-year cycle come
into effect I mean where do you think the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys IDAB guys were Stevie or Brian from
D-Nail were 20 years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they were probably playing around
in a playground somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even still in diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know those guys if they're in
their 30s or if they're just in their 20s
[SPEAKER_01]: still but awesome that you guys could come
this full circle around to this lamb's
[SPEAKER_01]: bread 20-year-old strain coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean mothership definitely didn't exist
back then so there's another thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright we're up to temperature here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a nice 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it set today to about 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me all the time why I have
different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hash I prefer to lower temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hash I prefer to higher temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the wax membrane is a little bit
thicker in which case we you know we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: mind a little bit of a warmer temperature
to get that that oil boiling out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the piece feels pretty good in my
hand I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking great out in the sunset there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys think fab in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fab tabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun's going down behind the trees here
real quick so I guess we're doing a sunset
[SPEAKER_01]: rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to wait till that temperature gets
perfect before I hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get my little dabber out that
they also sent me from D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the dabber the carb cap I'm sorry
that works with the carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the silicone carbide bowl is enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually they sent me a lovely dabber and
I'm gonna go get it real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright there we go look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The iDab carb cap and it actually is big
enough to work on the carbide nail and it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes with a dabber as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the dry sift sitting here on the
skillet tool so I'm gonna use that but
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll transfer over to the carb cap when
we're done the rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man does that taste incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man 710 degrees Fahrenheit on the silicone
carbide nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing a light smoke it's very very
turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a wonderful turp rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said with the silicone carbide
gotta crank that nail up a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to get that real smoky hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was just real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silicone carbide's cool too because
what little residual that it leaves it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a matter of giving it a light scrape
blowing it off the nail and the nail is
[SPEAKER_01]: clean again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gotta say once again thank you to the
good folks at iDab.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram they are at iDab.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much I'm gonna finish
this video off with one more rip and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think what we're gonna go for is a little
D420K OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a nice big fat rip of that
shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright here we go.

sunset.
