[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am just doing a little session out here
on the hood of my truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful morning here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to actually head over to the
Sunshine Coast to visit Cory and
[SPEAKER_04]: Stratosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a bunch of glass blowers over
there and they've been doing some
[SPEAKER_04]: wonderful things for the last couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, they ran out of oxygen the
other day so we won't be seeing them
[SPEAKER_04]: actually do their trade, but we will be
lucky enough to see the entire group of
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces that were made for the show down at
Mr. Ed's in LA, a gallery that I guess is
[SPEAKER_04]: organizing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's time for a little blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we got a little bit of
concentrated X for the morning blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely like dry sift butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the easiest thing to collect,
but patience is a virtue.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so pretty stoked on heading
over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to see Flav as well today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to go see Flav and check out some of
his collection that we haven't seen in a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time and just have an overall
wonderful session with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been months since I've seen him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a terpene delivery coming so he's
going to be quite excited about his
[SPEAKER_04]: flavors that are coming to him today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll do a little terpene daunt
but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not exactly sure how it's going to play
out, but looking forward to the day
[SPEAKER_04]: nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the drone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, I'm sure I'm not able to
drone on the ferry, but guaranteed we will
[SPEAKER_04]: be droning on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sunshine Coast today for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure out some nice footage for you
guys to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took a tiny little bit of water in the
mouth there, but it's always more
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoyable when it's the fresh,
fresh cold water that hasn't had a single
[SPEAKER_04]: hit thrown gone through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give thanks to the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little baby cakes there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little piece I picked up in Spain a couple
years ago and it's really served me well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dropped in numerous times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never broken and it's always gotten
the job done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to them for making a cool
little pipe like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess really all there's left to do
is drive to the ferry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course I'm going to bring you guys
along with me, show you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: the road on the way there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe once we get to the ferry,
we can chill out and have another session.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you there.
See you.
See you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as always, I've gotten here to the
ferry a little bit early, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely better than showing up early.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit late, I'm not going to
lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sitting here for a while now and
figured, why not have a little grasshopper
[SPEAKER_04]: session?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet little unit, easy to use,
and a lot less overpowering than the
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrates, obviously, which is
generally what I appreciate and am looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes it's just nice to have a
little hit of Jat Herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there's all of you out
there that have been telling me for years,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's just something different about the
herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's something different
about the herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the herbs, not the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm loading up some beautiful Astro Boy
here, super beautifully cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a nice pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about like beyond
dried out like that other herb that I had,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: This Astro Boy is cured really nice,
put in a nice enclosed space and just all
[SPEAKER_04]: around nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's hit that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go from red in under five seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go to blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the little blue guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, George, once again from Vape
Fiend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had my own mother call about this today
and ask about what kind of vaporizer is
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, looks like we're getting ready to go
on the ferry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grasshopper session will have to wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we just jumped in the
elevator here on the ferry and we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: going to kind of go for a little loop
around, find a little spot to hit this
[SPEAKER_04]: grasshopper because it didn't get to
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stick with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right to the sun deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Avoided the entire ferry completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are now just on the sun deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The front here and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still in the shade here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the captain up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye, Aye, Capitan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, we're having so much fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as we're pulling up to the ferry,
it looks like we have a little bit of time
[SPEAKER_04]: to just have one quick little rip on the
hit man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pull out a little rosin from the west
coast coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concentrate, boys, as I'm always happy to
be puffing on their rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, we got some pretty nice stuff here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make a little dabby doodle there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that away for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: These ferries don't mess around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got my hit man stacked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw a little water in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a little bit more enjoyable
with water, I would have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a little bit less than last time in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And heat bubble, or the nail, I guess you
could call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hit much titanium, but this one
little, I guess it's an eight mil,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe a 10, it's the one travel nail that
I've just never had a problem with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never broke it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if you can even break these
titanium nails.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done it myself, but who's to
say someone out there hasn't done it
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so put that away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice if I can find my carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot happens like that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: No carb cap for this rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was just about perfect,
aside from the fact that I dropped my
[SPEAKER_04]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a few carpet scourds on the dabber,
but that can always be cleaned off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the meantime, I'm going to wait
until the ferry gets to the end and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: continue our journey towards stratosphere
and quarry glass to see what those guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are up to.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, so I made it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm over at quarry's spot and Flav421
joined us as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for having me, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been such a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just kind of been chilling and
puffing a few bowls and relaxing in the
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful sunshine here, watching the dogs
have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we figured we'd film a little intro,
seeing as though I filmed so much just to
[SPEAKER_04]: get here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I should probably film a little
bit while I was here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we going to take a look at
today, Corey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we're going to have a look at some
of the glass that myself, Mish,
[SPEAKER_04]: Stratus, John K, JT Glass have been making
for a show coming up at Captain Ed's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Strange Brew on April 15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be here shortly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we'll give you a tour of upstairs
and everything we've made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to hump your buddy there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little dog humping going on in the
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: You showed me a few of those pieces
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the style, the square-esque.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is Bumbleman's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I guess the dogs are getting
kicked out now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gots to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gots to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were puffing on some Congolese,
was it rosin or bubble hash?
Bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congolese bubble hash pressed out to look
rosin-esque.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very bubbly and gooey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very bubbly and gooey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for bringing that treat,
Flav.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to smoke out a Pachamama,
the recycler piece that Corey and Pat did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we looked at it last time I was
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was completely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have like a spinning herb leaf?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's another rainbow spinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one down below.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congolese take care of that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long pendants, big hanging down pendants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, pendants away, everything away.
[SPEAKER_11]: What about my keys around my neck?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this safe?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, if you had it in your hand and
you were swinging it around like this as
[SPEAKER_11]: you're dabbing, that might be a little
sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that's still too
nerve-racking for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these, just catching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about just be like the most respectful
you can when you hit a piece like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of little hooks that you can
grab onto and send that thing flying for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Owe it to yourself to be wary and take
care and if you're not comfortable,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually say it's probably the
most breakable piece that I own.
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that has the most amount of fine
detailed fragility when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_11]: the butterflies and the flowers and this
is even compared to the hands and the
[SPEAKER_11]: hands and the fingers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every single aspect of the whole piece.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: It deserves the most care and respect in
that sense when handling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in good hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is in good hands at least.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I'm looking forward to checking out
some glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess these guys will be here in the
near future and we'll probably just have a
[SPEAKER_04]: little session and hit some turps and some
bong grips in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass, beautiful, Sunshine Coast,
multi acre property.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: All you cool people should fucking come
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's a great place to live up
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually don't, it'll spoil how beautiful
it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sea waves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea waves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just 2% of you can come.
[SPEAKER_11]: Only the ones with the full melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Owe, full melt snobbery in full effect
here on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or mothership glass, let's just take it to
the next level of snobbery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Owe, mothership glass too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there's the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can see the ocean through the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we'll have to get some drone footage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can fly around your yard real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well this is mossy and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this was out east, we'd already be
getting picked up by mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well when I was out east just last week it
was like 0 to negative 4 and fucking cold
[SPEAKER_11]: as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's all summer long and you get the
odd mosquito but it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a nice shot.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, hasn't been that long
since it really stopped raining.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like 2 weeks ago this thing was
pretty much full.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's how much is soaked in our rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the summer it's getting placed like
hardly even a pond here in the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_04]: The red?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Congo red.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about some treats as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to turn our backs to not be
in the camera.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we are good.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do we have right here?
[SPEAKER_12]: Some concentrated X.
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one of them down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, it floats.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know what's in there but it's
floating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, go first one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on Opal, go get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get it, not the stick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get that stick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on Opal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opal, go get this.
Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flav doesn't mess around when it comes to
drop tash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to bring it all the way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unicorn tears need to be saved here folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unicorn tears indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch, it'll be one of the empty vials.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha, it'll still be worth the effort
even if it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I know who gets the first dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't open it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to dry that off.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we'll open it in the sun and we'll see
how she looks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dry as dry can be.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Want to smell it?
Very nice.
Yeah dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is definitely a dab for Dave.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mission accomplished already.
[SPEAKER_11]: Saved the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now smoke the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we smoke the hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: What a perfect day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dabbing in beautiful sunshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just checking the temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Turb, who's next?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll heat you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that sun for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real nice rip of the concentrated extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's going to go down nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good puffing spot you got here
Cory.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the sound of the water hitting the
water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once upon a time the property next to this
property was for sale.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lord all mercy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Mark's turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a derb.
[SPEAKER_11]: A derb at the lake on the bridge.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Off the course.
[SPEAKER_11]: Off the course.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the mothership.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the drop down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the drop down.
[SPEAKER_12]: She looks nice in the sun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I never even thought about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could just time it off the camera
seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that concentrated X bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come check it out up close.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get real close to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real nice quality on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I've got a couple from West Coast
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: In here as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are just stellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sorry purple candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one, which is a 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost can't remember the actual name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember it was from 25 micron
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to be puffing some bowls of that too
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say ye gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good to me.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to torch the bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to gear up the dabar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready for a dab of this too there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright Flav.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to the West Coast concentrate crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitting dabs in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try to get that down in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a nice camera shot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sun dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Milk in long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright Flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get you one of those.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a pretty damn amazing bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bubble hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble that he squeezed.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 micron bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go Flav.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You almost like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting rosin under the Perugala
Bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the creek.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's just how beautiful life is
on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't even looked at much glass yet
and it's still been a pretty awesome trip
[SPEAKER_04]: so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always happy to come out to the Sunshine
Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: See familiars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puff nice bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy fat glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And enjoy the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always hard to work on days like
this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute you step outside it's quickly
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I think next up is pull that drone
out of the box and let's see what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I'm excited to see that thing in
action.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoom around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good even nail coverage there Flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow that might be ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not heat it up that much?
[SPEAKER_11]: No I heated it up a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't feel hot at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So JT Hippo and yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John K.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John K.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collab with Nish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful little bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the Hippo?
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's Hippo, myself and Nish.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two are Jared and Nish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next one it's Hippo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hippo and Nish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next one is John K.
[SPEAKER_04]: and Nish.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he even awake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awake?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah Jared.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's who you're talking about right?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to do the NASA.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got back into the corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got more fuel again?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pretend to be this tall too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's short.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I just stand back here we're the same
height.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so we are here with Nish Glass in
the house and I guess we're going to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: you a little bit about kind of your style
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are obviously collaborations that
you've done with other artists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is for the Captain Ed show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Captain Ed's gallery show in Reseda
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reseda California alright that sounds
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's happening this no next month
literally in a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: April 15 actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: April 15 so mark that down in your
calendar if you're over in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah I just kind of wanted to talk
about your style here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a pretty cool little vase
like style.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bubbler.
[SPEAKER_04]: They chug real nice and I can see that you
guys have done a variety of different
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe you want to start down at the end
with the purple one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this purple one was made with John K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can they find him on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can find John K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah these are really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a purple lollipop one with a
wisteria backed crop circle section which
[SPEAKER_01]: is John's forte.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is also cool that it's the matching
marble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's also in the millie as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah the style is kind of I guess
based off classical you know shapes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know for me the bottle just seems
correct for smoking out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely comfy in the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's meant to fit in your hand meant
to pick up the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah the style is something that I'm
kind of stoked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see these two here you've got actual
down stems fitted in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah these have removable diffies that are
14 to 10 millimeter transitions and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know done with beautiful linework.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Jared and mashed into a bottle with
the really nice 8 millimeter opal coins
[SPEAKER_01]: that really pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And JT's is at JT Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can check out all of his fun
linework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular one was made with Corey
Glass at Corey Glass on Instagram and with
[SPEAKER_01]: Hippo Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on Instagram and kind of a fusion of
Hippo's awesome fume work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Corey wrapped a really beautiful
reticello over top of it for the
[SPEAKER_01]: midsection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah just like use other fume sections
as the accents within it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again it's you know has a nice 8
millimeter opal coin on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah that's the jugger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one here is done with Hippo's
fume tech again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just yeah a really cool little chugger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comfortable in the hand for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those cutesy bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all going down to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: These will all be available at the Captain
Ed show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there actually will be some others as
well that will make their way there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should be a nice collection of
collaborative bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for people that won't be able to
make it down the show and grab a piece via
[SPEAKER_04]: you or via one of the shops you sell at,
where do you direct those people?
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally I mean I will take personal
orders but really and ideally it's I send
[SPEAKER_01]: people to the shops that buy the pieces.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which name of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the shops would be like THC in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez where else am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Crazy Bill's Hamilton.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Culture Rising in London,
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's three options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah there's three solid options there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did a show with Jared in JT Glass
in Calgary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we at the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may still have some of the pieces
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah so it's kind of spreading out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully soon to be a little more
available in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah well it's definitely a unique style.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see a ton of blowers doing this
particular style.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah thank you very much Mark.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so we are back with Corey
Cottenham.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you guys have known before we've been
over here before and walked through his
[SPEAKER_04]: shop with Stratosphere and they showed us
a bunch of beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess now we're gonna do it all over
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude you got some beautiful pieces here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are also for the Captain Ed's show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah we've been busy getting busy so
there's a bunch of collabs here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some stuff from Hippo,
John K, Nick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nish was in the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: JT I still don't have anything with
Stratus here but we've got a couple of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger pieces that we've made that we're
bringing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go through them one by one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so this first one here this is a
collab with Jared Toner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nish already gave the IGs but JT Glass you
can find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the new Lucy color from North
Star layered over top of Wisteria and Jet
[SPEAKER_04]: Black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice color.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some of JT's pinwheel line work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah one of JT's Ratticello's and then I
took it to the fastening machine and did
[SPEAKER_08]: some fastening on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to take a picture of this and
make sure you guys see the fastening work
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff because we are a little bit away
from the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next up here we've got a piece
with John K so we've got his crop circles
[SPEAKER_04]: with some of my readies layered over top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Illuminati always a winner and then it's
got the same thing with a lot of Nish's
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces had the opal coin so it's got the
opal coin in the back same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice the way he's opened the down stem of
the bone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the crazy Ratticello over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the blacklight work as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been loving working with these
colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up we have another one with John K.
[SPEAKER_04]: And same with this one it's got a lot of
the Lucy on the top of Jet Black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight Lucy and then it's got Luke it's
kind of hard to tell with the lights on
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's got Lucy as the crop circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try and get some photos of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah even with the get some photos with
the lights turned around and you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: some really good shots with the UV
popping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got some timers sand
timers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember this one's either 30
seconds or 45 somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy enough to find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy enough to find out yeah and they're
set so yeah those look great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah a couple faceted ones over here also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this next one here is a cubic cycler
that I made with hippo glass so all hippo
[SPEAKER_04]: glass is fumed sections with a bunch of
hippo's marbles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really stoked on this piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love like this one out in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah that is a nice piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks straight up like plumbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: She pulls back that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice pull on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one we have is a similar design.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one's with John Caustic and this
one's got the Lucy over lemon drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even notice the Lucy it looks
like straight lemon drop and with the UV
[SPEAKER_04]: it just pops right out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah same thing it's got it as the crop
circles so when it's a little darker it
[SPEAKER_04]: really pops out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's harder to see with the bright lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll definitely make sure we get some
photos on all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next one's just myself so
slightly different take on that design.
[SPEAKER_04]: I switched around the triangle and piping
goes a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few more horns on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely got that personal touch to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that I've made in the past are a
lot bigger than these ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're three and a half inch squares.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knocked these ones down to two inch
squares so they're compact.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little more comfy in the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to make your own bangers for
this though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah those will be kind of insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just like the trough but something
square and it really goes so nice with
[SPEAKER_04]: this whole concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're sitting there's something
comforting about just seeing glass in
[SPEAKER_04]: shapes that aren't the standard vessels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love standard vessels I love all the
different jars and all the different sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of vase type things that you can do but
this is just kind of really a cool concept
[SPEAKER_04]: where you've got like a little cube of
glass in your hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then trying to step out of doing the
norm and doing what everybody else is
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to step out and do something a
little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice marble placement I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one here is another one with hippo
glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these fume sections and marbles.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one has Illuminati with the Lucy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the black is Lucy coated so it glows
purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Illuminati that bright green with my ready
sections over his fumed work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this last guy here is just
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has some ready sections over
straight lines and capped in between with
[SPEAKER_04]: just straight white readies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a bunch of faceted opals
just rough opals or tumbled opals on the
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah some little circular ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah some little circular ones and the
base on that one also has a pretty nice
[SPEAKER_04]: image with the off-axis ready with the
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real nice mouthpiece on it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hand ground so it's been lapped
so it's got that nice fine finish to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two machined to be a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the flare opening that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love pipes in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel always so blessed to be able to
hang out with these guys who do this
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing artwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course focus on the plant that we
love by creating pipes to you know use for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a wonderful thing that we've
come such a long way that it's not so much
[SPEAKER_04]: fighting the law anymore and the worry of
having your pipe shop busted and having
[SPEAKER_04]: your pipes taken away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a shrinking work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Times are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Times are changing for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well thanks for having me man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey so what's up guys I'm back with John
K.
[SPEAKER_04]: You heard that name a few times and most
of his glass actually got packed up but
[SPEAKER_04]: he's got a couple of nice pieces out here
that he's gonna tell us about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pick one and start telling us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright well this is what I call a drop
drain recycler.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's got the perk with the drain built
inside of it which is a little different
[SPEAKER_10]: than most recyclers you see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I noticed that right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: At first I thought oh it's short.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't quite go about halfway down but
then I realized you were filling the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire chamber with water and it really
chugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a collaboration with JT Glass
or Jared Toner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it spins real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty beefcake-y too.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times these recyclers feel really
dainty to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They feel almost like they're just gonna
break and this thing feels like it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: been super sized or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah these are designed essentially for
e-nails or you know more heavy setup.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a travel piece that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I travel in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it's a beautiful piece so this is
gonna be down at Captain Ed's gallery
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep on the 15th of April.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah you got these lines up here again
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah it has my signature crop circle
sections in it and then Jared's tight line
[SPEAKER_10]: work here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah on the inside of the perk there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't notice that the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice piece dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that one's gonna be getting
snapped up in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of marble you got there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a double fumicello that Jared made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job Jared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright you guys did a killer on that and
this is a pretty cool little sweet kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: beefcake-y little piece too.
[SPEAKER_10]: My cool mini jammer with Hippo glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah you and Hippo did that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah for sure so Hippo did all the fume
sections and the fume marble and then it's
[SPEAKER_10]: got my crop circle sections in it as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as some UV reactive glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take some pictures of those for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well awesome I look forward to seeing the
rest of the work there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I'll see photos of it head up on
Instagram.
