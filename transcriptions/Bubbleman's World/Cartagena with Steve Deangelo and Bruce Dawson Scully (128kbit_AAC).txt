[SPEAKER_05]: For 99% of everybody else, people who have
Alzheimer's, people who have cancer,
[SPEAKER_05]: people who have epilepsy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole plant extract is going to be a
superior cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should people have the right to get
isolates?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: People should have the right to choose
whatever cannabinoid formed they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all given endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can figure that one out on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are
endocannabinoid deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea of cannabinoids being
fortified into foods and put into drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people to have more access to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of people are
endocannabinoid deficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the largest neurotransmitter system
in the human body.
[SPEAKER_05]: In most of the world, for most of at least
the last 50 years, people have been
[SPEAKER_05]: deprived of the nutrient that engages with
that neurotransmitter system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: When this period is looked back upon,
it might be 100 years before it's looked
[SPEAKER_05]: on from this perspective, prohibition of
cannabis will be recognized as this
[SPEAKER_05]: bizarre thing where human beings willingly
divorce themselves from the most valuable
[SPEAKER_05]: plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: People will look at it incredulously.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is the human race learning a
valuable lesson like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find very valuable the regulation and
the changes that are happening today are
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're actually making you test
dose, exhibit, show strain, value,
[SPEAKER_03]: like whether it tastes here CBD,
so you can make educated decisions on what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're consuming because previously it was
just a bag of green or you eat a gummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what else is going to happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumer protection is the best part of
the new regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of really, really,
really bad parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me personally, who's eaten a really
hardcore edible and was not prepared for
[SPEAKER_03]: it, scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I can sit there and say, I just want a
little- 10 milligrams for you,
man.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely none of Skunk Man Sam's
thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever have one of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand milligrams?
[SPEAKER_03]: A thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a thousand milligrams that are
sitting is probably historic for most
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Rob Walsh taking two and
walking out on Queens Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, you're a machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, everybody's system is
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's needs are different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your buddy Bruce over here on the other
hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think CBD is going to be a bubble
and that bubble is going to break.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we know from a fully legal mature
cannabis market where people have access
[SPEAKER_05]: to the full spectrum of cannabinoids,
very few people choose a CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people prefer, I'd say,
of all of our CBD rich formulations,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's a flower or a tincture or a
capsule, one-to-one is really the most
[SPEAKER_05]: preferred combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce founded Weed MD in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, he worked in like old folks
homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came from a highly regulated
business already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone was like, the cannabis
industry is so regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce was just like- Well, it wasn't just
that, the regulation knowledge and
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more around the polypharmacy issues
with seniors and looking at seniors
[SPEAKER_03]: suffering with over prescribing of opioids
and anti-psychotropic drugs and looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: the value of cannabis that could actually
treat some of these indications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really what made it for me
valuable to get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2012 in Canada, I'm going to speak
to the beginning of time of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always jokes about that because people
say that to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, since 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this could be a really
interesting segue of my career path and
[SPEAKER_03]: what I've been involved with my whole life
and still teach and provide value for
[SPEAKER_03]: seniors and do it differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I made my first business card and
it had a cannabis leaf on the back,
[SPEAKER_03]: people looked at me like I was an alien,
like the pharmacies and the corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, are you insane?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, maybe I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I am a little insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's evolving and it's developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm super glad that I chose this path
to go on with you guys on this adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the pioneers and really have blazed
the trails and really unloaded and figured
[SPEAKER_03]: out the science for what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm learning every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what's going on from 2012
to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like six or seven years of
hardcore, intensive sort of training.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every day is a new day and every day
you learn something totally new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very complex world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like, you know, novel
cannabinoids and everything that's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening and THCA and this and that and
terpene values and what effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it started with sativa that makes you
feel awake and, you know, it's like all
[SPEAKER_03]: these things that we're learning about
this industry that's so, and this medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: and this herb and this incredible plan
that makes us so unique and valuable and
[SPEAKER_03]: just loving the journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why you caught that insanity,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why I caught that insanity,
which I call divine madness.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have all been called by
something, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is, I don't think we've fully
wrapped our minds around or our hearts
[SPEAKER_05]: around or certainly our brains around what
this thing is, but we're all being called
[SPEAKER_05]: by the same forces.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it leaves you with like a really great
feeling at the end of it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, at the end of every day,
when I was in the long-term care world,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd come home and I'd actually have this
feeling of like, I actually just actually
[SPEAKER_03]: provided for the world today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people died and we took care of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We let them live their lives with
integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We celebrated their life for as long as
they lived in these homes and like all
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I transitioned out of this career
and I was thinking, how am I going to ever
[SPEAKER_03]: compare to this value of my life?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel the same way about and
interested in something, but this has
[SPEAKER_03]: actually done that for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm, you know, this experience has
actually provided that value for me with
[SPEAKER_03]: all the patients and all the lives that
are changed and all the incredible stories
[SPEAKER_03]: that are shared with me over the last
seven years that I've been involved in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very fortunate to be included in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is cannabis in any senior facilities in
Canada now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had actually like corporate contracts
and senior facilities to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: prescriptions with the doctors to treat
medical indications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for real with cannabis, like that's
what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are interested and they're,
you know, it's not the 90 year olds that
[SPEAKER_03]: are checking out like looking at this so
intensely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the children of the seniors that are
looking at their poor parents,
[SPEAKER_03]: like being all doped up on opioids and
drooling on themselves and are
[SPEAKER_03]: non-functioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's just try this for a minute and
see if they respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden they're walking around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandma hasn't walked in two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been sitting there drooling on
herself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought she was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's dancing, having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's freaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to feel bad when you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth though that this happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I'm going to do on this
trip is visit an elder community down in
[SPEAKER_05]: Nacocca.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 14 hours in Nacocca.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you go to this community?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that you went to?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm getting ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an elder community that features a
vegetarian diet that incorporates
[SPEAKER_05]: nutritional cannabis into that diet,
cannabis medicines,
[SPEAKER_05]: and topical treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting ready to go down there and see
it, but the organizers are just reporting
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing, amazing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, try to leave at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see all the lights on the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was hanging out with Elgato.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like stars in the hills.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certain points you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know these little family communities
in these mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure wouldn't be hard to find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we should go see it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hundred of them right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember though, all of those farms are
growing hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing, but try this actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be insulting,
but I'm telling you, I did not see a leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty shocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a work to be done in the hills for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cool thing is, it wasn't too long ago
that they discovered that you could change
[SPEAKER_03]: the photo period of the plant to make it
bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: These lights all of a sudden emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these key figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elgato was one of the guys that went up
into the hills, the Marimberos,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he showed them how to extend their
light cycles, all those lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are there because of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him, I'm like, dude, that's epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like Mustafa, the Nigerian that
brought Lebanese screening techniques to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Morocco in 1965 and started this
huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine being the one dude that went to
Morocco and was just like, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you guys know about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen this before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 150 miles of cannabis just kept
planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that says one person can't make a
difference, I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes all of us, but there are certain
key people at certain times that just
[SPEAKER_01]: crack it out of the park without even
trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always wonder, was it the time or was
it the person?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it's taken an army of thousands
of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tens of thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't go back to the 20s and the
30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of years, maybe thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the European tradition, I would put the
date at around 300, which is when the
[SPEAKER_05]: Roman Empire adopted Christianity as its
official religion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then bishops were sent out all across
Europe to cut down the sacred groves of
[SPEAKER_05]: trees, to poison the sacred springs,
to burn the sacred books and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Muslims were doing it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the Christians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was 14th or 16th
century in Cairo, but the Sufis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Muslim Sufis who were hash eaters,
they were having their teeth wrenched out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would put their fingers down their
throats.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they threw up green and it was
cannabis, they would pull their teeth out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't stop eating hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the stories that I tell
about this too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, if you go back in the history,
what you find is that cannabis has always
[SPEAKER_05]: been an object of suspicion by elites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Financial elites, racial elites,
religious elites, any kind of elite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason for that is that the
authority of the direct spiritual
[SPEAKER_05]: experience that we have with cannabis is
stronger than any other intervening,
[SPEAKER_05]: mediating authority.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seemingly forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people who don't use it that have
this massive problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Dr. David Allen that talks
about the amygdala hijacking of the little
[SPEAKER_01]: switch that's fight or flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about the endocannabinoid system
and how this little switch gets rusted in
[SPEAKER_01]: to flight mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that are really severely
endocannabinoid deficient are like they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be prison guards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be in the army.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to work for the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to have control and rule over
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people that have the most
problem with people using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, just don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just habitual florists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Steve said, in 100 years from now
we're going to be looking back and say how
[SPEAKER_03]: silly this discussion is.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have now, we never had before,
is with the reforms that have happened and
[SPEAKER_05]: the science that's happened, we now have
an ability to absolutely document
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that we've been saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now modern science is coming along.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for years they would be like,
oh yeah, you can go look at the old
[SPEAKER_05]: medical check-ups.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, oh yeah, that's fucking
Hitler's, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh now, take a look.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the human clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Data library, analysis, computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: With people holding everything in the palm
of their hand, like access to all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, oh I want you to check that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, say what you want about those
things, but they're definitely like a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like people revolting because of
what they learn on these phones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The difference between before internet and
after internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first started doing activist work,
if I wanted to catch the government in a
[SPEAKER_05]: lie, I had to sneak into the university
library, which was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: at the two hour bus ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was too young to go into the university,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to go through these card
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd have to find these old dusty
volumes of like original material.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd have to copy them, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'd have to like get this stuff,
if I wanted to share it with anybody,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to like run it off on this old
technology called a mimeograph machine and
[SPEAKER_05]: fold it up and put it in envelopes and put
stamps on it and take it to the post
[SPEAKER_05]: office, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It took forever to find out a government
lie and debunk it now, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I see some piece of bullshit
that comes along and go debunk and I put
[SPEAKER_05]: in the name of the study and usually like
I've got six or eight people around the
[SPEAKER_05]: world who've already analyzed the thing,
proven it to be false, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: My 40,000 followers know about it and
they're spreading it all around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the internet, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the RCMP, what they announced
in Canada recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They said this Lego gummy was such a high
milligram dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was enough to kill a toddler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have since retracted their statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you read their retractments,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, we took a 25 pound dog and
injected it with three ounces of extract
[SPEAKER_01]: intravenously and we surely thought it
would die and a day and a half later to
[SPEAKER_01]: our surprise, it was fully recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we took another dog and injected
seven grams of pure extract into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and they're just like,
to our surprise, once again, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: dose we can give these dogs to induce
death.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have just like gone back to the
East India report, which the English
[SPEAKER_05]: parliament commissioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was published in 1894 and they already
tortured dozens of dogs to prove this way
[SPEAKER_05]: back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not need to do any more dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever been to the
ICRS, but the International Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: Research Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was there in Leiden in March and the
first day was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with Dave Watson and some other
friend from SEGRA, a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the first day was all John
McPartland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ian, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: John McPartland spoke and he was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing the pollen study where the
pollen was found and tracing the history
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis through these pollen tests
that they've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plant-based, but the next day it
turned into like, we tortured these mice
[SPEAKER_01]: for 14 hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, they have to give them
so much smoke because, and I asked the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy, I said, why do you have to give them
like that much smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the equivalent of like a person
smoking 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, when we give them a
small amount, we can't tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, that's how it fucking
works, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to destroy them with
10 pounds worth of weed and then walk them
[SPEAKER_01]: across a board of nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see how fast they react.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, listen, there's gotta be
better ways for us to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe, maybe we could take
psychedelics and learn about some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why do we need to torture animals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't sit through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Torturing monkeys and dogs and rats and
mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, man, this is like
part of the science that I'm not a big fan
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gotta be another way we can create
a system that can still produce results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can learn these mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can learn how they work without,
without creating that karmic debt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In all of recorded human history,
there is not one death that's been
[SPEAKER_05]: produced by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't have human trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: We instead need to torture animals who
don't have the ability to give informed
[SPEAKER_05]: consent.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of human beings happy to
give their informed consent to participate
[SPEAKER_05]: in cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Willie Nelson, research that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been smoking pop for 50 or 60 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's unbelievable how they just look
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like still to this day, I think that until
they acknowledge that it's not dangerous,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't need to protect children
from it, that maybe we should protect
[SPEAKER_01]: children from pharmaceutical drugs like
fentanyl and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things have very low LD50 numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the amount, which is also a
sick, if you know what LD50 means,
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes right back to testing in
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the amount of the dose that they
give the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: When 50% of the subjects die and that's,
that's at the end of the day, you protect
[SPEAKER_01]: children from everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course they're developing in
this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but it's not such a worry the way
they treat cannabis, like plutonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a biometric three foot
thick safe with rebar enforced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like treating it like it's
plutonium is part of, to me, it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: part of why it's not going the way family
homes and their bars are sitting out on
[SPEAKER_03]: the counters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that they, they, they still
regard cannabis as a bad plant and as a
[SPEAKER_05]: dangerous plant and that informs
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in California right now, we have
basically a California right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: the since legalization for adult use on
1118, we lost about 50% of the previous
[SPEAKER_05]: legal consumer base.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the tax rate went from around 10%
to in some cases above 40%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody who was in the market before
January 1st, 2018 was somebody who had a
[SPEAKER_05]: recommendation from their doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them were veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them were seniors.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them were families with children
and they were the parents consideration
[SPEAKER_03]: for the, for the medicine, for the
medicinal part.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't get consideration in the tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is, there was a split, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a very small discount,
which can be given.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to receive that discount,
you have to have a doctor's recommendation
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have to have a state issued
cannabis card.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you start adding up the costs of the
doctor's visit, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The time that you take off of work,
going down to fill out the application,
[SPEAKER_05]: picking your card, back up again,
you have to be quite a heavy consumer to
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to justify spending.
[SPEAKER_05]: What amounts for most people to four or
500 bucks to get a discount.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about seven and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it, it, it, the, the, the treatment of
cannabis as a sin product instead of a
[SPEAKER_05]: wellness product has, has sent,
you know, people who need a legal
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated market the most people who are
vulnerable, who have compromised immune
[SPEAKER_05]: systems, uh, back into the illicit market
where the cannabis is, is untested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you, you see it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we, um, I mean, the tax rate,
the tax rate of cannabis in California is
[SPEAKER_05]: magnitudes higher than the tax rate for
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the state is incentivizing people to
consume a substance, which we know makes
[SPEAKER_05]: them reckless and violent, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And disincentivize people from consuming a
product that makes them gentle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're raising a good point
because like, I still talk to people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in Canada and where we're like,
you know, there's heavy taxes on this
[SPEAKER_03]: product and they can go still visit their
buddy bill and grab their bag and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no pay taxes on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, how crazy is it that we've
evolved to the point where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually go in and have an edgy,
make an educated decision about the
[SPEAKER_03]: product that you're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to get to that point with the
testing and all, everything that's
[SPEAKER_03]: required to ensure that the grow and
everything is clean and tested and
[SPEAKER_03]: profiled.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, there's a, there's a serious
cost of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's value to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I'm like, and I'm talking,
I'm talking to guys that are like well off
[SPEAKER_03]: and like can actually afford this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like saying, Oh, I just still
bite off Bob because I get it for 40 bucks
[SPEAKER_03]: for a half an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dude, what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I wouldn't like we've evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this is something that, you know,
to the dispenser, you know, this is this,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is that you can see the profiles,
like get involved and see and learn about
[SPEAKER_03]: what works for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that cannabis consumers
have a right to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every other product for human consumption
is tested to make sure it's safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea that, that, that the only way
that you can get a cannabis product that
[SPEAKER_05]: has been tested and is safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is to pay 50% or 75% more than you would
need to on the unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another one of these examples of
where the stigma that attaches to cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: just continues to create all kinds of
social harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, these things are expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to get to that point of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not the cost of the testing
that's raising the price of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: at least in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot, there's some cost of
testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's really driven the price high is
the fact that the taxes are so high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason the taxes are so high is
because there's a whole constituency in
[SPEAKER_05]: the state of California that would prefer
to keep cannabis as inaccessible as they
[SPEAKER_05]: can for as long as they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the misguided belief that they are
protecting society by doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of them actually think that
they're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're a hundred percent right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I agree with you wholly that the cost
of the testing isn't raising those prices,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a cost of the production to meet
the criteria for the testing for release
[SPEAKER_03]: for distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the money is invested.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we get in return for having to
bear those costs is the ability to scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can scale efficiently,
then you can cover those costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm, you know, as much as I
love small... No man, I mean, I,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's again, this is a place where cannabis
consumers deserve what every other
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer has.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, we should always be able to get
good craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should also be able to get cannabis
that's grown at an efficient scale that
[SPEAKER_05]: may be a lower price.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should always be able to grow
cannabis in our own homes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be a multitude of ways for us
to get cannabis because there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: multitude of cannabis consumers with
different kinds of needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a, there's a huge new infusion
of, into the cannabis culture of all these
[SPEAKER_01]: young people that were never a part of it
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be open with our arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were, we were at a meeting one time and
the guy was like, yeah, I've been involved
[SPEAKER_00]: since, since the beginning, you know,
around 2012, 2013.
Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my 25 years in, you know,
for us, we started very young Jack's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in our teens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Jack's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, are you fucking kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were living in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were like, how are we going to
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad pulled me aside and said,
look, they're going to do this marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't want to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me and my friends were like,
let's become hemp activists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned all this shit from Jack's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in the prairies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's create a document, get some meetings
with our minister of finance and our
[SPEAKER_01]: minister of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's propose that we grow hemp in the
prairies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our, our deck said on the front page,
it said the trillion dollar crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy's just like, what,
you know, we're all dreaded out Greek like
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off mushrooms from the night
before, you know, students of Terrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just, he's just like,
you know, what is this guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, turn the page,
turn the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the billion dollar crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, that's a magazine cover
from popular mechanics in 1932.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure it was the first time
billion a dollar had ever been used in an
[SPEAKER_01]: economic statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all his ears perked up because he saw
what it was a real, you know, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: page out of Jack's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of pages out of Jack's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to believe an 80 year old
magazine before he's going to believe a
[SPEAKER_05]: handful of dreaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it took nine months and we got
a license to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted our first five acre
experimental field in Manitoba in 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 1998, all the groups across Canada had
organized and changed the law from
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental to commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when the hemp seed company
started being coming into play that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started a fighter remediation program
in the Ukraine to remove radioactive
[SPEAKER_01]: nucleotides out of the soil using hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know that that could happen,
but the people who grew in Ontario were
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco farmers, Joe Strobel and Jeff Kime
in 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the first license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they spray radium two 26 on their
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a radioactive nucleotide that raises
the levels of nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not allowed to do it in a lab,
but you can do it under the guise of an
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicide and a pesticide that they have
to wear like hazmat level seven suits or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, super poisonous shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to test their field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after the hemp crop, they tested it
and they were like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where did it all go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're looking at the hemp and then
they tested the hemp and they realized,
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, hemp is pulling out radioactive
nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that turned into a Chernobyl project
and it turned into this pretty cool thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of all, it was this,
it was a, the company was called
[SPEAKER_01]: Consolidated Growers and Processors and it
didn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the woman that was in charge of it
maybe was a con woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: She ended up in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company kind of folded, but my
partners started Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that company recently sold,
well about three years ago, it sold to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Compass Group for 133 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Compass Group just sold it to
Tilray for 419 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a hemp seed company, you know,
like that was just kind of, started by a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of dreadies that were like,
Hey, we should, you know, we should.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was in the hemp industry when that,
when all that happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I started my company Ecolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Ecolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were supporters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold it at our hemp store, the Hemp
Exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to buy Ecolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of very few, I mean,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two Star Dog came down later down,
down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two Star Dog came a little after us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a couple other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Danny always had access to good
stuff and Rob was, you know, another good
[SPEAKER_01]: source, but Rob's doing hemp again now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know about Rob Clark's
project in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this beautiful, he's doing
beautiful rugs and like all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Hemp Boutique, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he's working with a good friend
of mine from Turkey, Amir, and they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got like drumsticks that are stocks
with like fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to remember to talk to Rob about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, give Rob a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[SPEAKER_05]: do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do, do,
[SPEAKER_05]: do, do, do, do,
[SPEAKER_05]: do, do,
[SPEAKER_05]: do, do, do, do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're rich, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the time has come now for us to
embrace that vision for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for a long, long time, it was
difficult to find hemp products that were
[SPEAKER_05]: reasonably stylish enough that they could
catch traction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's changed now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, as soon as, as soon as I start
finding some more really great hemp stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, I'm going to start wearing it
all the time and we'll start talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that is another thing that we can
do to, to break down stigma and educate
[SPEAKER_05]: people about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, take a look at my jacket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show you something that you'll
probably find interesting and appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, uh, I mean, I, I was so involved
in the hemp projects from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved out to BC very early on 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got hemp going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, my partner's like,
go out to BC, be our pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they just stayed in Manitoba and did
this hemp thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up hooking up with Hillary black
becoming the first grower for the BC
[SPEAKER_01]: compassion club.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like kind of in love with Todd
McCormack.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like, should I go back down to
California and live in a mansion next to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Reagan's and grow weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, or should I stay in Canada
and start a compassionate club that's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, she became a servant to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This girl who grew up like fairly like,
you know, in West Vancouver with a well
[SPEAKER_01]: off family, gave up everything and just
went and her integrity was so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just like, didn't make any profit for
like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I felt, you know, that experience
of getting to grow for those people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were all terminally ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 97, 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot of AIDS patients suffering
from wasting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of junkies out on the street
that had acquired all sorts of heinous
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of them were stacked like five
or six, and then they had mental health
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was the beginning of civil
disobedience where we were kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we can't do this for headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be some serious, you know,
where it got, you know, California,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden some years later,
it's like, well, they're just going for
[SPEAKER_01]: headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as if it works for headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little did they know how deep the rabbit
hole went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where people are just always trying to,
you know, downplay the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just moving out to BC was an
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, meeting Hillary, doing that for
the club, getting busted at a roadblock
[SPEAKER_01]: with 16 pounds and a bunch of cash because
people were breaking into her club.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were driving cars right through the
front windows and then trying to steal the
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took home some herb one day and got
popped at a roadblock with it and became
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the first Compassion Club cases in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Richardson versus Regina was my case.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Conroy was my lawyer and it was,
I had no idea, but anything over three
[SPEAKER_01]: kilos in Canada at the time was a maximum
fine of, can anyone guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: 25?
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 years for just over, and I'm like,
wow, like just a second, like this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone's ever been given it
unless, you know, there was other
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances going on, but it still
freaked me out to face that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that moment I was, it was a cop who
busted me at a roadblock and I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking like, is this a, is this a costly
mistake or a valuable lesson?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I lost all this stuff for the club and
I felt like I had to pay it back and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pay a lawyer and I had to do all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know what to do and I started
the bubble bank company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, and I thanked that cop years
later at a roadblock keeping Constable
[SPEAKER_01]: John Lowe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled up to a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, John, he's like, he's like,
who's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Mark Richardson, you don't
remember you busted me at the roadblock
[SPEAKER_01]: under the bridge in West Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, oh, hello, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, listen, I said, listen,
I want to thank you because I'm not being
[SPEAKER_01]: sarcastic and I'm not like, I really want
to thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you helped me in a way that I can't
even begin to thank how much like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, because of you, like thousands of
people around the world are making their
[SPEAKER_01]: own clean hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would have never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was kind of like, what are you fucking
talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, I'm like,
I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not being negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to be like, give you a fuck
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm serious, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you are, you're a big part of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a big part of my history,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to mention you every chance
that I get because you're a part of my
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I said earlier, I think we're
all being called by a force that's too big
[SPEAKER_05]: for us to comprehend.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that force works in some really
mysterious ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it brings us pain so that we
can be motivated to make changes to this
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a front place on that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, man, it's what a pleasure sitting
and hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you're definitely a, a person I've
wanted to meet for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: being in the industry for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've admired the things that you've done,
the moves that you've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I've watched, I paid attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today when I, when I, I was just like,
I got to text them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to be like, I know he loves
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's link up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured you'd be super busy,
but not too busy for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, when I first, I got, I got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smiling on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got busted in 1999 with exactly 190.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even forgot.
[SPEAKER_05]: In any case, the important part of the
story is that I got busted in 1999,
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple hundred pounds of weed,
fairly serious charge in the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, well, so I get busted,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking lose everything that I've worked
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the cash, the house, everything,
everything's gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 45 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I'd already been in the process
of moving to California, but I got out to
[SPEAKER_05]: California and I've got like nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go into the dispensaries and I see
these ugly little balls of black view that
[SPEAKER_05]: are supposed to be water hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and I was like, I tried it,
you know, it was just, it didn't work for
[SPEAKER_05]: me, but I had read Rob Clark's book,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understood the process, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, where, where he had instructions
for making water hash, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: At first I started out with the coffee
cone, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I started out with the coffee cone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like familiar with the
technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in fact, when I used to go down to
Mexico, I would bring coffee cones with
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that I'd be able to have some good hash
to smoke while, while I was, while I was
[SPEAKER_05]: down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but I took a look at the situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, all right, there's an
opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got your bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took those bubble bags up to Mendocino
County and I started collecting
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's trim, which at that point they
were like, Oh, you want to take it away
[SPEAKER_05]: from here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting ready to compost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You change it away, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and so what I did differently was
drying and sieving the product and,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, and then branded it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiva crystals was the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and we hit the market probably
like 2003 is my, is my guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, man, you, you know, your bags
helped me build some business that allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: me to get back on my feet and start
Harborside, which allowed me to do this
[SPEAKER_05]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you, it wasn't too, like 2003,
2004, I'd get calls from guys from Eureka,
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity County, all in that, that area,
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be like, they'd be like,
look, dude, I don't know if you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: much you change shit over here,
but like, no, listen, this is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fucking erecting a statue of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a joke, but it was still like,
when that guy said that to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, girl, like that fucking
touches my heart, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I'm just selling bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the ones putting them to use,
you know, I'm just putting the information
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and teaching people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been, it's been one of the
biggest blessings of my life being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, going to Jamaica in 2000,
bringing bubble bags, turning all the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers in Orange Hill onto it,
giving bubble bags away, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the tune of a couple grand each trip
that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I knew no one's going to be able to
buy $250, you know, bags, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching people that was so rewarding and
being in the grill when they had the one
[SPEAKER_01]: high times cannabis cup, I can't remember
2014 maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, they're announcing the winners for
the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, third place is
this guy Winfred.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's, he's one of the guys I gave
bags to second place is junior.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like one of my bros that I taught
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place is Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy that I gave the first banks
to in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, this makes me feel so
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see the pride in their face,
you know, like I took this guilt,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept it over the course of 19 or 15
years and I, I worked it and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: if, if you listen to the bags,
they can direct you to finding the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that you're looking for,
you know, or growing better cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out how to get a plant to express
those profiles to the maximum,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, effectiveness of its abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people, a lot of people didn't get
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who had great weed,
they made bubble hash and were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 80% of everyone else was like,
they made that black balls and we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, no, this is what, let's just make
butane because no matter how shitty your
[SPEAKER_01]: weed was, butane always kind of came out
as a gold oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to a, to a lower level kind of
connoisseur or someone that's just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into it, that's good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, look at the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that same resin would be like sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't press together if we made
bubble out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number one question from bubble
hash makers is, well, how do I get my hash
[SPEAKER_01]: to melt like yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always have to say, well,
I don't want to be a Dick, but you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow better herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to, and if you listen to the
bags, they're, they're, they're your word
[SPEAKER_01]: of God.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll direct you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just, just keep trying new things,
making mistakes, learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, you know, putting,
putting your, yourself out there to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get this knowledge that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there are incredible people putting
this out nonstop Instagram, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter, Facebook, like all the different
cannabis sites, all the different social
[SPEAKER_01]: medias, like it's amazing how willing
people are in particular with cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: share their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like, we're all super,
like you said, there's this calling that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, not only am I super passionate
about this and making it my life,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have to scream it from the
mountaintops too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like scream it from the
mountaintops.
[SPEAKER_05]: You absolutely have to scream it from the
mountaintops, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, my belief is that the,
that the existence of our species and
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly the existence of the planet is
riding on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you take a look at all the ugly
things that are happening in the world
[SPEAKER_05]: today in people's hearts and minds,
and in the way that we're treating the
[SPEAKER_05]: planet, a wake up call is clearly needed
to start thinking in a different way and
[SPEAKER_05]: acting in a different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know of anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know some other visionary plants,
but yeah, in terms of what's realistic in
[SPEAKER_05]: today's world, I don't know anything else
that's capable of making that change.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the time that we have left,
what is it, 12 years that we supposedly
[SPEAKER_05]: have left to dial down global warming
before it's like not going to be dialed
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're past the point of no return.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So scream it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's what we've been doing all
these years and we just got to keep doing
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the good thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what I've seen here in these two
conferences in Columbia is that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know how under prohibition,
it kept us all isolated into these really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really small communities.
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't be open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we had our own small circles of
tight people that we trusted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that operated on a local level,
it operated on a national level,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with reform actually reaching
multiple different countries around the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We are able to come out of our hiding
places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're able to like say, oh, hey,
you look kind of like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of talk like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You even kind of dress like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, maybe are you in my tribe too,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're seeing this like coming together
of this cannabis tribe that has been
[SPEAKER_05]: existing all around the world for all of
these years, but we've been forced and
[SPEAKER_05]: dispersed into this like hidden diaspora,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're coming out of those hiding
places and we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting each other, linking, linking,
learning, teaching, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That teaching function that we've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you teach correctly,
you're always learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have another meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to grab a picture with you and
Bruce as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be amazing.
We'll see you again, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
