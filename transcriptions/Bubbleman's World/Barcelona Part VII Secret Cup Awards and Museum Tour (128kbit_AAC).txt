Music
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, look who it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hi Mark, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, Todd, very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, what an incredible building.
[SPEAKER_05]: What an incredible space.
[SPEAKER_13]: This place is amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it took 12 years to renovate the
structure after Ben found the place and
[SPEAKER_13]: then he turned it really turned it back
into its original beauty.
[SPEAKER_13]: He brought the original paint back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of painting over it, he just
brought the originality back, the history
[SPEAKER_13]: back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some parts of the building are over 500
years old, that back wall with all of the
[SPEAKER_13]: industrial hemp.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to do a little tour,
bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we got all the books here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Rob's book.
[SPEAKER_13]: You are in the Ota Hashish room,
if you turn around you'll see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your favorite.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the Ota Hashish room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lebanese dry sifting techniques,
sifting with the screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like temples, Nepali, Afghani,
Nepal.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the African pipes, pipes from all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Monster bowls.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a five foot, four foot pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old school Shakespearean style.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old style bowls.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hash brown.
[SPEAKER_12]: Figaro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Little papers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an incredible museum.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just can't explain enough how truly
spectacular it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have done a really incredible job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think people can really fathom or
understand the level of collecting that
[SPEAKER_05]: had to happen before a place like this
could exist, so hats off to Ben for
[SPEAKER_05]: creating such an incredible collection,
preserving such an incredible collection,
[SPEAKER_05]: holding it onto it for so many years,
and then of course being able to display
[SPEAKER_05]: it in a building such as this that they
put so much time and energy to fix up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have David Tini's The Younger,
Peasants Smoking in an Interior,
[SPEAKER_05]: 1660.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's even hemp oils used in the
making of this particular painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the farmers, peasants,
the people, the workers, having a nice
[SPEAKER_05]: night off.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a couple of drinks there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got some herb that they're
burning, and it's post-Columbus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're smoking it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you some of the other beautiful
paintings in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really ancient paintings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these things are very rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: 1600s.
[SPEAKER_05]: David Tenere again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Camilo Inonsenti, Company in a Tavern.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's from the 1900s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's 300 years after these other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about these guys over here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Kristof von Lubiencki, Snuffing Tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just snuffing away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wow, I didn't even see this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea this was here until right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, in between the hemp room and
the pipe room, you have this really
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful little, I mean, I don't know if
it used to be a pond room, really nice
[SPEAKER_05]: area for sitting, setting up the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be a good idea for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, they're very hospitable here at
the museum.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're allowing us to dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're allowing us to enjoy ourselves the
way, of course, we would want to enjoy
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this one, the old classic,
giving the dog a hoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Giving a dog a hoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, this random dude did it 500 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy looks pretty bait, sitting in his
palace, just chilling out, got his hookah
[SPEAKER_05]: next to him, rocking a couple swords.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful sliding doors in this building.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look at that, we have Todd McCormick,
Cannabis Culture Award winner of 2012.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nice to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good dude right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: A true cannabis warrior, a true lover of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always try to support what Todd's trying
to do because, well, he's been doing it
[SPEAKER_05]: for a long time and he's passionate about
it, he's intelligent about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: he's articulate about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think it's really good for the
whole cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at these hemp chairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool little hemp chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: All hemp clothing, shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got composite hemp for plastics in car
doors in Mercedes, hemp skateboards,
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp decorticators, and machines for
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got wheels for spinning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Backstrap eight foot looms for fiber
producing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got the old hemp breakers,
known as the hardest job known to man,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yet you'll only ever see pictures of
women doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Breaking the hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: More hand spinning, more hand breaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you guys, if Bubble Man World
Tours comes to Barcelona and we end up
[SPEAKER_05]: producing a tour for Barcelona,
100% we are going to make this museum a
[SPEAKER_05]: big part of that tour because it really is
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_12]: The room is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we are in a pharmaceutical room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got different bottles from
different timelines, elixirs, sedatives,
[SPEAKER_04]: cough specials, cannabis in different
digitalis, totally in colic and bloat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if your baby's colic here bloated,
you guys are good from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got all sorts of soaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here we have some classical jars that
were held.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sativa extracts and cannabis oil
from different companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simpsons drugstore here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a little card prescribing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, there's some little bait here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prescribing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just all around really neat things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Headache is no joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it with Dr. Miles anti-pill pains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, those pill pains had cannabis in
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here we get into a bit of a
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Bedrocan's weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Bedrocan cannabis floss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bedrocan 5 gram jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can see there's what the
Bedrocan license looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of the cans from Elvi
Musica in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: That comes from Mrs. Hippie, one of the
original cans.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only a few people left that even
receive those, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then other licenses on display.
[SPEAKER_05]: Several forms of vaporizers from the
Vapir, the Volcano, the Aromed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like a verdamper up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They really have covered the gamut in each
room with each subject that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: attempting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, once again, look at the
beautiful display of how he's displaying
[SPEAKER_05]: these bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extract cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extract cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indian cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zinc phosphate with cannabis indica and
hysocyamus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we go, Manor of David Tenier the
Younger.
[SPEAKER_05]: An apothecary, 1673.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are coming in and they're getting
their prescriptions for cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_05]: natural plant compounds and extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are hundreds and hundreds of years
old, some of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Particularly the paintings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspect this is a GW shot of one of the
growers in their massive, massive zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up we have a little bit of sort of
counterculture, you know, that sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: hippie posters, the glass blowing
community, hand-blown glass from the 80s,
[SPEAKER_05]: 90s down to the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a little Ruhr pocket buddy in the
back there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the older books and pins,
you know, stop in the drug war,
[SPEAKER_05]: normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Books about marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another cannabis culture award over here
with Richard Branson, Sir Richard Branson
[SPEAKER_05]: and Thorvald Stoltenberg, member of the
Global Commission on Drug Policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see the place just keeps going
and going and going.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just continue to walk from room to
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: All sorts of different things are covered
in each room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's really an enormous,
enormous amount of information that can be
[SPEAKER_05]: learned just by walking through this
simple, little,
[SPEAKER_05]: just by, yeah, you can see the amazingness
just by watching, walking through this
[SPEAKER_05]: museum, you can catch unbelievable amounts
of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have a busk of William with one
of his style pipes that he would have
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked back in his timeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis user, perhaps, obviously,
if he's in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the Club de Hashishens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alexandre Dumas, Charles Baudelaire,
Eugene Delacroix, Gérald de Nerval,
[SPEAKER_05]: Honoré del Balzac, Theo Falgotier,
and Victor Hugo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is, the members.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some stories on the Hashishens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weary with toil, I haste to my bed,
the dear repost from limbs with travel
[SPEAKER_05]: tired, but then begins a journey in my
head to work my mind when body's work
[SPEAKER_05]: expired from a then my thoughts from far
where I abide in tender zealous pilgrimage
[SPEAKER_05]: to there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you can see some people enjoying
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks as though it's Scythian or
Middle Eastern and basically an old way to
[SPEAKER_05]: vaporize cannabis on coals and drying out
the buds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really nice windows in this place as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sophia apparently has done a lot of the
stained glass window work that you see
[SPEAKER_12]: throughout the museum and it's very
inspirational just to walk around and see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: This looks like the Chris Bennett poster
from his book years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: His name must be in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sex, drugs, violence and the bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bible, there's Chris' book along with
Neil McQueen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shiva, Nathana Haja Shiva.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just keeps going, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here at the Camp Hash
and Air 1 Museum in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Secret Cop people have just gotten
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be doing their awards
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jeremy's here with his crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're setting up their tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've bumped into a few cool guys from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give Martin and Paul a shout out from
Belfast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are doing good work up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course I'm here with Todd McCormick
and Lauren and we came together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just dabbing it out right now,
having a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll try to show you guys a little bit
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is obviously a pretty big oil event
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cannabis event at the same time and
it's a bunch of my friends involved so I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: happy to support Jeremy, support the guys
at Secret Cop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And show what they're doing and how cool
it is that they're getting these events
[SPEAKER_05]: where people can get together and
basically show their wares, smoke together
[SPEAKER_05]: and in the end have a little contest and
maybe hand out a few trophies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Matt the Great Gardener is going to be
here later today too so let's see how the
[SPEAKER_05]: Barb does against the oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Mark, would you like to broadcast this
today?
[SPEAKER_14]: Broadcast it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, we have all the equipment.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just have to go to the car and get
whatever gear you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an opportunity if you like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if we do broadcast it, let's
broadcast it for like an hour maximum,
[SPEAKER_05]: not the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like the main kind of hour.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do the awards if you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get rid of these and maybe even like... I
just don't want to have it to where...
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well these are definitely gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get rid of these.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh here we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Secret Cop Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, it's 420 here at the Marijuana
Hemp and Hash Museum's Secret Cup
[SPEAKER_05]: Gathering and I figure I was going to hit
some full melt dry sift canatonic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to go to HQ, HQ comes to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it, it's really cool looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wicked man, tab that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name's Killer Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh nice, here we'll check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got everyone representing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Representing Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Javier's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finland's in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
So I like it more so than it's in the same
sort of street.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey everyone, this is Tru from Tru
Canagenetics and also D-Lad at the Hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: Museum for the Secret Cup Awards at
Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been tiring but it's been a lot of
fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright guys, what's going on here at the
Secret Cup?
[SPEAKER_08]: Having a fucking blast out in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out here there, in their destruction.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's here there, maybe on the stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here hanging in the Secret Cup
Barcelona waiting to see who gets the
[SPEAKER_10]: first place, second place, third place and
not solving.
[SPEAKER_10]: Secret Dabbing at Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Secret Cup David.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best cup in Barcelona right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just had the pure turps brought
over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice turpene content right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real nice color on those turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real nice smell on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably do a little dipping and
I'll let you know how it turns out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramon from OCD Labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are we at buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp Museum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp Museum for?
[SPEAKER_05]: For Secret Cup though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been puffing your own dry sift
haven't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff what are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make some rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: More rosin?
[SPEAKER_05]: More rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And who are we making rosin with?
[SPEAKER_05]: With Mark Emery and Joe Di Emery.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the Emerys taking pictures of each
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well as you can see the Secret Cup here is
just blowing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's tons of great people in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally cool group of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just bumped into the Emerys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good friends of mine from British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to do some rosin for Mark
and Joe Di.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've never heard of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm totally new over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So essentially think about it like you're
turning the resin heads right into a
[SPEAKER_10]: liquid and they will be pushed out from
the side of the pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah it looks like a good size pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean off a little bit of the leaf and the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll put that in there and get it
photographed somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the table.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah you can unplug the phone totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to get power.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can go upside down too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: She got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Sarah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sticked it into the details.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sticked it into the details.
[SPEAKER_10]: No no no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just into the plug.
[SPEAKER_10]: Into the plug and wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been something.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are thinking at the display.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck people are doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_08]: No way.
[SPEAKER_05]: The original paint.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know he didn't paint over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had it revealed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah that's original.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's not like popping popping.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have it repainted.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had it unveiled.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how much more money it is to
uncover stuff than to just paint it over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: True restoration.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got this bud here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've got these things.
Pretty rip and hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting it up to temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a true testament to how much resin
is on the bud too because.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you come over here and you go
like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a little tiny dab on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try it again.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't say much.
[SPEAKER_10]: No no.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it depends.
[SPEAKER_10]: It varies from bud to bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's a lot of resin on the bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah like the other day someone gave us a
beautiful bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: We squeezed the dab out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then someone else gave us a bud and we
got like three dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the oil now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little bits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I squeezed it for the first time really
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's made for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the bud should be made for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah which is what you'd expect out of a
bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: A small little bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be when he collects it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here collect it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to show it to him with hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to try dabbing it Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: Collect it for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: The parchment paper is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah parchment and the slick sheet oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just picks the resin up beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see all the dabs gathering now on the
edge of the.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right that's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gets you to hold this pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a dabinator from Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was on a bud like ten seconds ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now Mark's dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the part that really is surprising
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you just dabbed that bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well that was an interesting process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well think of how many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was definitely one good hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: From that same amount of bud I've seen
three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three times same as me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great way to test bud if you're
buying pounds as a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great way as a breeder to test
terpy and oil content.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a compassion club buying pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see the resin content.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeeze a bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can weigh the bud before you squeeze
it Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you weigh the bud after you
squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you find out the weight of resin on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to try with a moist bud that's
moist and given to us by someone else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moist bud okay.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: More pressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw him yesterday together.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This technique was from a bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah from a fresh bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it went blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright here we go again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeezing buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeezing buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Giving you anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Little bits here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I better drink that water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to follow the kid on
Instagram who really came up with the idea
[SPEAKER_05]: of squishing buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Soyl Grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be fair to say that you took the
bud apart into little pieces?
[SPEAKER_05]: He does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_05]: The smaller the pieces the more you get
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He uses a t-shirt press and puts like 12
buds in at a time with big sheets of
[SPEAKER_05]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to make it with hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can do it with nice hash too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do hash after this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It turns a low grade hash into high grade
oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well this is nice grade hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: We turn it into higher grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Highest grade oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Highest grade oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that's on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems small but a dab is small.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fresh never comes off as nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The water makes it stick a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every bud is unique like a snowflake.
[SPEAKER_05]: True.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the way you said that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every bud is unique like a snowflake.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I heard it as everybody's unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she said every bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every bud is unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hear that they found snowflakes that
aren't the same actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice case you got there buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys met Javier?
[SPEAKER_05]: Javier is from Medical Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Jody and Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I met with you one day and the last time
you stayed here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time you come here if you want to
find a good bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_05]: She couldn't find any good bud when she
comes to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: She can't find nice pods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's being dabbed and boiled these
days too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the nice?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's dabbing it out Javi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You make an Instagram post over there
Mark?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a hair straightener?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a woman's hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they call them?
[SPEAKER_05]: A flat iron.
[SPEAKER_05]: A flat iron, right of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff knows that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just in a bud in your pocket that
you might not have even popped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian girls wouldn't laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, all of a sudden every girl's calling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, let's rosin up a piece in the
screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to do it with the screen though
after this next piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the name of that nail?
[SPEAKER_05]: I already got hijacked.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the name of that nail?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll use that in a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the middle of using that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the middle of using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but we're in the middle of using
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm filming a video of us making it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll make that too, but right after he
does this piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that nail brand?
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's called, well the electric nail
is called Dabinator and it's in a
[SPEAKER_05]: mothership pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but something pretty nice
that someone gave me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll do the hash, the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, we need two of these red ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch the hash mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to miss this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in one of my bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's actually in my suitcase
that's either in that room or in Todd's
[SPEAKER_05]: car.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the hash in a little ball here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I balled it up in one of Mark's.
[SPEAKER_10]: One,
[SPEAKER_08]: two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, we can already see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we taste that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see what I'm saying, Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you see the value of the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd wants a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd wants a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you got 50% out of the hash and he
probably squeezed 50% of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would need to try that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable the first time you see
it open.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cans of speed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was excellent, but we have to clean the
bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another squeeze or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: School of Isolator.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They teach everybody how to make this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the School of Isolator.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we got this going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second squeeze, see what we get.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so fresh and so new, Mark is
literally sharing it with the world right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, honestly, how much did it blow your
mind to get out of prison and have a smart
[SPEAKER_05]: phone put into your hand?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's worth for me because the judge banned
me from having a phone of my own.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have one for like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the brick or from the little flip
razor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, this technology, whatever you
want to call it, is still in its primitive
[SPEAKER_06]: stages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's using a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it turns into using different
temperatures and finding different
[SPEAKER_06]: activation levels, I mean, it's so much
potential.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from my perspective, I can tell you
for a fact, this is definitely less than
[SPEAKER_05]: half of what I gave you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got more than 50% return out of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, now we have the dry sift to
rosin up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll go right from Bud, water hash to
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he's up next.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever you would like, rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Put in that rock or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put in too much, it's not
efficient, I find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put what you want right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to share with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just turning it into dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many dabs would you like?
[SPEAKER_05]: As many as we can get.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much did you put in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Twist it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a secret cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Represent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing this with food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you feel the high is smoking
de-carved weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not so de-carved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything you smoke is de-carved because
when you burn it, you de-carve oxalate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This temperature is not enough to
de-carve.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why when Jeff had his test right
here, 75% of the TNC was acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing this in our villa.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just taking the bottle and putting
it in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turpenes are an extremely cautious,
claustrophobic volatile terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to take a photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like these mini screens though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, we'll get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that fact that keriophil is present in
the test means that the key, obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: in there, it would be the first one to be
gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure, the terpenes are being affected,
but activated and destroyed, not
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the scientific perspective,
when you test the material after you do
[SPEAKER_05]: it, de-carve oxalation doesn't generally
take two minutes unless you use five or
[SPEAKER_05]: six hundred degrees plus of heat,
which is like when you burn a joint or
[SPEAKER_05]: take a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is five, ten seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should dab that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Line them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a fine balance with this
technique, but when you upscale it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What about doing it without the screen?
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want the pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your contaminant runs with the oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give it back to you in a
second.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just wants to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a picture of this pipe?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just give you a little dunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little dunk will do you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll give you the carb cap as
well because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, boss?
[SPEAKER_05]: Manitoba in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see my Facebook feed today and in it
there's this giant fucking dude bench
[SPEAKER_05]: pressing a guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, look at these fucking
maniacs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I look again and it's my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who were you bench pressing?
[SPEAKER_05]: You were powerlifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was squatting hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: They said I couldn't squat a hundred
pounds, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy had to weigh more than a hundred
pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a 200 pound dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put on his shoulders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Manitoba, representatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys just went through the full Rawson
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can squeeze a dab out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we squeeze a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Nugs, you know him?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually got to try the dry sift from
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Bobby Nugs got the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you offered Bobby Nugs the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was around me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been my hood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Bobby.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope he's doing better, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get him... Much love.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the worries that I have with
him that I keep, that I've been telling
[SPEAKER_05]: him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he doesn't know what's wrong with
his lungs.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I want him to just smoke the safest
possible product as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he has lung problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: This asthma thing knocking him out,
putting him in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's serious shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like... My girl was extremely
scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was supposed to come on hash church
that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got basically sent to the hospital
instead.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was supposed to have a party that
night.
[SPEAKER_05]: He never showed up until we got on Rhode
Island.
Brutal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I take a tiny little bit of that and
squeeze it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll have a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you make me a dab of the strawberry
banana?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let me just give a little squish on
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, squish that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just lining things up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting things into the queue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how I do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the queue man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makin' Rosentek.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makin' Rosentek with Reverend,
Cannabis Reverend, Jeff Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Team Manitoba, Team Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Team Seattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: New voice, Team Seattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Team Ontario, and Team Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I said Team Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're representin'.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, how we doin'?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dry-sipped again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'll tell you what, way more
coming out of this than came out of
[SPEAKER_10]: Ramone's, but Ramone had already robbed
all the nice 99s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you squeeze it, open it so the camera
can see it each time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the money shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm talkin' about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero parts per million.
[SPEAKER_05]: No vac oven, no purging, and no butane.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's a little bit of a lighter
hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is under the bottom of the
grinder, is that what I saw you guys use?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is now dry-sipped rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, if you take a picture of it,
I would suggest doing this, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: holding it up into the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be makin' dry-sip, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cleanin' that shit off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice,
[SPEAKER_05]: congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had my third.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be happy, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, representin' on Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I thought you lost your bag there for
a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a water and it's gone now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't know which one's mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Todd.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Todd.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of new faces, but the family's still
the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to see the movement so strong
all the way overseas.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys for the passion that you
have for cannabis and for being a part of
[SPEAKER_11]: the event.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank everybody for being here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna move right into the awards.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to say a couple things.
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes a special thing to make a secret
cup happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of people that put in their
effort here, you might not realize how
[SPEAKER_11]: many people have really given of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_11]: He really made it possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much to him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our first award is gonna be for best
solventless.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have a really strong solventless
scene out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems like it's maybe even better than
what we have in the States.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to try many, many good solventless
hashes out here and some traditional ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, really great.
[SPEAKER_11]: The winner of the best solventless is
Medical Hunter Medical Seeds, number 16.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say something about your passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell everybody what you entered.
[SPEAKER_07]: My interest is that I can speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: The variety with which we have won is No
Name.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a cheese-cone-green-white-salt cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wafers we have used have been bubble
bath in an extraction of 73 microns,
[SPEAKER_07]: made with water and ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I can say.
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of the strain is No Name.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cross is cheese-cone-green-white-salt.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bags I use are bubble bath bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: The microns are 73 microns and the process
is water and ice.
The next prize is for best butter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we would have more butter,
but the shower scene is strong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some very, very good butters were entered.
[SPEAKER_11]: The highest scoring butter, Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I entered Amicia from La Colada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really nice win.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a really nice butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it Boston Joy.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next award is the Connoisseur's
Choice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone here got to vote on what they
think the best hash is, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_11]: scores, regardless of anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hash you guys chose is the best from
the whole event.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next award is QI Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes!
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do the top three prizes
overall now.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the ones that move on to the
finals at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_11]: This place is going to get a rig and also
an e-nail, but unfortunately our trophy
[SPEAKER_11]: torches and pendants are stuck in customs.
[SPEAKER_11]: The winner will also receive those things
as well, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: The third place, BJ Extracts, number 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 13 was a Skywalker OG, Nedra,
Lil' D-Wax, Dry Scroll Back, and a Cross
[SPEAKER_00]: International.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So second place,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's called DemoraTree.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now for number one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a lot of really good stuff entered.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really want to thank everybody for
putting forward their best effort.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt like we got a really good batch of
different kinds of hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is also the best shatter as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: It usually happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: For number one best shatter and number one
overall, the winner of the whole secret
[SPEAKER_11]: cup, Team 10 Extracts, number 14.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not here, but it is a place down at
the DemoraTree.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to say something about what he
entered, or do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a Karma Genetics,
Headbanger, ECS Ski Cross, Piper Push.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite of the trip as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merry Christmas.
Thank you guys for coming.
You're welcome to stay.
We're open till 9.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barcelona, done for now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep watching Bogeyman's World.
Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
