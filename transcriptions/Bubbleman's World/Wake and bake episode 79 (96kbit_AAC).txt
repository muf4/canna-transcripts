[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we did it, we made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Wake and Bake episode 79
and welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these apps, they're kind of
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like going on live and doing it
through Google Chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely giving me a hard time
each and every time I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm live, but no one is in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, hey, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some peeps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I gotta go into my channel here,
go into my live events, and well,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to delete the one that I already,
I think I started three this morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: so let me go into live streaming and see
how many are there, and right on,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, you found me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see ya, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, there we go, wakey bakey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looked like a funny, funny face on that
particular photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everyone's doing well, and yes,
have a wonderful Chalice weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Chalice is this weekend,
down in San Bernardino, always a big
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would be cool to be able to get down there
one time, although I hear it's very hot
[SPEAKER_01]: down there at this time of year,
35 to 40 degrees Celsius, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoo, in the 100 plus degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be a little bit hot for me,
but yeah, I'm glad it worked out to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: buds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to have a couple of words
with you guys, have a couple of puffs with
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys, and then call it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yesterday I went over to the
Sunshine Coast, and met with the Team
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese guys, Yoshi, and Jun,
and, oh, Dice, Daiko?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't remember the third guy's name,
and then John Green was there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Dosa was there, and of course,
High Integrity Glass Art was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some really great photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little bit of video of those guys
making their magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try and go back in about a week
when they finish up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosa's super chill, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosa, we met like we've known each other
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't even introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, hey, dude, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, bro, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of the weirdness of Instagram
and social media, where you just feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting Dosa truly was like meeting a
friend that you've known for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever met anyone like
that, in fact, that it was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, what's up, dude, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like, oh, hey, this is Dosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosa, this is Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just knew, so very cool on that angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice guy, great glass blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave me, I wish I had it on me,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left it upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave me a really beautiful little merini.
[SPEAKER_01]: I photographed some of them and put it up
on the post yesterday on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us wake the bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, why wasn't it working for me just a
moment ago, Graham McCollum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why not go through this a third
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is, I guess when you run your
computer and you do live chats through the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer, through Google, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through Google Chat and then it
forces itself through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do it on the phone, it actually
works a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phone is a little bit jacked,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go to go live, often it'll go
three, two, one, and then my phone goes
[SPEAKER_01]: black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when this happens, oh, don't worry
about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed out and I want you to hear the
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your bad at all, don't worry
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that happens, I have to start it
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's been happening is a glitch
lately that when I start it over and I go
[SPEAKER_01]: to resume the chat, it's vertical and I'm
OCD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't have a wake and bake video where
it's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have to do is I have to stop that
one, go in and restart a whole new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I have to do two, three,
four per day, per morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's easier if I go back and I
find the ones that were already there and
[SPEAKER_01]: delete those ones, but just making it
easier for people to find the actual chat
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're in because if I start three or
four, sometimes people are in one that are
[SPEAKER_01]: not actually moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is that there's a bit of a
glitch and that's because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: streaming and encoders that are needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go through Google, it does
everything for you, but when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: through your phone, I guess it's using
just the YouTube app and the encoder for
[SPEAKER_01]: the YouTube app is a little bit glitchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I tried putting a little
tussin' on it, rubbin' a little tussin' on
[SPEAKER_01]: my phone there, but so far it hasn't
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have to get that super tussin'.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the crystal should have been taped to
the hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have taped it right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure, a few people said they didn't
get their crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to get their crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to have a big bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this bong?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Nate Dizzle, Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love me a Swiss Perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm hittin' the tussin'.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, this bong could almost be 10
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very likely, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hittin' sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's why the rips look bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, Graham.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did see the weird guy Roland rip in my
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent a little thing in today saying,
hey, these are my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, human nature, doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature am I hitting at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am hitting at 590.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was Darren Sift, the one that I
just hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one I hit is gonna be Sunrises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of a different color on the
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Darren's is a little bit darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a bit darker, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome plans for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a good call that I have to
make in regards to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to find out what's going on there
and get an update for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to try and edit the video
that I filmed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta hope that I filmed all the parts
and get to fit it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's gonna be a 15 minute
video or a 30 minute video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did film a lot, but I didn't really
interview the glass blowers, them being
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese and not speaking the best of
English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yoshi I probably could have done an
interview with, but I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: bother them and they were in crush mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to pull them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt actually bad just standing behind
them trying to film because the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing is so intricate and so
detailed that the last thing I want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is be responsible for causing any upsets
in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filmed all three of the Japanese glass
blowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filmed Dosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I interviewed John Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I took a couple of puffs out of
the Kevin Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That video will go up, I'm hoping today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah exactly Tyler, that's kind of what I
was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we'd love to see them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron said yes to the greenhouse project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just in the middle of waiting to
hear from the greenhouse companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese glass for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching them do their thing was really
impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to going back in the next
five days when they're finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be the entire two weeks that
they're at the house that this is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday they crushed a dual sided
pendant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just absolutely unbelievable in how much
detail these guys are able to put into
[SPEAKER_01]: their glass and the process of watching
them do it absolutely blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there is a big cannabis culture
in Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: John was telling me who lives there and
helps facilitate the Japanese glass
[SPEAKER_01]: blowers here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He speaks Japanese and he can sort of get
them what they need and keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that they're selling glass and
they're selling one hitters and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: head shops and this that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing at the same time,
he says the cops can stop you anytime they
[SPEAKER_01]: want and they can search you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government is definitely against ja
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not using cannabis medically to
promote the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb is illegal and expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe 30, 40 dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was saying the other day, he's like I
miss my waking bakes because he just loves
[SPEAKER_01]: waking up and getting high and he can't do
that in Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah of course Ron said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta get rid of Ron's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta get him moved over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta find Ron a new house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta buy a green house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta build a green house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna take us some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a couple of months to get this
project going because let's be honest it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just one of many.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not the main project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I bet Chuck Liddell said the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most anyone that's traveled to Japan will
say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful country and beautiful people and
culture and love the food and but the
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-herb sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got my record my lawyer basically
told me the two countries you shouldn't go
[SPEAKER_01]: to are America and oh glad you received
the bubble bags illegal cannabis farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: of Canada and Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said those two places will be your
biggest problems with the felony record of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis possessions so best to just avoid
those two countries which sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to avoid any.
[SPEAKER_01]: No he does not want to live in the coots.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in the coots and he's leaving the
coots but thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna figure out his own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably gonna be personal what he
figures out so I might not be sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what he's done with his house but
he's gonna figure something out with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and get it taken care of sell it I don't
know but he's gonna get up here we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna find him another house and then
we're gonna start this greenhouse project
[SPEAKER_01]: so I pray that it starts sooner than
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have loved to have been starting
it in you know March to get it all going
[SPEAKER_01]: by April May but instead it'll be the way
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly Jan I live in one of the most
beautiful places I've ever seen as well
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've traveled all over the world to I
don't know 25 or 26 countries not that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that many considering there's 218
or 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I won't be telling you exactly where
Ron lives but you're welcome to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh that's okay stoner Smurf listen always
ask questions never feel bad the worst
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is is it might not be answered or
you might hear a reply that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean you shouldn't have asked
your question when you hear a reply that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of oh that's not what I wanted
to hear in return sometimes people get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little like oh sorry it's like don't be
sorry you asked a question that's cool we
[SPEAKER_01]: should all be allowed to ask questions
just like we should all be allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer questions in the way that we see
fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you live in Jamaica or Spain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah I could do Barcelona I could do
the countryside I will do Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent a lot of time in Jamaica you
know like really a lot of time over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of the last 20 years I may have
spent a year of my life in Jamaica so I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to go there for six seven weeks at a
time and that was really nice getting
[SPEAKER_01]: those trips in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Melt you know there's so many things
going on in Jamaica right now that I love
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of I have no idea if that's true
you'd have to look it up in regards to a
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanish person that might know the Spanish
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product in Jamaica is like anywhere
it's hard to find but it's great if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can find it the majority of the stuff is
not great and it's not exciting and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not you know just like anywhere if you go
into a dispensary or if you go into you
[SPEAKER_01]: know buy herbs anywhere it's always the
same like most is not that exciting and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit is super exciting and it's
that's the way it always is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I'll be trying to get into
the USA anytime I thought about it I won't
[SPEAKER_01]: lie I thought about it oh geez who was I
supposed to shout out today Andrew and
[SPEAKER_01]: Katie Harrison SSS that's who I'm shouting
out I had a nice email from a woman
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday who said her husband was kind of
bummed out and a little down and out and
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could just give him a call it would
cheer him up and I thought wow what and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just said that morning you know if you can
make someone's day better by giving them a
[SPEAKER_01]: smile or helping them in some small way
wouldn't it be a good thing to do and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: got the email later that day saying hey I
was actually with the team Japan guys and
[SPEAKER_01]: so she sent me this email she said her
husband was down and out he was having
[SPEAKER_01]: some problems some health problems and
lost his job and sent me his phone number
[SPEAKER_01]: and man I had such a great conversation
with this guy I called him up I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: hey bro what's up and he's like he
answered he answered just like this and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like hey dude what's up and he's like
who's this and I'm like it's bubble man
[SPEAKER_01]: bro what's going on and he he's just like
what what do you mean what are you talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about I was like dude it's fucking bubble
man dude I'm calling you up it's waking
[SPEAKER_01]: bakes it's bubble man attached church it's
bubble bags it's like I don't know don't
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and yeah SSS man he was so he was
such a nice guy and it was so amazing to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to help inspire someone because
you have to understand I don't feel in any
[SPEAKER_01]: way shape or form that I that I that I'm
special I just felt like in that moment
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was doing the right thing and if I
if somehow I was making this guy's day by
[SPEAKER_01]: by talking to him I mean what the fuck is
this world come to that we can't share our
[SPEAKER_01]: time with one another that people have to
feel like it's a special occasion if
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who has a bunch of followers on
Instagram gives them time it's just fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: up so yeah it made me feel as good as it
made him feel I won't lie really did and I
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like I was able to give him some
inspirational words you know he felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: he was in this obstacle zone and losing
his job and being sick and I was just like
[SPEAKER_01]: bro those are your opportunities that's
the end energy that is feeling so intense
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you go down into it you're gonna
be super bummed out but if you can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: flip it around you're gonna have this
incredible rocket launcher boost of power
[SPEAKER_01]: that can set you off on the next vision
that clearly you manifested in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place because you didn't want to work as a
construction worker anymore and you
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't quit so you ended up manifesting
subconsciously this other experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: took you away from your career so I want
to give a big shout out to Katie and SSS
[SPEAKER_01]: what a nice person what great people I
didn't talk to her for very long I just
[SPEAKER_01]: heard her voice in the background but I'll
tell you the guy was the real deal just a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice person and maybe having a little bit
of problem problems in his life and
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling a little down and it made me feel
good to be able to lift him up a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and I hope you're listening SSS I hope
you got you're having a better day today
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll tell you that you made my day a
better day yesterday by being a part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: so thank you brother in the meantime I
think it's time for feeding our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid systems have you fed your
endocannabinoid system today I know I have
[SPEAKER_01]: all right actually we're gonna go for the
other stuff well it's the right thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do and it's nice and it just feels good
and in the end well okay here's another
[SPEAKER_01]: cool story survivor who came in the other
day and I decided to give him the the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle of DC glass cleaner he sent me a
really cool email says he's super good
[SPEAKER_01]: friends with vital garden supply guys and
says if you want I'll help get them on
[SPEAKER_01]: hash church and in like three emails back
and forth and he's got buddy from vital
[SPEAKER_01]: garden supply who Tony has talked about
and supported in the past and who I've
[SPEAKER_01]: only heard great things about he's gonna
come talk about soil on hash church you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all because of that experience of
that just sort of stepping outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: box if we're looking for things to be
different in our lives why don't we change
[SPEAKER_01]: them step outside of the box do something
you might not have done do something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a little bit you know not the
everyday step out of your norm and so for
[SPEAKER_01]: me stepping out of my norm the other day
and deciding that the guy who said hey did
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss the giveaway am I late you know I
got to give him that thing and in turn he
[SPEAKER_01]: gave back this beautiful energy and and
because of it you are all gonna benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: because now Brian from vital garden supply
is gonna come and he's gonna school us on
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and he's gonna we're gonna have a
great conversation so and then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: SSS was the same thing he just he just
made me the everyone in this world has
[SPEAKER_01]: something to offer and you it more
importantly have something to offer them
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that I often think that fame
is how they hijack it they try to make
[SPEAKER_01]: certain people famous so that everyone's
focused on those people while missing the
[SPEAKER_01]: true people that they've manifested into
their life through whatever form of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: or or what have you those are the people
you're supposed to be meeting and they
[SPEAKER_01]: might not look like you know the movie
star the rock star they might just be an
[SPEAKER_01]: everyday person and don't miss that
opportunity because you yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: manifested that person into your life what
a horrible hell to be trapped in to
[SPEAKER_01]: subconsciously manifesting the energies
and the people that you need in your life
[SPEAKER_01]: and constantly blowing them off and
missing the missing the mark how fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I'll tell ya hey thanks Christian
much appreciated with the kind words much
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated yeah you know you know I mean
don't get me wrong some people rub me the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong way and I have a I have this crazy
energy with and but for the most part I
[SPEAKER_01]: try to understand that all the people that
come across my path I myself have
[SPEAKER_01]: manifested them into my life and you know
I learned that through getting busted and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking getting busted was the worst
thing ever and then sort of transferring
[SPEAKER_01]: that energy into starting bubble bags
which was like the best thing ever for me
[SPEAKER_01]: and my family it's just been a wonderful
great thing and it all came through this
[SPEAKER_01]: through this obstacle that everyone I can
assure you was all on the same page saying
[SPEAKER_01]: this was bad very very bad and that's how
we feel you know we feel that and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you when I told SSS yesterday listen
bro you probably manifested losing your
[SPEAKER_01]: job but because you were so stubborn in
your life you would have just held on to
[SPEAKER_01]: that job for the next 50 years I said now
you're going to be able to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: reality for yourself where you're not just
doing something that you have to do or
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're good at but something that you
want to do and that's you know the law of
[SPEAKER_01]: attraction there it is the first time I
ever saw that law of attraction my wife
[SPEAKER_01]: and I we were laughing about it because my
wife is like that's what you've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: since I've known you I'm like hell yeah oh
yeah I fully believe in manifesting your
[SPEAKER_01]: reality well there's no doubt about it
it's all done through the choices that you
[SPEAKER_01]: make but more importantly through the
thoughts that you think through the words
[SPEAKER_01]: that you project and through the actions
that you display through those three
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations and they are like a ladder
one step comes before the other they lead
[SPEAKER_01]: into these manifestations and I just you
know it's it's hard to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes but even you know I guess what
it is is it's kind of like outside of good
[SPEAKER_01]: and bad do we need trustworthy what's that
what's that pharmacy bro do we need
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthy hands and 20 years experience
in Cali yeah quite possibly dude hit me up
[SPEAKER_01]: bro I'd love to have a talk with you
there's things that I would love to have
[SPEAKER_01]: done in California one of the things is I
would love to find the quality material
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously we have access to some but this
is an opportunity for everyone to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this in the sense that whoever has
the the the top the the the 10 out of 10
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to wash your material we want to
turf your material we want to process your
[SPEAKER_01]: material we want to promote your brand
because that's what bubble bags is all
[SPEAKER_01]: enough is all about we're not about
there's nothing without the grower so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking for great growers and if you
can help facilitate some of that that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a great way for us to you know
