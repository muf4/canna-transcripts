[SPEAKER_01]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're from SRC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh okay, I'm from CRD and you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an MOU with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you guys have the booth set up all
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrodistillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about hydro
distillation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh okay, it's actually a process by which,
one of the processes by which you extract
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils from plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hydro because you're using water
and you're distilling the oils which are
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is that you immerse your
plants and it can be either fresh or it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be either dried material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You immerse it in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that boils, the essential oils come
up as a vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They condense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the coil, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect in the bottom jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an oil trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's lighter than the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it floats on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what about, I'm not a scientist,
but I know that anytime we heat something,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly volatile oils like terpenes
and terpenoids, that potentially we're
[SPEAKER_01]: changing their structures and producing
artifacts of their true molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so the heat source is controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's controlled heat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually adjust the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get the oils up at very low
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this done under a vacuum as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to be, it's all just open?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always get the quality of your
oil when you're finished using GC,
[SPEAKER_01]: GCMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, or even the proton HNMR I believe
that they have at UWE.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the viewers on my channel will
really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause right now there's a few people in
the community that I live in, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are desperately trying to figure
out how to extract the terpenes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously this is a great way to start the
ball rolling and then start using your
[SPEAKER_01]: head to figure out, okay, how can I
protect these volatile oils that are
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporating at room temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to apply heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great if we could do it under
a vacuum under a much colder conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: and still get the same job done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
