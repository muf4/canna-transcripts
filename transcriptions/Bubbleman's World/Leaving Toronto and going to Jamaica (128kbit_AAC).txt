[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, holy shit, John and I have slept
like two hours, and we are now in our town
[SPEAKER_00]: car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna head over to the airport
to catch this flight to Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we made it to the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing our thing before we get on the
plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to bury the trippy stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buried the stick, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buried the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, you got your bubble bags there,
John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we taking some 20-gallon bags to
Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our carry-on, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of carry-on, so... I don't
know, I guess we're gonna go hook up with
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends that we're flying into
Kingston with, so a couple more rips and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're puffing all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was gonna say is that's why it's
bad that you're going to be in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom is the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you will still be able to work
with our friends.
For our company.
Johnny has thought of that.
I
love it!
I love it!
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it!
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man, John B., Claude, and Ashley in
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know your name, but... Kelly
helped us.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was our protocol agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: She helped us clear through customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made the experience very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're gonna head outside and start
the trip to Jamaica!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, boys?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was blackout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, blackout.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just jumped right on that truck from
the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even see the green bucket
until I was looking at the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man here in Spanish town,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prezi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prezi, you're on the phone with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're grabbing some ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prezi and I are getting some ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this party ice time at Prezi?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be partying with this ice real
soon, so I'm gonna grab a bunch of bags
[SPEAKER_00]: with Prezi and we'll see you guys when we
get where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are with the Bubble Man right now,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to start some history right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we are about to start some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been driving around for the last...
Three hours, maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say two to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to find these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not easy to find in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got one, but good luck finding
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finding one to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We managed to find two because,
of course, we're with Prezi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you ask Prezi to find you a
bucket, he's gonna find us a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we're on our way now to the
place where I think we're gonna be meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends and then heading over to the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps they'll already have the herb
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, we're gonna be making bubble
real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just landed in Jamaica about five or
six hours ago, so let's see how fast we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get to mixing up the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
