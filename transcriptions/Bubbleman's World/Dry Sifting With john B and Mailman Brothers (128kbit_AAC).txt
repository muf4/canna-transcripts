[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, welcome to Bumbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting back with some good buddies today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got John B on the left here with some of
his beautiful, wonderful cannabis that he
[SPEAKER_01]: grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the dry-sift screens that
we're going to be using today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Further left, my good buddy Morgan,
that's my backcountry shred buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to have you here, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got the Mailman brothers here
from Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Ryan and Mike, and they're out from
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the good work out there
promoting medical cannabis and promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as health benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're super stoked to have them here
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, shit, we should probably start
with some bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll start with a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you load me up here, John?
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks like some of your dry-sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that would be the... I think
that's the headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headband?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well I'll take a little hit of
the headband through the mothership before
[SPEAKER_01]: we get started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit some freshly... Hey Mark,
first day on Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wear suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowboarding in suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stoked for Whistler opening this
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks before it's supposed to be
opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been, of course John and I will
be at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_01]: about ten days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there every year for the last,
I don't know how many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be the first year that Whistler
opened early enough that I'm actually able
[SPEAKER_01]: to go for opening day, I'd say in about
seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm all about wearing a suit and going
to represent most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I loaded you a little bit of
full-melt bubble hash that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's really going to be about dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go over... I'm going to
tell you, kind of reiterate what I've told
[SPEAKER_01]: you before in some of my past articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much in video, maybe once in the
Tumble Now video.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really today we're working with
the four foot by two foot screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are aluminum frame, tight screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a set of three.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in lines per inch the top number,
the biggest number, which is in microns,
[SPEAKER_01]: say like a 200 micron, in lines per inch
is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll actually be a smaller number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our top screen is 110 lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how silk is measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about 140 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as you get a higher number,
200 lines per inch is the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's about a 70 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our second screen, the one that
we'll do the majority of our cleaning on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the 305, which is the
bottom screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a 40 micron and it's what we do
the last little bit of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So took a little rip and got myself a
little sideways there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so I also not only want to go
about how I like to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean their resin from which they've
extracted initially out of one screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then John's going to tell you guys
also about his method, not so much his
[SPEAKER_01]: method, but the method he's come to
appreciate from working with the screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with the screens over the last
year, I've just found a way of- Being a
[SPEAKER_02]: little gentler.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot gentler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just giving a little finesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically, John's going to use a
single screen and acquire his 90% heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm teaching people how to acquire 70 to
80% contaminant and then clean that up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 to 98% plus heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of, they both are perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got pounds of weed and you can
just run buds, then John's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way John's been doing it and kind of
which is what I'd call a nice gentle,
[SPEAKER_01]: he'll show you in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit different and it's why I like
to talk about it and sort of get it out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that when I'm telling people how to
clean dry sift and then someone like John,
[SPEAKER_01]: who would never do this personally because
I know him, but some guys might be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you don't have to do all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get pure heads just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they come on and they kind of
confuse people and say, oh, you don't got
[SPEAKER_01]: to use all those screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a situation that A,
you're not acquiring sift that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: made, B, you have enough bud that you can
just make as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not in those situations,
then you're in the situation where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to learn how to clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's counterintuitive or
counterproductive to have someone come and
[SPEAKER_01]: tell someone you don't need to learn how
to clean it because wouldn't you agree,
[SPEAKER_01]: how did you learn how to extract gentler?
[SPEAKER_01]: By cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: By cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ryan just got a bubble box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan's learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're feeling it a little bit too,
the counterintuitive process of,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, tell the story about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make your bit of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some hash that I had free extracted
and I thought, you know, we'll just clean
[SPEAKER_02]: it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the story though, the way John,
the way John told it, the way you hit it a
[SPEAKER_01]: few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, do you think it melts yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And John's like, no, you got to work it
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so Ryan gives it like four more
cards and he's like, wait, it's got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: melting now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I laughed and said, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was 25 after eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'm going to come back a quarter
to nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, and you'll probably have like
a hoot left there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he thought, yeah, like 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, quarter nine,
he goes, I think, I think there might be
[SPEAKER_02]: half a hoot left there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cause it's never about what's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always about the purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then he realized that it didn't melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right away he's like right back
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Luke showed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Darren?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another good buddy who's been
absolutely representing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he couldn't get it for about three
months and it's, you'll see why I keep
[SPEAKER_01]: reiterating this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, it does take a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost a finesse to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to get the camera very close
when I start doing the carding work and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can really, I mean, it sounds
silly cause it's, it doesn't, it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: brain surgery, but at the same time,
there is so many different ways to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: improperly that are counter intuitive that
make you do the opposite of what you
[SPEAKER_01]: should really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll probably have a few more bong
rips here while we sit and wait for the
[SPEAKER_01]: next stage, which is getting some of this
herb out of the bag onto the screen.
Probably.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use this herb right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we're going to get some of
this herb onto the screen and John will
[SPEAKER_01]: show some of his process of how he gently
bounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show macro photographs of what can
come out of a single screen bounce when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll also do a little bit of a
more rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to clean through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll clean down to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's not going to be much on
the 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do the majority of the cleaning
on the 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: John's going to show us how he likes to be
a little gentle when he does his first
[SPEAKER_01]: single screen extraction rather than,
you know, rather than how some people are
[SPEAKER_01]: just manhandling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smell the minute he opens this herb,
you can smell it from like 12 feet away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost measured it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 12 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coffee-like smell, really nice and dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, you know, it's a good bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is this bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this some headband?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is, this is, um, oh,
we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're being told is, is it's a soma
diesel crossed with a cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a very cushy smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very cushy, very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically how I have been able to
manage my pain control is by doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about this is how I do
this is I just basically, um, I'm cleaning
[SPEAKER_02]: up with the way I trim my weed and,
uh, I kind of ever so gently and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: already see hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just from moving the nuggets out
of the way, you can definitely see a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of heads and capitate stocks and also
pistol at hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a lot of orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is the first screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna, you know, a lot of the good
stuff is going to fall, fall right
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So delicate way to get some pure heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to have the hands on a pouch,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I start breaking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As everybody knows, I slowly just kind of
break these apart as you can hear them
[SPEAKER_02]: snapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're definitely dry enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important do you believe the dryness
and the humidity, humidity content is to
[SPEAKER_01]: proper dry sifting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've, I've came across quite a bit
where I've actually done it right,
[SPEAKER_02]: right from fresh off the stock,
not fresh, but you know, hung like for
[SPEAKER_02]: six, seven days and done a balance with it
and had some great medicine and then call
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff and go, dude, it went all fucking
gummy on me right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it really comes down to
developing that tricone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hey, you gotta, I hang dry and then I
got to cure it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people ask me all the time,
does it need to be dry to dry sift?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, the first word in dry
sift is dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it might seem a little
ridiculous, but truly that it's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really, I mean, you can go
different ways of using frozen bud and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's dry ice methods and whatnot,
but it extracts an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the hands on approach to sort of
the old school screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the tumbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the bubble box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is kind of a growers tool
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this isn't for your guy at home
that smokes a couple of joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tool for me getting my,
my perfect medicine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work great to hang your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're hanging your plants,
make sure you have these three screens
[SPEAKER_02]: under your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you, you know, those four by
eight tables, I have two of these set up
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hang or top and that's where I do
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I always have this wicked
full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many heads are lost in transport and in
tights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Touching and in bagging and in all these
processes that he's completely avoiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just cutting them down and hanging
them over this screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way he could possibly take it a
step further is to grow his plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: screens like this, just under them at all
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've discussed that and you know,
cool to have a floor made of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many times that I'm walking in
my garden, I brush up against it and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bring a fresh bug, we take a picture
and he goes, yeah, but you knocked off
[SPEAKER_02]: half of the resin heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take all the heads off the stocks
and then it'll leave like three red
[SPEAKER_01]: fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a horrific, like a
catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he really started understanding
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you can see, all of that basically
families are starting to come off and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just slowly do this and I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of resin underneath
here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's still a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What John is doing is he's really
acquiring the one to 2% of like the best
[SPEAKER_01]: heads on these buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are the biggest,
the most mature, the most eager to
[SPEAKER_01]: release, those will be the ones that are
the easiest to isolate from the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the chafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the smaller contaminants and the
smaller heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it definitely is very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure John can attest when he first
brought his dry sift by and I cleaned it
[SPEAKER_01]: up for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an eye-opener, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that Medi was so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, oh, then we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, then we cleaned it that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to insert photos while we're
doing this today and sort of show you the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to do photos of a single screen
extraction, but what we're going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: you for sure is the process of actually
the second screen, what it looks like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't just bounce pure nugget,
when you get like a higher contaminant
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio, maybe like 50, 60, 70% contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you the photos of how it
takes five to 10 minute increments of
[SPEAKER_01]: carding that material over the second,
the 70 screen, the second screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how long it takes to actually get it
to purify before you start seeing like
[SPEAKER_01]: less of these stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show those photos while we're
talking about this process and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: really see what it is we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're talking about is we're first
extracting the glandular trichomes from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant matter, but the trichome itself,
oh, it's the chainsaw guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a break right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the chainsaw guy, okay, we're going
to start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chainsaw guy is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is we're, there he
goes again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have the chainsaw guy up
here a little bit later on and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have a puff with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy and it's okay that he's
chainsawing in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did wait an hour to do this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: He promised he'd be done in three,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love Steve, the chainsaw guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I was saying is that the
chainsaw is very loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost 420 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to do when we say we're
isolating the gland heads, first we take
[SPEAKER_01]: the herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're isolating the glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about the chainsaw is now
done, we're going to try this a third
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about isolating the trichomes
from the plant, that's going to get us the
[SPEAKER_01]: glandular trichome head, the capitate
stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The systolic hair and potentially some
small particles of pistilid hairs or
[SPEAKER_01]: broken, immature heads and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, that's what I call a single
screen farmer's sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, what we want to do is we want
to isolate the heads, just the glandular
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the glandular heads of the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I really wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soon we'll have Steve, the chainsaw
guy up here for a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll laugh about this further.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to show you a close up of
how I clean the resin a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get a little closer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just discussing the quality of the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put your card through there gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it's a real nice grainy,
nice white color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you even hear it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the great sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not your regular stuff that falls
out of a tumbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's filled with low quality trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is high quality bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably 90% plus dry shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be checking it out with the macro
lens in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we photographed it with the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 plus percent heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be overlaying these shots right as
I'm speaking and you'll see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still going to do, you can also feel
that, hear that sound and feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were doing this, it's very gritty,
grainy, sand-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's just almost all heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be very gentle with this and just ever
so gently pushing the little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a little bit of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, it wouldn't take long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could work resin like this for a very
short period of time and come out with a
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% pure heads easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you had a hit, didn't you,
John?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was melty and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just potent as, racy you said?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I'm already, I already actually did
it this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because I have the first part of it,
that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you did this morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The color is lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is actually under the bottom
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I didn't do is I didn't harvest
at the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was just a different method that
we've done today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the one screen below with all
of that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've cleaned this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well this just came out superb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, literally what I just did,
the back and forth motion, the carding
[SPEAKER_01]: gently back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a colder environment, if you can,
it will push through all those other
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have hash that's only 20% heads,
you can still use this technique and get
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the point where it looks and feels
and smokes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess really what we should do is maybe
I'll have one big puff and say our
[SPEAKER_01]: adieu's.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the big benefit concert tonight
that we're going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we're headed and that's the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten to my favorite part of the
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: What part are we at John?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the, we're now testing what we
just cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to bio assay the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone likes to put their product in a
gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to put mine into my lungs,
get it into my bloodstream and then get it
[SPEAKER_01]: into my endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll let you know what I think of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we won't make much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but it was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the large hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You notice how it just hangs before it
drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I'm sure you've already seen the
pictures of this, uh, about of what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: about to hit as we just showed you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's 90 plus percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did clean it a little bit for about
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we probably got it up to 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you
[SPEAKER_00]: do without the Westin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for their cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Load one of those up for Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even exhale that whole head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: As most of you know out there that have
smoked the full melt dry sift,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really is considered the Holy grail of
hashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now not the strain Holy grail,
but the Holy grail in the sense of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems to be as you climb and you go
through this cannabis experience and you
[SPEAKER_01]: learn, you know, I started with seeds and
stems and green papers with thick glue and
[SPEAKER_01]: that turned into thinner papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually we got the stems and the
seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually I just got the bud out and then
I got all the contaminant that it was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichomes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm at a point where I just
really, really appreciate, I mean I wear
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and I eat cannabis for health,
but for smoking it, I really just smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: where the medicine is located,
which is the glandular head of the
[SPEAKER_01]: capitate stock trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people do talk about the
whole picture of the plant, which works
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot within the community where a
lot of people like just the culture part
[SPEAKER_02]: of it as working with it and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different uses for the
cannabis plant, you know, 50,000
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, thanks for coming out everyone
and watching the show and hanging out with
[SPEAKER_01]: all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great time making some hash with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you learned some tips and we're
just going to keep puffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Oh, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you a big old bubble on and may
the full melt dry sift bless your bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then daily first, sooner than later
than daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more hit for the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually then we're off to the concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers guys.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
