[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the wake and bake episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if I can turn this around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, it locks up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: I dropped my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last little bit, but it's still enough in
there that I shouldn't be just throwing it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everyone's doing well today on this
wake and bake episode 63.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see there's a good amount of people in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 40 or 50 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, that just jumped up to 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: These don't break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to spike these on tile or concrete
to break them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin Trudeau Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everyone's doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking a little bit about people
talking a little bit about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how finding a cultivar that is mold
resistant and or a cultivar that is good
[SPEAKER_01]: for the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to know what a good good
cultivar is.
[SPEAKER_01]: For their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a real simple way is for people that
can't seem to find the truth out there is
[SPEAKER_01]: to do some simple research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research where your environment is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in a dry area like in Arizona?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in a wet area like in Washington?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two areas are very different and
they're going to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things will be easier to grow
there and it's very simple powder powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew resistant cultivars generally come
from the tropics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've spent, you know, generation upon
generation growing in the tropics where
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've created resistancies to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, cultivars like Afghanis
that are in the dry arid mountain ranges
[SPEAKER_01]: that do not have have never been around
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They almost attract it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you plug it in on the West Coast
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you see the pattern of many,
many, many, many, many people getting
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going, we're still live,
aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we here?
[SPEAKER_01]: All good?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we maybe we're dead out there
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, let's do something fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give away a bottle of DC glass
cleaner really quick, really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking like my son putting an L in front
of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The video that we're going to be asking
the question for today is called,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called Puff Wednesday and then it
is called Mothership Elite 3D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exo Fab Session.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you like, I could potentially plug
that in for you guys, because it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a, a little bit of a,
all right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is the name of the video right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday Mothership Elite 3D Exo Fab
Session.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the first few minutes of the
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to know is it's actually
in the first two and a half minutes of the
[SPEAKER_01]: video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you watch the first two and a half
minutes of the video, all I want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me is what happens that's a little
out of the ordinary?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens in the first two and a half
minutes that's kind of like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: shocking?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can tell me that, remember I am
the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to hear any whining when
you've mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go watch the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am the chronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hits the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am the chronic has won a bottle of DC
glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wouldn't mind sending me a email at
bcbubbleman at iCloud.com and I will send
[SPEAKER_01]: you that bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: An unopened one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get an unopened one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right on I am the chronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well go watch the video, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, that's $100,000 pipe that he's
smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he literally hits the fucking bong
with the toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to wonder about some
people's kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just joking, he's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously, $100,000 bong and you're
not going to take better care of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit, some people have more money
than they know what to do with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even, you know, I didn't even
know he did that in that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch, I don't even react.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually watched it later and was like,
whoa, chip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take out like a $14,000 chip on the
pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: $100,000 Canadian I'll have you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's only about 70,000 US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not quite, not quite as crazy as one
might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it's time for a wake and bake
here, yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Little vacant baking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little hash stuck to the bottom of
my pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will be opened when it crosses border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine had holes poked in, safety seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay though.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to open it, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a website to get the glass cleaner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Try Googling it Norcal's nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Amazon, but try Googling dark
crystal glass and you should come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: it pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's actually do a rip here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this will go until about 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's time for a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a little wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to get ourselves inspired.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't left a film on my quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could leave a film on your quartz if
you left it there, but I just cleaned mine
[SPEAKER_01]: up with the Q-tips and it's been fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm definitely not forcing anyone to
use a DC glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just myself find that it's very
convenient and useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you that don't,
that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, I've always thought it's another
meaning of how do you smoke, but is it
[SPEAKER_01]: clear your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your secret?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just the way I am, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how I operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you give us an inspiring story about
educating people about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's a pretty incredible
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would look into Dr. William
Courtney, Dr. Bob Malameed, Dr. David
[SPEAKER_01]: Allen, and probably a few that I'm
forgetting about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very important system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like the crank of two wheels
that turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two pedals that turn are the
central nervous system and the immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get that crank going perfect,
there's homeostasis that's created and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body is communicating as your body is
unable to communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, it's communicating because
it's operating all of your biological
[SPEAKER_01]: functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's responsible for all of your
biological functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's turp up, shall we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, nice and low temp there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's always a little trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get a real nice low temper,
you can just give it another smack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, that ought to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to waste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey Allen, I'm a bubble man's younger
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I really only need to clean the
banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rig was cleaned yesterday midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you puff the kill, that shit reclaims
pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean that banger pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, today I was gonna talk a little bit
about bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna talk a little bit about some
of the tips and tricks that I have found
[SPEAKER_01]: useful over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things for sure is people that
have washed using the bubble bags water,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a water extraction process for
those of you that don't know, have often
[SPEAKER_01]: wondered why they're getting a cleaner
material out of the second batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because they have not done a
proper pre-cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using outdoor material,
if you're using material where the people
[SPEAKER_01]: have been sweeping a lot in their rooms
and don't have proper clean, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more licensed production facilities
that I go into, the more professional
[SPEAKER_01]: builds and greenhouses that I go into,
the more I cringe at the thought of black
[SPEAKER_01]: pots on a concrete basement floor with
dirt all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how I started, I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine for a personal grow,
but I don't think it's the best situation
[SPEAKER_01]: to be growing for other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are little errors that can
happen, and what happens is you get dust
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bits of dirt and dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a great way to get rid of that is
to take that material, say you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound, you're gonna run a pound at a time,
maybe in a 20 gallon kit, and you take
[SPEAKER_01]: that pound and you put it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use kind of like one of those
portable sinks that you clean dishes in
[SPEAKER_01]: when you, yeah, fans kick mad shit up,
especially if the shit's there to kick up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a portable little plastic sink that's
about this tall, and I'll put the material
[SPEAKER_01]: in it and I'll gently massage it I don't
want to knock off any glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I really want to do is I want to make
sure that I am allowing the dirt and the
[SPEAKER_01]: debris to dislodge and it will sink
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of massage it very gentle,
and this is one of those things that is
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much like sieving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked me the other day,
what's the best temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much moisture should I leave behind
before I sieve?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, that's the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therein lies the conundrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no perfect number each and every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's variables that occur and they have
got to be learned to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to learn to recognize what you're
looking at and when you have a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality resin and you don't know it,
and you press too much moisture out with
[SPEAKER_01]: the pressing screen, well, you've just
pressed that patty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're gonna have to throw it in the
freezer and you're going to be forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: microplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I microplane only when I'm forced to
microplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that microplaning shreds the heads
it opens them up, it opens them up to
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen and to light and not necessarily
the worst thing in the world, but for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my microencapsulated resin glands
to be microencapsulated, not shredded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot thanks for helping me step
up my game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, in the regards to these things
are hard to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: How gentle do you massage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some people might massage,
and then you realize you've knocked a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of resin off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, that resin will be easily
trapped, but it'll be trapped with all
[SPEAKER_01]: that dirt and debris, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: take the water from that container,
pour it through a 25 or a 45 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll catch all the heads, but you'll see
how much contaminant is in there for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the moisture content of
the patty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very tricky to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say the colder the room,
the more of a sweet spot you'll open up,
[SPEAKER_01]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in a warmer environment and you
have high quality resin, it'll be easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to fuck up and be forced to microplane
before you know it than it would be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: colder environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water content is what's going to allow
the hash to sieve perfectly through the
[SPEAKER_01]: sieve, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: That water content, you have to know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no numbers I can explain to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the numbers each and every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They change and the variables change
depending on the size of the head,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the percentage of wax
membrane versus oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside the head, all of these little
variables that take place create the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that you end up with, and it
really is a feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much like when you heard Chimera,
if you were watching Hash Church
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday, say you're like the hash
whisperer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you were just pressing that
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were listening to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were smelling it, and I'm like,
yeah, I use all my senses when I make
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I can, can you dry out a patty of
hash successfully?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ryan, no, you can't, and yes,
you can, is the quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, say, Ryan, that you are in Arizona,
and you are talking about a 25 micron
[SPEAKER_01]: patty, but you just say patty.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 micron heads are so much smaller that
they have less, picture marbles in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Large marbles in a bowl will create larger
spaces between the marbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller marbles in the bowl will create
much, much smaller spaces, so less room
[SPEAKER_01]: for water to be trapped, seemingly easier
for the patty to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher quality, larger heads, very
impossible to dry a patty like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly if you're not in Arizona,
but you're up in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often people forget to mention the
variables when they ask questions or when
[SPEAKER_01]: they answer questions or when they're
telling people and teaching people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they teach them based on the variables in
the environment that they themselves are
[SPEAKER_01]: used to, but you have to understand,
I've been doing this for almost 20 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and about five to eight years ago,
I came under the understanding that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to the world and that everyone has
different environmental variables,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I have to take that into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very, this is wherein lies the
confusion when we're trying to learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: these simple processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the real answer to all of your
questions is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get better?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I make the best hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to make some
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to stop being afraid
to fuck up and jump in with both feet,
[SPEAKER_01]: happily ready to fuck up, because in that
fucking up, you are going to learn so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more than me or anyone else could possibly
teach you, but I think it's probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: most valuable thing that I could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to anything that I said
today, and it sounds like a great quote
[SPEAKER_01]: and all, but really think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go make your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all fear them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to make their mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into a position where we're like,
we want to play it safe, but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: really start doubling down and you jump in
with both feet each and every time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mistakes are priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not costly mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are valuable lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I could say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, Drew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacy Bro in the house, Bingo Lombardi,
Sticks with Terps, Jeffro ALL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that was a pretty good little
knowledge drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it only lasted about seven
minutes, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two parts, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting your material clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The processing part is super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, putting in the ice and putting in
the material and dropping it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine and turning a dial and filtering
it through bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: A monkey could do that, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lifting up the bags and scooping it out
with a spoon, a small child could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm not condoning that small children
go and make hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get myself into any
trouble, but I'm just saying it's so easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to scoop it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The really only hard part is when you're
going to be drying it or preparing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do that correctly,
you could make all sorts of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I told people for years on
the West Coast, particularly in my area,
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you wanted to get the moisture out
in the West Coast in the winter or fall,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be a good idea to use a
desiccant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found food grade cardboard to be the
safest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't contaminate in any way,
but that's because I was sieving my
[SPEAKER_01]: powder, spreading it thin, and always when
people send me pictures of cardboard with
[SPEAKER_01]: piles of hash on it, I'm like,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to basically stretch that out,
thin it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it very, very thin so it almost
looks like nothing's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be touching itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is touching itself, it'll create
larger patties that will stick together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will pull cardboard fibers off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I photograph all my hash with a macro
photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have someone who's done it
incorrectly pull up a big patty of hash
[SPEAKER_01]: with cardboard fibers on it and tell me
that I'm an idiot because I'm using a
[SPEAKER_01]: desiccant that allows fibers to be pulled
into the final product, I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, you are doing it incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow the rule, not the rules,
but the simple directions, instructions if
[SPEAKER_01]: you will, you will do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will come out the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't change a bunch of things and
then expect it to come out the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing about the parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I now use pizza boxes for years now where
I close it over the parchment paper that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very nice in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cardboard surrounding it still manages
to pull out the moisture, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: some hashes that really do require the
direct surface area of the desiccant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parchment, of course, is not a
desiccant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not really absorb too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will for a little bit, but it doesn't
disperse it and dry out the same way that
[SPEAKER_01]: cardboard does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going on a hash blank sounds great,
but it's not how the emerald turned out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sorry about going on a musical guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know what, pharmacy,
I can't even remember if I said anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little, you know, someone said
something earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had said, oh, high times,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I won't
[SPEAKER_01]: go on in a rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in my head, I said thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, yeah, pharmacy was ranting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say get in touch with him if you
want to offer help and make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's hard to rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it got away from him last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good dude, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He means well, and he's really like he's
good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just I'm sure that he's just
trying to make it the best event that he
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime you make something like that,
I'm sure there's going to be impossible
[SPEAKER_01]: logistics to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I ever been to a volcano?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to volcanoes before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess one was in Panahashel in
Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's surrounded by volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I can't remember Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like two or three of them
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, Indra and Todd constantly were
getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel that when Indra originally came
on, he spoke a lot more about just his
[SPEAKER_01]: stories and cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it's turned into a business for
him, he's really just talks about the
[SPEAKER_01]: business end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always about his product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always about something that he's
doing that's going to be a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really, really, really careful to
not try and over promote any of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't really promote bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't hear me promoting my products on
Hash Church because Hash Church has it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a little bit bigger than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would, you know, it's bigger than
me for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be the most like I don't want
it to be promotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want us to promote what we
believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that he believes in his
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I believe in mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to we really have to maintain
an integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Todd had brought on Tim as a guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought out of respect,
Todd is really much more than someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to come on and promote the products
that he's selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's more along the lines of wanting
church to be the best that it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to bring great people and
trying to create great dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's really, really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked Indras got all his businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's like I'm I'm not upset
with Indra.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like imagine that Hash Church is
bigger than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Todd may come off as a dick,
but he's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just he's just a unique person that
has a really unique foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this that came out of almost dying
as a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his cannabis and he's gone to prison
for for, you know, five years of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He served in a penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's OK if you have your opinion about
him for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just be careful knowing that he is
really one of my close friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I don't you know, I don't I
mean, you know, Sam's salmon injury used
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't I hate the idea of people like
trying to tell people who they should
[SPEAKER_01]: thank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was one of the things that
didn't sit well with me when people would
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, Rick, Simpson turned me on to
this and it saved my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Indra would say, well,
you need to thank me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed him how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, no, you didn't show him
how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's he's making something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be back on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not kicked off by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to let people know every once
in a while that no one owns a position on
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Church is ever changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The panel changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different people come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone is not on, it doesn't mean
necessarily that they're in the outs with
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still support Indra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad his businesses are doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want people to go and check out his
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did ask him if he wouldn't,
you know, stay in the chat or in coming
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, he asked, are you mad at me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I don't just want you to
come in and turn it into a commercial for
[SPEAKER_01]: your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that I listen, I watched
him in the chat room the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty much a commercial for
his product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I've created the place for him to
come and sell his product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the chat, I would love the chat
to be about what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love the chat to not be people who
want to come in and promote themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope I didn't offend anyone by saying
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having Indra come on Hash Church has
been a huge blessing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just I just think that people have
to stop overly adverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even Tony, who's like constantly
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see how much he dials back and
doesn't self promote, even though it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard for him to talk about Prana or the
Bubble Man brand or Blue River,
[SPEAKER_01]: because those are the things that he's
doing constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's innovating and he loves to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I don't want you guys to think that
one day Hash Church has turned into some
[SPEAKER_01]: sellout promotional thing where everyone's
just there, you know, from self promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's bigger than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you guys like it because
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if we change that,
it's a tough position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacy, bro, you know, it's a tough
position for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what, though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett Maverick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say this about Brett Maverick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking like Brett Maverick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he means well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he's a bad person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about him,
but I kind of get a kick out of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few things that he said have have
really made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I there's a good reason why that guy
has a following.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any time anyone has a following,
there's going to be a small group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who just hate the guy and say
negative, mean, nasty things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really see what the purpose
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't really see what the
purpose is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he is what he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get him on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chas the Banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett brought us the Banger Chasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you know, trying to do that,
trying to do that, mama, trying to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just trying to, will you please
explain the process of spreading the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: thin and what you use to do so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Kiki Meow, it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a first of all, when I say get a
piece of cardboard, I it's not a small
[SPEAKER_01]: piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be like an extra large pizza box
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you had a very small amount,
you might be able to do all the bags on
[SPEAKER_01]: there and just do a with a marker as you
how it is as simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, imagine you have a cheese grater or
not a cheese grater, a parmesan grater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because that falls a little closer
to what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine I have it up here and I'm doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't move the grater, it all falls
in a pile on top of my pasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I move it around the pasta,
I can put a thin layer as thin as I want
[SPEAKER_01]: or as thick as I want evenly spread over
the surface area of what I want covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I have videos where I'm doing this
and you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to see in person, but we're
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not answer the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gently will push.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm using a cold spoon and I'm using
small amounts of bubble in a colder
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm in a warmer environment,
I'll use even smaller amounts of bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping the other ones cold for to just
keep that structure of how it wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: fluff and fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you allow it to self press and gravity
to hold upon it and more moisture to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove, you'll be forced to freeze it in
microplane, which is going to bust up all
[SPEAKER_01]: the heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spreading it thin is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective, you just grate,
not grate, sorry, push with the spoon
[SPEAKER_01]: gently through the sieve and it'll fall
like little droplets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now just spread it thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing, no tool you can use
because it's wet bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try to use anything to move that
stuff around now that it's fallen,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to fall properly and that's how it
has to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody understands that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say, big squirrel nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly, big squirrel nuts
basically nailed it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm not opposed to me or my friends
selling a product that people are stoked
[SPEAKER_01]: about having.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why I talk about the cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why I talk about little things that I
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like a ton of things in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fairly, most of the things in the
industry I'm kind of like, ugh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something I will have a use
for, but when I find something I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: use for, I'm extremely excited to show it
to people and I don't get paid by these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give me shares in their
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sometimes they'll give me products
and now I'm just giving all those away
[SPEAKER_01]: too, so I'll keep it like they don't give
me anything, although friends still do
[SPEAKER_01]: give me little gifts that I appreciate and
am very thankful for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aloha Rich Griggs from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're having a beautiful,
wonderful day in paradise, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit, people go there to travel
from across the world just to visit for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week and you get to live there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, boom, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's with these thermal bangers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a banger within a banger,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the way, you'll see all sorts of
different innovations with the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we find out the importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, terpenes are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally learned so much about that that
now that we understand how important they
[SPEAKER_01]: are and what they're doing to the
cannabinoids, that obviously how they are
[SPEAKER_01]: inhaled, how they are evaporated,
what surface area and what temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: they are evaporated at will have the facts
on how you feel, like how they feel in
[SPEAKER_01]: your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit a low temp banger, it's tasty,
it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not rock you the same as a much
hotter rip and also off of different
[SPEAKER_01]: surface areas, there are subtle
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that there's a quality of
preservation that occur in surfaces that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow heat to dissipate evenly,
if you will, and hold heat in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to dissipate evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titanium holds it for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bueno.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit it if I have to, but yes,
he means a higher, well, no, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no, no, no, no, he's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just meaning that of the glandular
tract, the trichome heads, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a high percentage of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's higher percentages of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say Google would definitely
be your friend there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a Wikipedia on each one would
define to you exactly what terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids, what class of isoprenes those
are, and then you could go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have less experience with flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't researched it as much,
I'm much like Skunkman Sam, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: are non-active when smoked or inhaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never really been a reason to try
and find out what was going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, where's the troll?
[SPEAKER_01]: Troll, troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me where the troll is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love getting rid of trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get rid of Miranda.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Miranda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you, Miranda?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even see Miranda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right, she wants to have sex with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, we're all good here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just puffing bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need for...
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes, the Troll Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it with my three-year-old son.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his name there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guillermo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guillermo del Toro?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Troll Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavy duty, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's have one more rip and
we're gonna say goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more little dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's puff another, shall we, Ayko?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I was in the middle of having sex
with Miranda and we messed it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people must be bored out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you're just looking for things,
though, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of remember back in the day when I
was on the computer just Skyping
[SPEAKER_01]: strangers, like, hey, I was so excited to
get Skype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just go through the Skype
directory and I would just hit people up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some pretty incredible
conversation and then it turned into every
[SPEAKER_01]: single time someone hit me up,
it was ASL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just turned it off and stopped with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must have been like 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know, but pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: ASL, I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a full cock blocker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because I've been with my wife for 29
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we shall, puff one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the gas pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age, sex, language?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or location, yeah, location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age, sex, location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically what trolls that are
trolling for, like, desperate people,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually dudes, fishing at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just avoided it at all cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never looked on the internet for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more interested in finding
educational information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis, wow, look at all the
cannabis information we put on the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer over the course of the last 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been massively affecting the
populace.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are learning about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, don't get me wrong, a ton of
people learn about it from Sanjay Gupta
[SPEAKER_01]: and other very, very mainstream,
straight people that mention it just in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little blurb or maybe even do a whole show
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those people then go onto the internet
and they start doing research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's where our information comes in
handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, Canabra, why were you expecting
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be on the wrong chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the question is, quaves are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, quave bangers are like le top.
[SPEAKER_01]: DC makes some pretty damn decent bangers
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, these are from Method Sevens,
the glasses that I wear all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, don't grow blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll hit these guys up and see if
they want to give away a few shirts or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a pair of Method Sevens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're really generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the quaves are nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are the DCs, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm using one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know, but you know what,
they might like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, it might be nice for
Method Seven to get the exposure as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of like thinking, they've been
so generous to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like I'm going out of my way
as much as maybe giving them an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity where if they want to donate
some shirts or whatever, we would gladly
[SPEAKER_01]: give them away on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, plenty of people watch the CNN.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how a lot of people got
mainstreamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information on cannabis was when Sanjay
Gupta admitted that he was wrong and
[SPEAKER_01]: apologized and then went on this whole,
that was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure how that came to be, but very,
very cool that it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, yeah, I was smoking some Justin
Trudeau Kush from the Glacial Melts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good old Glacial Melts, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was puffing a little of the,
of the Bubble Hash Congo, apologies for my
[SPEAKER_01]: nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went camping and after two, three
showers, they're still dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all like dirty nail guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, when, sweet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost ready for another puff,
but I think I'm going to call it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 35 minuteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a lot of talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how much oil I took.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't weigh my oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a bunch, a lot, enough to get
everyone high like 50 times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't want to, all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Kelo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everyone has gotten their packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I'm going to be giving away
the next batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully if you send me your email,
your bottle will go out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm getting backed up, I feel bad,
but one guy wrote me and said he didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want the gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just wanted me to answer all his
questions and he never gave me an address,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it still feels like I'm one short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully not, but I'm going to mail them
all out today and we'll see if you're one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those people that won and I didn't send
you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely don't feel bad to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be the kind of guy that
says, I'm going to give you something and
[SPEAKER_01]: then totally space on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have a great day everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: May the full melt bless your bowl sooner
than later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
