[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna lie, I finally went out and
got a new camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kinda see the box over my shoulder
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we are starting with this
video with the new 4K camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what kind of quality we can
share here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so here you can see the quality
difference in the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a total idiot, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for recording this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I had it set on the
lowest setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty ridiculous optical zoom on this
thing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see, I'm zooming in several
kilometers away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hand-holding this so there's no tripod
or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the little bit of shake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for that kind of a zoom and to see
that clear, I was quite impressed with the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys should expect better things to
come from the new 4K camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: New 4K camera on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Panasonic 991 XCW or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little 4K unit, prosumer model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too expensive, not too inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you guys are gonna be enjoying
the quality on this and it's got some
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool options and new things with
picture in picture and being able to use
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple smartphones to record and put
that inside the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll probably end up doing that
eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for today, just a quick little video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Went and saw the guys at Sunrise Wellness
here in Vancouver the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dom, great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a nice little session with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really liked his education that he was
laying out to the customers that were
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a shop that is carrying a
higher quality that you see, generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gifted me a small little bud here
which is the Gorilla Glue Number 4,
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed with the 09 Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little package that it came in as
well that was open and not gonna squish
[SPEAKER_02]: the bud type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already vaped a little bit of the bud
and I've squished just a tiny little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nice size bud that he gave me,
so too bright there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's maybe a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still getting used to this bright,
bright light off the top of the camera
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you can't really see it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, a nice little bud by AnyOne
Standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the Sasquatch press behind me all laid
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All lit up and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at about 238 degrees right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna grab my parchment real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a piece of parchment all pre-ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gotta give it a fold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I generally break up the bud and
make it kinda long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty decent quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let's crack this open a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not raising it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably gonna give it the pre-squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that lever's closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over here to the air compressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring her down slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now she's squishing, I can hear her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, squishing nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna open it up and check out what
we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let's get this squishing on so
we can show you what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so this is what we got out of the
squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the first squish.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty left, so I'll fold it all
up into a small ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there's a tiny little dab of
what I collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of little pieces in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One little particulate I see in the bottom
right there as I turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice quality looking, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already had a dab, so I know it's
tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla glue number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's press it again and see what we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I've broken the piece up and
I'm gonna squish it in this little sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: pancake stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pancake stack tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't really see it, but the stack is in
there, I assure you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There she goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get this happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for a squish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Got much more efficient on that squish and
this thing really laid out the juice like
[SPEAKER_02]: what I knew it was willing to lay out,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there is why you wanna do a couple
of squishes just in case you're not super
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to It's worth doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's collect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just get rid of a couple of
little little bits of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's collect this up and see how
well she's collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry you guys can't see that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's... And we'll get the second
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so you can see this is real
sappy, sticky stuff, almost shattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite sappy once heated up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always excited to see what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little dab right there, not too
shabby at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so yeah, nice little dab that
came out of that right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the first dab right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we wanna get fancy and we wanna
show you both dabs simultaneously,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha, camera in camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: New camera, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be playing around with all
sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you guys enjoyed the short video and
yeah, maybe I'll finish it off with a bong
[SPEAKER_02]: rip, shall I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there's the second press right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's our first press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of contaminant in there,
but that will sit on my nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let us do a dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one should we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we hit a little mixture of both?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's our little cake, almost
looking like there's still a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: goods left in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I finally managed to get
myself that little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dipped in, I will have you know,
some Cherry AK-47 Blue River Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you about these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness, these are some special,
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making the rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first I wasn't sure if I had dipped it
and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm not sure if I've dipped
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you have not dipped it when
you're not sure that you've dipped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you have, trust me,
you're going to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: As this right now is reeking up the entire
area around my face right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my torch all heated up, the mothership
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch here, did it all off camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it all heated up, the bucket set,
and got my carb cap dab in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at about the 48 second mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were hitting the quartz,
we'd be probably hitting it right about
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it is the ceramic from Hive,
the brothership actually, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: wait a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually go a minute and a half to two
minutes on the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably going to trade my clear one in
soon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mothership bucket, little honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold dial, get that traded in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe get myself a colored one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one that you'll see me
using I think here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're at about a minute and 30
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're good to go now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lovely flavor on those terpenes,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a pretty damn sweet temperature on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not super, super low temp, but definitely
puddling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to catch it at the closest level of
puddling that I can without wasting too
[SPEAKER_02]: much of my rip and knowing that I'm still
getting a really full flavored,
[SPEAKER_02]: full bodied hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for watching that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a little bit of this rosin left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check out Sunrise Wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping on doing a video with those
guys where I go down there, pick out a few
[SPEAKER_02]: different flavors of nuggets, maybe a
couple of hashes, and then go home and
[SPEAKER_02]: puff them and give you guys a little
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really happy with the quality that
they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not many dispensaries that
I'll avidly jump in behind and say you
[SPEAKER_02]: should go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're all great for access,
but for me, because of the way I use
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is basically for the highest
quality that I can find, I'm really OCD
[SPEAKER_02]: about the level of care that was taken to
grow it and whether it was grown
[SPEAKER_02]: organically and whether it was grown... If
they've been spraying it in any way,
[SPEAKER_02]: shape, or form as a processor,
not even as an end user, I immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: have a problem with it because I
concentrate those terrible things with my
[SPEAKER_02]: good things that I'm extracting,
so that doesn't work too well either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm just rambling now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a quick little video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sasquatch, shout out to those guys,
Soil Grown Sal, and hopefully the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of the videos just gets better and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also changed the lights in my office.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put three new beautiful lights in and
you can see this really bright kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: light that surrounds me now, as opposed to
that really terrible yellow light that we
[SPEAKER_02]: started with at the start of the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we'll see you next time on Go
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you guys keep pressing those buttons,
and may the full mouth bless your bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
