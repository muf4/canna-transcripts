obviously Nothing less than epic glass
[SPEAKER_03]: some more glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, dude Welcome welcome so a
few of these I recognize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the Marcel spirit bubbler
from smoke volume 2 that we had it on a
[SPEAKER_02]: boat last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one doesn't make it out too often
This is a roller coaster on Instagram or
[SPEAKER_02]: ghost glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an electraform sculpted the face
doesn't really It doesn't really like
[SPEAKER_02]: represent anything Necessarily,
but it does look like like I've been told
[SPEAKER_02]: at least the cyborg guys from Star Trek or
the Star Trek show But it's a true
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful piece for sculpting I mean and
more than just electric forms like
[SPEAKER_03]: literally like Metallic parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's well there's he has little
diodes like this is a like AC adapter That
[SPEAKER_02]: he's cut off and electroformed right into
the to the borough This is like like you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see how the bolt is screwed on and
then the nut is So it looks like it had a
[SPEAKER_02]: pin through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then each each one like I mean,
they're different like plumbing pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me feel like it was wet and dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is not either No, yeah,
it's just the like the patina on the other
party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's got like some nice green
patina Well, we definitely got to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out a bowl on that to take a big ripoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I have an 18 bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have to throw a screen on it
and and have a pop But for now we can we
[SPEAKER_03]: can start with this little amazing
mothership dosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah This is a oji moss, which is an
extinct color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean there's tubing around of it
Green the Sun the green you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does to look at it close up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks surreal Yeah, it's got a really
nice full globe Opal right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a white fire one with some
Crushed opal with rainbow double-layer
[SPEAKER_02]: tubing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's beautiful, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't John's such a I mean, you know,
like he is a young artist in the grand
[SPEAKER_02]: scheme of things but man is he's just
coming along So but I love hitting his
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces and looking at his art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm stoked for that I've got this
beautiful sweet skunk dry sift that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been ripping like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's No, wait in the pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, wait You were talking about the CBD
Renee was no, I don't have much of the CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: Renee But I take a little tiny little bit
take a little tiny guy and I'll give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice little I'll give you a nice rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say it's always nice coming back
on your show some of the more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_03]: times Wait until you get a load of that
taste that is a big ripper Big ol ripper
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is the Renee CBD from Matt the
house of the great gardener And I'll tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you when he comes up from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's gonna talk about the candy flavor
that's leftover he's gonna talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: intensity of the Fruity dash candy of the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so intense that when you're finally
done with it exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a oh my gosh Oh my gosh,
like it's just it's it's all the
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderfulness of Renee and then leaving
behind a bit of the funk Some of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: strange undertones that come from the
strain It's left all that behind and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the can of tonic has inspired more of this
fruity sweet sort of big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like candy Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like those little dip sticks that you
would dip into the sugar That is
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, it's it's it's got a lot of
floral tones to it like and really really
[SPEAKER_02]: really fruity Wow Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good job, which will be seeing you
in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure The over-the-under all right,
so I'm excited now actually to hit this
[SPEAKER_03]: The quartz bowl that I've ever had I think
this is called direct injection this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular ball I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: really looking forward to see all the
matte stuff over in the Holland this year
[SPEAKER_02]: kicking some ass for the Canadian team
Well, he sure got great stuff Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's tasty like come on really tasty you
finally exhale that last little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke One second delay and then the flavor
literally explodes in the back of my
[SPEAKER_03]: throat all the way up and eventually I
start licking my lips and I can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: taste it on there as well that is Really
strong it is and the high CBD like you can
[SPEAKER_02]: feel it like I have I have Osteoarthritis
in my shoulder and so I can really feel it
[SPEAKER_02]: when when there's a really good body
effect When when the the pain management
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as the physical pain management is
in effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always like that, you know,
I always felt Renee was very body oriented
[SPEAKER_03]: and very strong pain relief and sort of
you know, however, he worked that cross it
[SPEAKER_03]: worked out great for him and Yeah,
that's pretty exciting So let's find a
[SPEAKER_03]: bowl for this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna find a bowl for that I want you
to take a rip out of this and tell them
[SPEAKER_03]: what you think of the sweet skunk Okay,
if I must I will be back in a flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live sir All right, so let's try some
of the sweet skunk also, I believe by Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Sweet skunks always been one of my
favorite strains The spiciness and the
[SPEAKER_02]: earthiness Literally like I don't
personally know the heritage of the strain
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where the strain originates
from but it always reminds me of being
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in like the Polynesians or like
Tropical yet Humid with a lot of good
[SPEAKER_02]: spicy food around it's just so delicious
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you there are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um slinger Slinger.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right has even though there's a bit of
an angle to it Well, you know what I do
[SPEAKER_03]: with this particular bowl how I really
like this bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, you take the pipe off And all of
these pieces you guys I'll have with me in
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland this year at the county So,
you know, it's almost perfect just like
[SPEAKER_03]: that I hit it kind of like this Beautiful
you want to hit it like that you keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: like it really however you want I've
always said it sort of sideways like this
[SPEAKER_02]: totally Let me know like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the perfect time, you know,
I do got to do I could just start quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: run and get some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes Or you know what screens fitted wells
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh look at this he ran and got some water
So yeah, this is an old slinger bowl from
[SPEAKER_03]: probably around 2000 Maybe 2001 this was
at a time when I was trying to explain to
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruhr That the open bowl wasn't really the
concept that they should be looking at for
[SPEAKER_03]: the concentrate user the hash smoker We're
more into these pushed bowls with either a
[SPEAKER_03]: single hole or multi hole so you can use
the herb iron or a product like that But
[SPEAKER_03]: this was sort of slingers response and I
think it was honestly one of his first
[SPEAKER_03]: like, okay Well, let's let's see what we
got See Did you try this I did yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lovely I gave a nice little review
for the folks at home Well, let us know
[SPEAKER_03]: what you feel off of a flame hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm gonna actually have to go get
Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for professionalism?
[SPEAKER_02]: Without disturbing the toke using the
dabber to remove a hair did it somehow go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the screen almost look like a fiber
fiber hair We're you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals here folks There is one
actual thing that I should mention that
[SPEAKER_02]: this marble here, which I'm sure Mark will
be taking some photographs of is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the few pieces that's not actually done by
ghost on the piece it's a freak brain
[SPEAKER_02]: marble and the fume tech in these brain
marbles is Really second to none.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a really really really cool
design.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really really Cool feature the
freak was doing doesn't haven't seen a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of them recently but It's you know,
one of the it's it really helps make the
[SPEAKER_02]: piece in all honesty this this I was just
talking to the Screen about this brain
[SPEAKER_02]: marble by freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one of the top house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that just awesome?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Went and your wife gave me a beeline
hemplight I was like so it's got the
[SPEAKER_03]: beeline on there through the tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I don't know who makes these but I
picked him up Can't remember where I
[SPEAKER_02]: picked him up, but I just threw much the
beeline that I got from you on it's
[SPEAKER_02]: totally fat It's a pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll enjoy the sweet skunk with the
flame rip Good flame work good flame work
[SPEAKER_03]: Beeline is definitely the product of an
experienced user you suck too hard You
[SPEAKER_03]: suck the beeline out and you get the smoke
from the beeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing you want to contaminate your
bowl with If you don't suck hard enough
[SPEAKER_03]: the flame doesn't grow properly and it
ends up going out It's really quite a
[SPEAKER_03]: tricky sort of thing to just simply write
a bowl and then each bowl is different how
[SPEAKER_02]: hard it pulls Depending on the pipe it's
on totally how much the indent goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I were to compare the The flame took to
do the low temp dab You know more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spiciness comes out in the flame toke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is a lot more of the like Earthy
tones come out in the low temp dab,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's funny because like sweet skunk is
such an amazing Strain just no matter like
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you're smoking the flowers whether
you're consuming the concentrates no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter what it is It's just truly one of
those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a pipe that you could would
almost like Not many people could hold
[SPEAKER_03]: this pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's on the sense that yeah,
it's very awkward You wouldn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: grab it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could break a piece off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice big crazy tube, that's a
Halloween piece right there, dude Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I bring a few of these pieces to
haul in because as I'm doing an art
[SPEAKER_02]: display With the Dom Pren gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool And so I thought that I'd
bring up some pieces that that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't as publicly appreciated but Pieces
that I personally thought just have really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool artistic values to them and different
texts that were Utilized and used you know
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of these there's not a lot
of people that are doing like
[SPEAKER_02]: Electraforming as much as was like three
four years ago, you know and ghost ghost
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon Martin like those guys they really
do exceptionally cool Work I mean like
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so I've seen so many pieces
where the electroforming almost ruins the
[SPEAKER_02]: piece, you know, like I love the borrow I
love that like I love all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: texts and stuff like that but it's it's
almost like a gaudy expenditure like you
[SPEAKER_02]: know when you're hanging out in New York
and you see some like First lady walking
[SPEAKER_02]: down the street and she's just way
overdone sort of how I feel about some
[SPEAKER_02]: electroformed borrow pieces and I think
that like the subtleties and the styles
[SPEAKER_02]: and Times in which it's applied
particularly in ghost and Brandon Martin
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was saying I really think that
their texts are awesome So I thought maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'd bring them out and some of
the guys that are gonna be hanging with us
[SPEAKER_02]: in Holland We'll be able to experience
this All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's quite an interesting piece
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it with the slayer bowl on there
Yeah, you know doesn't the color scheme
[SPEAKER_02]: actually quite match because even the
yellowing and the patina in under here and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff totally Oh, yeah, geez I had the
method seven glasses on and I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: realize the color difference was
substantial these things really seriously
[SPEAKER_03]: cut I'm just too much squinting otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks guys for method seven and damn
before I forget RKM seeds, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: thank these guys from Spain sent out the
care package and Oh Goodies, let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a pack of the negra 44 So I'm
guessing there's two packs of each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's find the other negra.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the negra 44
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that one in the icers the one I
heard about the most which is right here
[SPEAKER_03]: icer a couple of packs of the icer and
Last but not least two packs of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Portela.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool, brother Looks like they're
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a read at the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: These aren't these are male and female but
look all the rest of these are feminine I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to thank you guys for sending out
those beans that super kind I'll make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that all my friends get access to the
Results that come from the seeds the top
[SPEAKER_03]: picked phenos if you have any hints for us
Let us know love to know what the what I
[SPEAKER_03]: should be looking for in any of these
packs And thank you for the kindness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be reciprocated throughout the
medical community here in Canada So that's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a really nice care package
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very nice care package and we
definitely appreciate it I've seen nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: but good good stuff come from these guys
their seed company goes back to the 90s
[SPEAKER_03]: 1998 New kid on the block I was reading
the back of one I don't I'm not the best
[SPEAKER_02]: on Spanish but you but like what I got out
of it is that they're It's a haze dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa grown in the Blue Mountains of
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point
[SPEAKER_03]: So a male Jamaican nice Sumo Monte don't
say iran resin also mucho like lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: dense resin production Hasido presever de
dentro de las selecciones lambs bread
[SPEAKER_03]: Chosen from the selection of lambs bread
He's so cool TVA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're more lame up profund of the
religion the mountain blue So yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: like they're picking from lambs bread
phenos to pick this male and that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: they used to make their icer So very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just made me excited I I'm always
happy to throw some more genetics in the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden, especially if they have Jamaican
lineage I absolutely Love resin grown
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly in Jamaica, but I also love
Jamaican strains that have been shared Out
[SPEAKER_03]: of Jamaica that we can now grow,
you know here in our own country So I have
[SPEAKER_03]: one right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing with the Congo always nice
to have a couple of those out on the deck
[SPEAKER_03]: and Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're just waiting on flav to get
back with the Marcel Phoenix He's just
[SPEAKER_03]: putting a whack of water in it and we're
gonna load it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So That up with this particular batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two batches of sweet skunk first
pass I like to call it to be confused with
[SPEAKER_03]: first bounce and First pass time All
right, so yeah, you have shown back up
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Marcel full water and I've pulled
aside the two first passes that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioning the first pass being what I
would call the first quality of Dry sift
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm able to make this is the pure of
the pure and it's a nice, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful Pure unadulterated heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is the best thing to
fucking be Yeah, do you have a preference
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'd like to know honestly pick it
just whichever whichever is clever I have
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit of a I can't stick a dirty dabber
into clean dry sift I always just give it
[SPEAKER_03]: a swipe on the D nail and then clean it
that way With my fingers and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: rubbing you're actually getting that
medicine into your skin still affecting
[SPEAKER_03]: your endocannabinoid system Yeah,
it's the same way a rick simpson oil would
[SPEAKER_03]: mmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice big fresh heavy hit Like look at this
Yeah, look at the crystal on that nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: like killing unicorns and smoking diamonds
Unicorn tears Tiny little bit of unicorn
[SPEAKER_03]: tears tried to escape.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you will die What a beautiful
thing a dry sip that melts on that level
[SPEAKER_03]: just turning to nothing Zero ash just a
nice light ash
[SPEAKER_02]: Super tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm up next.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually want to move that guy Yeah,
I'll give this one the center stage that
[SPEAKER_02]: she so deserves Yes This piece it's it's
I've actually found it quite amusing how
[SPEAKER_02]: often it comes back into the rotation
these days Yeah Cuz it was one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces that when I acquired it It goes a
piece that I always wanted it since I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the release of smoke volume 2 Never
thought I would So I kind of never thought
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'd bring it out I never thought that
it would be a piece that I puff on
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly, you know, I thought maybe the
octopus Would have some fragility to it
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the way Marcel does his
pieces the way they're tacked together
[SPEAKER_03]: right in here I have to say it's
reminiscent of my old Marcel pieces and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super comfortable around This piece I
don't mind, you know going boating with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind carrying it or walking with
it It's it's my Marcel pieces I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: take everywhere and not even with any
pelican case or anything like for years I
[SPEAKER_03]: had that thing in like a box with peanuts
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it on the front seat Like yeah,
I'm gonna take this down to like
[SPEAKER_03]: grassroots on commercial drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna pop it for a bunch of hours
That's how we did it and it worked out
[SPEAKER_03]: rather well All right, mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is such a great piece Really put your
back into picking this beast up with one
[SPEAKER_03]: hand I Want a bigger flame, yeah big tube
like this build up your flame boys big
[SPEAKER_03]: bowl of hash like that
[SPEAKER_03]: Well That's old school right there Like
real old school, yeah 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean the the reddit chat like the
The reddit chill line work, which has
[SPEAKER_02]: always been some of my favorite the line
work is ridiculous But with the air
[SPEAKER_02]: trapped bubbles, it becomes like absurd
Yeah, and how perfect though the trapping
[SPEAKER_02]: is on this one Absolutely like and to have
this have this much like imagine how much
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking pain was used You know to make
this piece and to have the trapping to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that octopus on oh, yeah,
I know and all that diaper It's really
[SPEAKER_03]: great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it all so How wonderful is
