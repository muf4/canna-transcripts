Vexpa, Cannabis Indoor, Cannabier.

[SPEAKER_01]: So how's the show going?
[SPEAKER_01]: As always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, every time I look at you,
you're surrounded by 50 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the smallest crowd you've had
around you and it's your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a small morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of grateful but I'm sure it's
going to be rip boring this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday was off the hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a sea of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere you looked around here,
every booth was just stacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nutrients are crushing it?

thirds.
