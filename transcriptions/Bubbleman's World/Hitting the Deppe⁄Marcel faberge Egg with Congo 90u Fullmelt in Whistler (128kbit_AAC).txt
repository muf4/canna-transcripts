[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, what up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man here in Whistler, British
Columbia, and I thought what a great
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flav and Aaron just buggered off to go get
some samurai sushi, and I've got the fab
[SPEAKER_00]: egg, the Marcel Depi air-trapped radicello
fab egg with the drop down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this drop down was blown by someone
completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot remember who, but when I do,
I will mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a nice rip of the Congo here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna take that Congo and drop it in
the D now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely spectacular on the mothership
rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Flav for both the Congo bubble
that you've supplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful Congo bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the epic glass that you
always seem to have, my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep watching Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be puffing a ton more fat
glass up here in Whistler, and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing a bunch of fun adventures,
so keep watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
