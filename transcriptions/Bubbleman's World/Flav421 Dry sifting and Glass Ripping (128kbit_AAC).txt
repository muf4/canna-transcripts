[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Bowman's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are again, deja vu, except John's
gone, and Flav's in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been like a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's good to see you back here from
Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't seen you since before we
left for Barcelona, so... Oh, I had the
[SPEAKER_05]: vapor line last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this what we were hitting, too?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the mini one, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, so we were hitting this little
mini guy here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you brought the larger of the two
that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the medium, Joe Peters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banjo Honey Queen Goddess with the
recycling back.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the recycling back, and with the Dosa
Mothership Honey Bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, that's a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you say all that in one quick...
In one stumbling sentence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, just... So yeah, these are
unbelievable pieces for those of you that
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't seen them before.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely some next-level shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the... Just the quality of the hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the digits, the fingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the glasswork, the bees, the
thickness, the amber.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all really quite incredible,
and it always never ceases to amaze me.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the two real gods.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Banjo for his figures and his
sculpting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's just so awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, that is damn near.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfection on us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, enough talk about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk soon about what Flav
is here for, but in the meantime,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to rip up a bowl of some of this
dry sift that's in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little Afghani from the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't that look just like cream?
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, actually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a triple-triple of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should have a triple-triple of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get you to heat me up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Shane, we'll get it away from the
screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I doubt your heating abilities
whatsoever, but wow, wouldn't that make
[SPEAKER_05]: for a great video?
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to dry sift, and the screens have a
giant hole in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that... That patties well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pattied out very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full melt from the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make some full melt
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav brought a couple hundred grams of the
rennet, a real old-time favorite strain of
[SPEAKER_05]: mine that is just now reeking up my entire
house in the most beautiful of ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no complaints on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Closer up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an eye-closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: What an incredible hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's always a pleasure hanging out
with you, Flav, because obviously I've
[SPEAKER_05]: always enjoyed glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glass art and the heady glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have become much more obsessed with
the resin and with the quality of the
[SPEAKER_05]: resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I'm quite happy with my
production glass, my little Hitman baby
[SPEAKER_05]: cakes, and my mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that those are low-quality production
pieces, but it's so nice to hit a piece of
[SPEAKER_05]: this caliber with hash of this caliber.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really... It is a treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's sort of a symbiotic relationship
with the concentrates and the heady glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both meet each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sure do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are... You should get yourself a hit
of that Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, this... I'm discussing what's
next up to bat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav has not yet seen the little dry sift
trick that actually most of you haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: even seen, because the video that John and
I filmed yesterday is still up uploading
[SPEAKER_05]: onto YouTube right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here I am about to film it again,
and we're going to show Flav this cool
[SPEAKER_05]: little trick.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is once again from a Facebook post by
a guy by the name of Dry Sift Wizard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too many shout-outs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give him the fact that he told me
this technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, he's a fairly negative
guy, and I hope that he can potentially be
[SPEAKER_05]: more positive on the onset of all things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if not, it is a cool idea,
and we're going to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to share it with you here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one-hander.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming for the little guy, eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With dome or without?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, with dome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be pretty hard to hit that
without.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to have this... There's such a
small amount of water, and this hash is so
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have almost no filtration.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we've got the four screens here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the two that I've been using for
years, the 150 micron and the 70 micron,
[SPEAKER_05]: which are known as 100 LPI and 200 LPI.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've got the new screens,
the ones that you've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is the first one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a 60 LPI and a 90 LPI.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these sizes are larger than what we
used to.
[SPEAKER_05]: This top screen is a 250, and the bottom
screen is a 180.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically... The lower the LPI,
the higher the youth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, they meet in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get to around 120 lines per inch,
it's close to 120.
[SPEAKER_05]: They meet, and then they cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's drop some Rene buds on
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, at first we're going to be
real gentle.
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't be crushing these ones up on this
screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of a gentle process where we
literally just gently bounce and try to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep all the herb on the inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it wants to bounce around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely easier when you're using
powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are full bone dry nuggets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the purpose of this process is
because the holes are so big, tons falls
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the second screen, the majority of the
contaminant somehow gets caught up in the
[SPEAKER_05]: second screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either by piercing it or literally just
laying flat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like the balls falling this short
little distance seem to make it through,
[SPEAKER_05]: whereas not a lot else does.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we'll see what Rene is saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here, we'll try it with the buds,
and if we see a nice return, we'll do it a
[SPEAKER_05]: few more times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really not that much of a process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that literally, what I did just
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should be enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see all the contaminant
just sitting on top there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little rip and guaranteed it'll be pure
heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, let's try it again and we'll
break the herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what we can find.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to grind the herb up the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grinder is ideal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have ground about half of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half of it's still in bud and the other
half we've ground up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give it a little,
oh God, does it smell great?
[SPEAKER_05]: A little shot of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any gloves, so going bare
hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I was just noticing to
Flav was that the bud, although it felt
[SPEAKER_05]: so, so dry when we first touched it and it
breaks up quite nice, there's still
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture inside the nuggets when you break
them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with a strain like Renee, which is no
slouch for terpenes, it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: losing any extra terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could let this literally sit out like
this in powder overnight and yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: dry it out that little extra bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you would have a much easier
time sifting with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about getting your material to
the perfect texture, the perfect place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dry sifting is definitely not a
misnomer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is to be done dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the reasons I don't really
support the dry ice method.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're using fresh material and that wax
membrane is just a little too fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so
[SPEAKER_04]: let's see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, a little bit of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, this is his other trick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have the balance?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's supposed to give us a second
grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got two very distinct colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's very blonde and one's quite dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very green.
[SPEAKER_05]: Choose your weapon.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm going to get a little water
in there for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a pendant ring from Cory that's
roughly about that size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, just without the big sidecar.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Renee full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, I bet you that tasted good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that tastes spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you could all taste that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also very sticky on this second grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely no slouch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell it came out before you were
ready for it to come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm quite excited about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, was that nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it was, was just, that was a
vapor hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's our little trick that gives
you a rip each time you do that little 10
[SPEAKER_05]: to 15 second trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think next up we're going to get rid of
the little screens, step up to the big boy
[SPEAKER_05]: screens and make some sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got the Renee powdered up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still a little bit of in nut form here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a good idea when you're working
with herb that has a tiny little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And your real key is that you're trying to
dry sift is to spread it out thin on the
[SPEAKER_05]: screen and go puff bowls for about a half
an hour or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we will happily do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what we're going to do right
now while this sits here and gets dry
sifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the center of the nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Renee also has a very tight strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flowers do grow very dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little tiny ball of wetness.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many weeks did you go with this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, these ones went eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my friend always took Renee nine to 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even cut it down at seven sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw in Hermes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why people cut it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing about Renee is it always
Hermes, but it never seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people cut it thinking when it Hermes
that they can keep the seeding from
[SPEAKER_05]: happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I swear you should do the experiment
next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow this strain a couple more weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't worry about the Hermes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not viable in Hermes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen like ever and I saw a lot
of Renee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of Renee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a fragrant plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a great, great, great smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go puff.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to sit here and we will see
you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like real soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in a quarter of a second,
I'll edit the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll just be like, and we'll just be
sitting and be like, hey, how's it going
[SPEAKER_05]: guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you get the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have got ourselves some chairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've switched spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you noticed, I was standing there and
Flav was standing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a mirror.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I grabbed the Haas, the Pacquiao G
Cross, the number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as the Kush two and three from
John.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got your MK Ultra that we cleaned.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a month or two ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I've got the Afghani,
the Haoma and I believe the Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got the Barb and the Haoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Haoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've got some flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say I'm ready to hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'm going to do a little mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the color on this Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: This Afghani, you can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like caramel cream.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure how well that worked,
but I'll make sure I give a little pan and
[SPEAKER_05]: show you the quality of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, this real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a little piece of it right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready for a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the... All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is just a pleasure to hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quality hash, quality glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's even kind of above and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way the recycling tube comes up
with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the honey drip, this is the recycling
tube when it comes up and goes back into
[SPEAKER_03]: the back of the queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting there with water in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a little bit right before it
drops in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, would you like me to... Oh,
the Barb actually, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a Barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is fabulous stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you heating up on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll use this here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't fuck with the honey buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just too good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a nice dab by anyone's
standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice dab of the Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like smoking a whole joint of the
head in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the smell of this rennet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love a situation where a good buddy
comes over with epic glass, beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: canvas, and says, let's sit around and
puff and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll film it all for your YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which reminds me, we're going to get him a
YouTube channel coming up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav421 will be the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're actually going to film his first
video tonight in the office later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think you'll get the idea of what
he's going to be doing for his channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll definitely be a channel that you
guys will want to check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be Flav421.
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that Barb?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was scrumptious.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was scrumptious, hey?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell you, I hit that Afghani and I am
just zooted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that is delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such unique color differences on
these, hey?
[SPEAKER_05]: And even since it's the same screen size,
same method, same everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the caramel cream look of that
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Afghani has the crazy color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's like crema on the top of an
espresso.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny how it's so much more appealing
than the almost greenish tinges of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Haoma and the Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, they're full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful, tasty, delicious resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That color just adds a certain... It makes
all the other ones really... I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: if I took these away, if I took this away,
these would look less green.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you put that next to any of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like even these ones down here look
more green with that sitting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting, all the differences of the
hashes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that the colors are the
essential oils, the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenoids at different cycles in their
life, whether they're new or old or
[SPEAKER_05]: mature.
[SPEAKER_05]: They tend to get darker.
[SPEAKER_05]: They tend to create different hues,
different colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely an interesting thing I've
found over the years, particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: photographing with the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this has a great texture to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like sand, soft sand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time for another rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, the Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one shall we do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go for this one right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little press.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a finger.
[SPEAKER_05]: People often ask me, is it dabbleable?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you tell me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty quick, actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly dabbleable.
Dabbleable.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: She still holds her own, even amongst the
professionals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get back in there, you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very dabbleable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find the smaller a piece is,
somehow the more enjoyable it is for a
[SPEAKER_05]: hash motor device.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I mean, with everything,
it's about the certain hit, the perk,
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount of water, the amount of
filtration that's coming through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like a faster, sharper hit,
less water filtration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all these pieces are quite small in
that sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's, I mean, in this one,
there's next to no water at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like literally drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's also, you know, there's like
less than an ounce of liquid in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with this one, too, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that looks like a shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's almost just, yeah, they're
probably just like an ounce in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a nice little push down on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puffing while the herb is drying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been loving this dry sifting lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon I'm going to be getting real heavy
back into wet washing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got these different levels of bubble
bags out right now, and I'm really sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: gearing up to, I've been gearing up all
winter, actually, to get out to the ice
[SPEAKER_05]: caps to do this ice cave bubble session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that will be the beginning
of a good, you know, intense spring and
[SPEAKER_05]: summer, you know, mad bubble washing,
lots of wet washing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you go up to the ice caps all through
the summertime?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm looking forward just for
that really being a sort of an event,
[SPEAKER_05]: a two day, one night, you know,
where we stay overnight, film the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: thing, make a bunch of bubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure I'll be going back too many
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's, it'll depend on how beyond
blown away and inspired we are by the
[SPEAKER_05]: experience, because you got to admit,
it sounds like a pretty good experience
[SPEAKER_05]: going to a, you know, million year old ice
cave on a glacier that you have to go for
[SPEAKER_05]: 45 minutes on a snowmobile just to get to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've just, yeah, I've got a lot of
friends with a lot of herb that needs
[SPEAKER_05]: washing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that seems like a good thing to get
the bags out and reestablish with people
[SPEAKER_05]: just the basics, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So many people have been experimenting and
coming up with different ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's important to go back to
the foundation that will assure purity,
[SPEAKER_05]: will assure a full melt product if you
have the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from there, go off and
experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as your quality, you know,
doesn't go down, sorry, not your quality,
[SPEAKER_05]: but your quantity really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about purity at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't make the bubble any better than
it is with the bags, but you can make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're getting the right,
you know, purity and the right yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more rip for Flav because we haven't
just been taking 20 rips each off camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've balanced that around a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much, just basically gently kind
of doing this sort of thing, much like
[SPEAKER_05]: what a tumbler would do as it was tumbling
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to grind it into the screen
really too hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dropping is always a nice, nice way to get
it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always suggests too, when you're done
dry sifting like this, to clean your
[SPEAKER_05]: screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't let it sit around dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you have a brush, or you can just
take them outside and kind of drop them,
[SPEAKER_05]: bang them on the side and they will
release.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely a good idea to do
something rather than to just leave it
[SPEAKER_05]: with resin on it like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're asking for trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: So gently put this one here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: A fresh card over there, Sir Flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little tile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very green and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you are, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do a little bit of carding with
this resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, generally we'll card this up for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a ton.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's maybe a half a gram to three
quarters of a gram here, but we'll card it
[SPEAKER_05]: up and we'll clean it into a nice little
pile of full pure heads, 99% anyway,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'll dab it up and then we'll smoke
it and possibly do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hope you learned a few things from
watching and hope you enjoyed yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav and I are going to get to carding
this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll end it with a few macro shots of
what we ended up getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the Rene, remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've cleaned the Rene up and we have
our last and final third grade,
[SPEAKER_05]: our second grade and our first grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: This
[SPEAKER_05]: will be the dabble bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't get a ton, but there it is
broken up into three, three bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you were sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our star is reaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you were resting, we are
blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: From school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reshape them guns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you slowly can't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're lovely.
