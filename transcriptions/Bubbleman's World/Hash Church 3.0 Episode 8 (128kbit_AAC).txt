[SPEAKER_08]: computer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never gone live on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that lots of people use Facebook,
you know, like all the mass murders when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're killing people at shopping centers
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I want to say welcome to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a strange hash church.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first one I've ever gone live
on Facebook because YouTube just wasn't
[SPEAKER_08]: working for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome everyone to hash church 3.0
episode six, really just going to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: hash talk today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I'm not sure how to share this,
but it would be very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be very good to go into the
YouTube chat really quick where everyone's
[SPEAKER_08]: legitimately waiting for us to go live
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I should do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's let's start the discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys can start the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, uh, uh, while I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So go ahead, do your thing and talk guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colin, you're picking up the slack.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for you, Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the first electronic instrument?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the first electronic instrument.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, uh, wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's not the theremin.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something before the theremin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep going back to the theremin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is the theremin, but I'm not
sure that's why I asked.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is the theremin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, that's a creation.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a collaboration actually between
Bogmogue, uh, American designer and
[SPEAKER_11]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe the European friend of his,
I don't, we should, we should look this
[SPEAKER_11]: up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it's a very important, very important
point in, uh, in creation of music,
[SPEAKER_11]: musical instruments.
[SPEAKER_11]: It really set the tone for, uh,
20th, the 20th and 21st century and where
[SPEAKER_11]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened shortly after a pretty intense
mushroom journey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just most likely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just like what's that Josh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is, it is the theremin actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite movies is the Davey or
Stood Still.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not Bob Mogue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Leon Theremin.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: No figure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: The way to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Question for you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was your first variety that you
created?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a what?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a what?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make an outcross or a new hybrid out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be honest, the first decade I
grew, I really grew land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one I planted was Mexican,
but somebody stole it before it flowered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't get so far with it,
but I tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the first hybrid that, I created was a
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was your first thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that went on to touch.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is important for the
audience because I I've been really the
[SPEAKER_11]: last few years, I guess I've been really
diving into the genomic aspect and the
[SPEAKER_11]: genomic tagging, if you will, and better
understanding what we have in our hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: That variety has touched pretty much every
modern day cannabis variety that I've
[SPEAKER_11]: seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's very few that it hasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not only that, but I added some DNA
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually says SK number one in the
DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody who has SK1 DNA, I actually
own your variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should start sending me royalties.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, back in the day, Sam,
I remember you telling me that there was a
[SPEAKER_08]: terpene profile that was spiked on the GCL
or the GLC that you would recognize
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties that had skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_07]: You there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, but here's what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I made hybrids with skunk number one
and say a tie or a afghan or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I did the GC analysis,
terpene analysis of the mother skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother afghan, the mother tie and
sample F1 hybrids between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could recognize it just by the GC
printout that which ones were related to
[SPEAKER_01]: the skunk or the tie or the afghan just by
the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first discovered this 25,
30 years ago, I was blown away that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: that easy to recognize the canvas by just
its terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I certainly remember my first trip
to Amsterdam in 1995.
[SPEAKER_08]: And wow, was skunk number one in every
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone had the version of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what an incredible variety.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot of the stuff I made as a
younger self.
[SPEAKER_11]: Having it sequenced by Kevin McKernan
really shed a lot of light into actually
[SPEAKER_11]: how much of your variety, Sam,
have infiltrated all of the work that I've
[SPEAKER_11]: actually done unbeknownst to myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I wasn't even working with it
and it was all in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the beginning, mine was the most
consistent stable, multi hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you cross it with something else,
it usually made it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was using it for everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what year was that?
[SPEAKER_10]: What year was that created?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I released it in, I think,
76 or 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had worked on it for a year or two
before that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how much did that have an effect on
modern day hash making?
[SPEAKER_08]: That cultivar and how it got into so many
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to make hash from it with dry
sifting, which is what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But its hybrids don't always make hash
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember my two easiest ones to
make hash with was skunk number one and
[SPEAKER_01]: the variety from DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slee stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slee stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hybrid between it, the hash did
not work like it does with Slee stack and
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Slee stack crossed with skunk number
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there for all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit rained resin and it cleaned
really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slee stack was as easy as skunk to make a
really, really clean hash with dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I say we start a petition and get DNA to
bring back the Slee stack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the Slee stack at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing I've asked DNA over and
over and over is did they analyze the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile of Slee stack because it
was really unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both me and Rob found that as long as we
smoked Slee stack resin, we didn't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally I go to sleep at 10 o'clock at
night at the latest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I would smoke Slee stack,
I'd stay up till three o'clock and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: finally smoke some real couchlock weed to
knock me out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I found the ghost train haze the
same way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, smoking that at night is
not the best idea if you actually want to
[SPEAKER_08]: go to sleep at any point in time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's that good, you have to sacrifice
a little bit of sleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I wanted to welcome Dave Sullivan to
the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's never... I never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to welcome...
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will interrupt everybody because what I
have to say is so important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ever stop, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you in every way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just such a blessing to have you
here and hear your voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I definitely miss you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Being able to come and hang out with you
and puff bowls and spend time in your
[SPEAKER_08]: place.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely sucks not being able to do
that, but...
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have it working in YouTube now,
Marcus?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it working in YouTube?
[SPEAKER_08]: I went live on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got... I've shared the Facebook
link in the YouTube chat a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be maybe a hundred people
or something on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So back to welcoming Dave Sullivan into
the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: His first hashtag episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met Dave through Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be creating some mics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it was Colin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always like the music guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who is obsessed with perfect
sounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: For whatever reason, your mic is like
Johnny B's mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just creates the craziest feedback when
it's not muted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's muted.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just unmuted myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I muted you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're muted again.
[SPEAKER_08]: But once again, three times a charm,
Dave.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to welcome Dave Sullivan to the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's an interesting fellow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked what he had to say on the DEM Pure
videos that they've been doing for the
[SPEAKER_08]: last couple of months.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I wanted to introduce you,
dude, and tell the Hash Church audience a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit about yourself and how you came
to find yourself here on the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my name is Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in Oregon and we have a sort of
organic vegetable farm here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a bunch of acreage of market crops
for farmers markets and then restaurants
[SPEAKER_06]: and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a rec farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been growing cannabis and
vegetables for, you know, approaching 25
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're obviously growing herbs as well
amongst your foods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've kind of got a unique system
where we sort of incorporate ganja into
[SPEAKER_06]: our crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that works really well for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so obviously with both growing food
and growing cannabis resin, you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: and doing it organically and
regeneratively and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm suspecting that you have long
understood the relationship of the way
[SPEAKER_08]: food and cannabis is produced and the way
it tastes and smells in an organic living
[SPEAKER_08]: soil environment versus one that is more
scrubbed of terroir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's an indoor grow now and it's got
artificial lights and it has a soilless
[SPEAKER_08]: medium and it's being fed salt nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys must be well aware of the
intensity of the differences of those two
[SPEAKER_08]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's obviously goes without
saying, but I think one of the real
[SPEAKER_06]: tangible ways you can see that around us
is all the, you know, we're in a pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: thriving farming community here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of monoculture around us,
rye grass and hazelnuts and sugar beet
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just even seeing the difference
between, you know, our neighbors in our
[SPEAKER_06]: soils that were managed organically and
building up soil over the years versus the
[SPEAKER_06]: conventional guys that are just blasting
herbicides and spraying 2, 4-D.
[SPEAKER_06]: The soil just has like a dead look to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely not making hashes in my
wheelhouse and I'm clearly not an expert
[SPEAKER_06]: like you guys, but I do know that we have
collaborated with some of the,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the best hash makers in the
state of Oregon and it's not even
[SPEAKER_06]: questionable to them that, you know,
living soil, sun-grown herb, they get the
[SPEAKER_06]: best turps off the hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say you are making hash by growing
it because if we as hash makers have
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing to wash, you know, hash makers
sometimes take a lot of credit,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we do a job, but the job that
you do is there's a lot more time that
[SPEAKER_08]: passes and there's a lot more variables
that you're exposed to than a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the loudest strains that
you have right now, Dave, going on in your
[SPEAKER_10]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I saw that you're getting towards
one of your first steps and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the joke these days is if it's not
named after a dessert or a fruit,
[SPEAKER_06]: then no one's really growing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in all seriousness, we have a really
good sour tangy cut from I think a
[SPEAKER_06]: Crockett breaded and that's super loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have a lot of, my friend
Crispy down in California, he's got a sour
[SPEAKER_06]: diesel headband that everything he crosses
into it is just, it's a thoroughbred.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the, I think one of the ones
that we're hearing is really good for hash
[SPEAKER_06]: is it's called This Is The Shit or Tits,
which is kind of a terrible name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Oregon doesn't like the name,
so we renamed it Grandpa's Finest after
[SPEAKER_06]: the brief who read it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an old timer from Cape A Valley in
California, but that's sour band onto an
[SPEAKER_06]: OG KB.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just has that really just greasy
kind of Himalayan structure to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you grown sour tangy in Northern
California and in the Willamette Valley or
[SPEAKER_10]: what are some differences that you've seen
from say Humboldt to the Willamette
[SPEAKER_10]: Valley?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for us, we didn't get the sour tangy
cut until after we weren't really growing
[SPEAKER_06]: down there anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've given it somebody down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Southern Humboldt, in particular,
I'm sure there's obviously good micro
[SPEAKER_06]: pockets in regions all over the world,
but that being the famous Emerald
[SPEAKER_06]: Triangle, not even all of Humboldt County,
obviously killer herb comes out of all of
[SPEAKER_06]: Humboldt County, but that particular zone
where the King's Range, the Lost Coast,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's about 28 miles that it was just two,
the terrain was just too steep and drastic
[SPEAKER_06]: to actually, it's the only, as you guys
probably all know, it's the only part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the California coast where the 101 doesn't
go through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about, I think 28 or so miles of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's literally just like a 4,000 foot
cliff to the ocean, the King's Peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you start getting east of the 101,
get into Eastern Humboldt and you grow
[SPEAKER_06]: really big weed, like sequoia weed,
like where it just gets gigantic,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's really hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you're obviously in the fog line
on the coast, you kind of deal with all
[SPEAKER_06]: the muck coming off the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reason that particular
microclimate is so sweet is because you
[SPEAKER_06]: literally have this 4,000 foot cliff
blocking all the muck off the ocean,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you still have that coastal pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, you almost, once you have like
a decent green thumb that's a few years
[SPEAKER_06]: behind your back, you almost have to try
to not grow good weed there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to not be able to pull it off
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Oregon, where we are here is,
Southern Oregon, a lot of good herb comes
[SPEAKER_06]: out of there, but the Willamette Valley
where we are, it's a little wet here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we have kind of developed our
style around is like kick-starting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're pulling plastic late July,
early August, so that late September after
[SPEAKER_06]: the equinox, you can finish under the
natural light without having to manipulate
[SPEAKER_06]: the schedule anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have found that the climate here in
September is almost identical to Southern
[SPEAKER_06]: Humboldt in October.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to kind of trick your plants into
thinking that it's October, California,
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't realize they're in Oregon,
we grow a really good herb that style.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with some Canadians in the house,
actually, we kind of learned that style.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say back in the mid 90s, we had some
buddies up in Qualcombes, is that the name
[SPEAKER_06]: of the zone up near?
[SPEAKER_06]: Vancouver Island?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no, no, it's near Whistler.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a bunch of lakes up there,
Pemberton and Qualcombes.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not Qualcombes, Qualcombes on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these guys there, they were just kind
of terracing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the name of it will come to me,
but it was like a really cool tucked away,
[SPEAKER_06]: like way remote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yalicum Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yalicum Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it, that's it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to drive through Lillooet to get
there, and I've dirt biked all over those
[SPEAKER_08]: mountains, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's such a sweet spot, like wild on
land.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big carpenter lake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's what all my buddies did
there, they would just kind of terrace the
[SPEAKER_06]: hillsides and just sort of grill style
with shade cloth, but they would just tarp
[SPEAKER_06]: their whole gardens to get stuff to finish
there because the season was so short.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really close to Gold Bridge and
Braylorne, which is really super cool,
[SPEAKER_08]: like very unique little town that used to
be for the gold mines, but now it's like
[SPEAKER_08]: used by professional skiers and
snowboarders, photographers and sledders
[SPEAKER_08]: all through the winter.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've seen any Canadian films,
you know, Teton movies and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_08]: Braylorne is always representing super
steep gnarly mountains and incredible
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful snow, and I've got quite a few
friends for a town of, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: 46 people or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably know 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was a really cool zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely made an impression on me,
and we kind of, I've been in Oregon the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole time, I've been on the West Coast,
but we had a property in Humboldt that we
[SPEAKER_06]: were managing while we were farming up
here, and we kind of bit their style on
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our early years down there,
just to not have all the harvest come in
[SPEAKER_06]: at the same time with a small crew,
you can kind of stagger it, but here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon, to grow like the longer kind of
really greasy strains, you kind of have to
[SPEAKER_06]: kickstart them to get them to finish here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were light depping up there in
Northern BC in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, talk about big plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul Hale in the house is from SubSchool
and Vertemnis Farms, is well known to grow
[SPEAKER_10]: 20 pound plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I right, Paul?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're lucky enough to do two of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been growing herb a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off back in Virginia and
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the 90s, and early 2000s,
went out to Amsterdam, got really
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated to start getting into hash,
but it was working with all indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things progressed and we got into a
farm and started getting experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor, started utilizing some of the
same things we had learned indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor, and one of those things was root
space was a really, really big deal for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, along with the long veg time,
and of course with some good fertile soil
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we did that outdoors after
getting some advice from some other
[SPEAKER_00]: friends who were saying things along those
lines, the yield started exploding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to have plants that were
framed 10 feet tall that were in smart
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, maybe 400 gallon smart pots,
and then the exact same frame with the
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited root space growing literally
side by side the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants would end up about the same
size overall, but our yield would be 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 13 pounds on the big hole,
and it would be four or five pounds on the
[SPEAKER_00]: little smart pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that happened, we just ran with it
and dug 12 by 12 holes, got them highly
[SPEAKER_00]: amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: The years that we got the two 20 pounders,
we both had them in the ground at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end of April under some supplemental
lighting to keep them from flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really magical when it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes an amazing season.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never forget my friend from Overgrow,
the mullum bimby madman who I used to
[SPEAKER_08]: talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was one of my first Australian
customers that bought bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess his father had been involved
in just really crossing the shit out of
[SPEAKER_08]: this cultivar for years that ended up
being the mullum bimby madness.
[SPEAKER_08]: This dude would just be like, no,
you got to try it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to try it, and trying to send me
nugs and stuff, and I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_08]: no, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like the 90s.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the end, I ended up getting some
beautiful seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have to this day, but he sent me
photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: This goes to show you how far back it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were actual photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no digital sending pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: He sent me these photos of this mullum
bimby plant that ended up being,
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it was about 10 to 12 feet tall,
but it was 18 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_08]: He ended up just getting this enormous
amount of cannabis off.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was close to 20 pounds and just
beautiful exotic sativa, the mullum bimby
[SPEAKER_08]: madness.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure Skunkman Sam probably knows more
than I do about the strain, but it was
[SPEAKER_08]: slapped with everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just kind of like the way the Hayes
Brothers did it, Sam, where it was just
[SPEAKER_08]: taking different things that came in and
throwing it in.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the first time I ever saw the
largest plant on Overgirl, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_11]: is that that guy posted those for the
first time, and it literally lit our small
[SPEAKER_11]: community on fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just all kind of ... I'd never seen 20
pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten really close both seasons we
had the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bunch of 18 and 19 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That year, we had 32 plants, and we got a
little over 440 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was truly a blessed season and just
eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to say, though, is that on
the biggest plants we've grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've also been the healthiest,
and they come out amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been questioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think, these older plants,
they've been through a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to really put out and
have the same THC content, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, the bigger plants were better
than our smaller plants were at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: The year you grew those eight big
counters, tell me about that harvest
[SPEAKER_08]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they clones or were they seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both times that we've had the big harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Snow Wookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Snow Wookie was the first one that we
did it, and then the Triple Goddess was
[SPEAKER_00]: the second one we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Snow Wookie, we have a picture on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe 11 people, all holding hands
with their arms spread out, was about
[SPEAKER_00]: where we measured the circumference on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big were the stairs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my old- Wookie,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually had a bunch of rain and heavy
winds come through right a couple days
[SPEAKER_00]: before we were harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the support for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three steel cages to hold it in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind hit it, and she crushed all the
three steel cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to use a come along and put a
T-post.
[SPEAKER_00]: We nailed all the way down into the ground
to stand her back up, to limp her through
[SPEAKER_00]: the last few days of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the weight of that plant, like wet,
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took your two hands, could you get
your fingers around the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you couldn't get them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually- That's the way I judge them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either a tree or they ain't a
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a lot of really fun videos where
we'd have people inside the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing and smoking, and then walk out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get perspective of how big those things
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely was a- I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you get the gold fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got the giant fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fun when they get that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to be able to show people what's
happening, they've never seen that before,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had two friends in Southern Oregon that
grow really big like that, which is the
[SPEAKER_10]: Snodgrass family.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got some plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Williams Wonder was one plant from
down in Southern Oregon that got really,
[SPEAKER_10]: really big.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another friend named Jim down there who
had grown some really big plants as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that they would harvest the outside
of the plant at first and let the inside
[SPEAKER_10]: grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd go out within a week or two and
then they would get say two to three
[SPEAKER_10]: harvests off these particular varietals
and they did come from seed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that as well even with the Snow
Wookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 20 pounds that we took was only the
first harvest, only the buds that we
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled down off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even posted or talked about the
second and then the third harvest because
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're going to put that weight
together, at that point it's just silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is all of that stuff went to
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that was smaller went to hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kept giving.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the way the camera even flipped
right when you went back.
[SPEAKER_08]: The timing was perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really showed that there was a good
quality and a good amount of hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in the Sierras, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the Sierras.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located ... Well, on the farm that
we did the 20 pounds that we were at 1,800
[SPEAKER_00]: feet, the farm that we're on now is at
2,600, so we're a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we get amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both spots get full sun all the way from
the beginning of the day to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located between Tahoe and
Placerville, kind of in the middle right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we've had going on really
difficult is at the end of last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: a deputy was killed on a grow about 10
miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a grow that was run by cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sheriff has fully initiated raids
without warrants and all the legal ...
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody even with just plants is getting
shot down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole lot of drama around us,
but what it's made us do is it's made us
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of regroup the plan for our farm and
what we're going to get into for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: season, the following season here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that's going to entail is a big
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four rows 12 feet wide that we
grow in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant gets about 12 by 12 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to do is we're going to
fill the center walkway between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: rows to make a 30 foot wide row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to put six plants in
greenhouses in those rows and try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them into the ground around February,
March at the latest and see what this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's really capable of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover it and then the
greenhouse is going to become part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that's going to hold it in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect opportunity to kind of back
down on our plan numbers, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us a chance to really see how big we
can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really fired up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting planning right now and yeah,
it's going to be fun to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown anything more than about
25 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 25 feet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, about 25 feet tall was the biggest,
tallest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the bookie was our tallest
and I want to say she was about 17 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The triple goddess was really unbelievable
because I didn't take any pictures of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was only six or seven feet tall,
but she was so big around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key with that one was these big long
branches and the triple goddess,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the OG that was in it,
just made all these popcorn nugs from the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the stalk all the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked at that plant, I wasn't even
really that excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it and it was bigger and maybe
15 pounds, 16 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, but it's just not that
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it hit the scale though, again,
just shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little flark, but now when we harvest
it all the way to the bone, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: leave anything for the second and third
harvest on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything more than 10 or 12 pounds is a
fucking treat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is a treat.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure, what a beautiful thing to just
be able to tour one day where you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: like, oh, let's go visit the, oh,
it's the giant redwoods.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh look honey, it's the giant
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should probably pull in for a little
tour with the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what was fun?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember saying to my wife, well,
which one are we going to smoke in today,
hon?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like eating in a tree house.
[SPEAKER_08]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and I'm sure it made a whole hell of
a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to know with cannabis,
especially when the government's all sort
[SPEAKER_08]: of like, you're allowed to have four
plants and that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our county's been really good to us for a
lot of years, but with what happened with
[SPEAKER_00]: the deputy last year, I just feel that
they're going full throttle with
[SPEAKER_00]: eradication, no matter what the levels
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an up and down ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll play with six plants next year and
have a blast doing it, so it's all good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have a 98 plant license here that
I can grow for my medical license,
[SPEAKER_08]: or if I wanted to grow on the other side
of things recreationally, I guess we're
[SPEAKER_08]: just allowed four.
[SPEAKER_08]: Better than nothing for sure, but at the
same time, I'm kind of looking forward to
[SPEAKER_08]: the day where we don't treat cannabis like
plutonium and feel that you have to
[SPEAKER_08]: protect the whole world from it and that
really you have to limit it in any way,
[SPEAKER_08]: shape or form.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't do that with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't do it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would truly be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to when in California,
you can grow it like Christmas trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: allow people to come and pick their own
mature plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow 100,000 on your field and then
you let people come and pick their own one
[SPEAKER_01]: or two kilo or three kilo plants and sell
to them for 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrapping them up in the plastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, how about you ask them, do you want
me to drill a hole in the bottom of it for
[SPEAKER_09]: you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam, on the East Coast, some people do
that on their hemp farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: They allow people to come and they'll
weigh it out for them after they've walked
[SPEAKER_11]: through the field.
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting to become a thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Brian.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's sheep's got farms.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Maine does that.
[SPEAKER_12]: They grow acreage for hemp and really high
quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually grew the same strains last
year, you know, suverhaze, Hawaii and Lyft
[SPEAKER_12]: are all these really pretty good strains
and they did a free pick your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a temp it's got below 0.3% THC,
yes?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do they value it?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the cost that they charge per wet
weight?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, Brian.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe he has some insight.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually not sure myself in terms of
wet weight.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's such a processing energy to it and
space provided that I think it's almost a
[SPEAKER_12]: little bit of it's kind of like a good
luck in a way with it and hopefully they
[SPEAKER_12]: know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll tell you, in Switzerland in
2001 when I was driving from Valhusen in
[SPEAKER_08]: the north down to Lugano in the south,
we would pass these you picks and
[SPEAKER_08]: Switzerland has these things all over.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like flower ones where you just
drop some Swiss Franks in the little
[SPEAKER_08]: mailbox thing and you can pick a big
bouquet of flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they started planting cannabis
amongst those you picks and you could
[SPEAKER_08]: legitimately not that I needed to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hanging out with Breeder Steve and
he had tunnels full of dank weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was definitely some of the nicer
weed in Switzerland that I saw.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't really, you know, do it,
but I thought, wow, that is the coolest
[SPEAKER_08]: thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you can just go snip some branches
off that bad boy and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: go home and make a tincture or do whatever
it is you want with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, it was still just fresh out of the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis was still very illegal
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then here was Switzerland where in
Valhusen it was like football fields,
[SPEAKER_08]: giant, huge grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the people in Switzerland grew so
much those years that it all rotted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they had no, they didn't understand
the space that cannabis took to dry in the
[SPEAKER_08]: environment that was required.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all sorts of cannabis rotted on the
stem and also in the barns.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what an incredible sight to see back
then.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you used to go quite a bit too
back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw thousands and thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but my friends were using
mobile darkening units.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were like hoop causes that could
be moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a few hundred of these hoop
causes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would, because I was there for
seed production, not weed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we would do is darken the plants
off for two, three, four weeks at the
[SPEAKER_01]: most, pollinate it, and then move the
darkening system to the next group of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seeds would finish mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would revenge and not have any mold
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Switzerland, if you grow
varieties, it can be a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with mold and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this worked out really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants never even finished flowering,
but they still had pretty good seed
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was totally easy to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that in the north or where?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was near Zurich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was near Zurich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zurich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zurich.
[SPEAKER_08]: Zurich.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been to Switzerland in a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to really quite enjoy going there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very much similar, at least in parts,
to British Columbia with the big mountains
[SPEAKER_08]: and forests.
[SPEAKER_08]: And epicness that's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, welcome Logan in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that Logan in the house?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, respect, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early morning in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize how much earlier Hawaii
was than BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like us for the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the alarm clock didn't go off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'm here, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, happy to have you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I met Logan on one of the
Dragonfly Earth Medicine shows and really
[SPEAKER_08]: just loved his transparency and his truth
and his commitment to his mission.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just resonated with him,
pun intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Logan, are you drinking my tea?
[SPEAKER_03]: This morning, I recently quit the coffee
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Kona coffee is big over here,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I recently did that for health reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today, in the spirit of Dragonfly
Earth Medicine, I made some cacao.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks like a mate cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother actually gifted me these
because we do the mate quite often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys ever taken mate and ran it
through your bubble bags?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have a glandular resin gland?
[SPEAKER_08]: It does indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you getting down with a few
different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day, you know, I just was
like, I was kind of like, well,
[SPEAKER_08]: there must be something to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I went on, you know, I didn't
understand the language a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know a lot of the terms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it was difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was difficult to do research on
something that you didn't really know the
[SPEAKER_08]: terms for.
[SPEAKER_08]: But eventually, I found an article from a
from a university on glandular trichomes
[SPEAKER_08]: of mint.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I bought some mint and I went
home and I made some mint hash,
[SPEAKER_08]: ran it in my bubble bags, made this little
gummy mint hash, you know, dried it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of like, what should I do with
it?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, I'm going to have a bong
rip of it, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I slapped the mint hash in the bong and
I took a big bong rip and I blew it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just like it was smooth and
just pleasant that I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, that that was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I say a bong rip, like because I
was now trained in the art of full melt
[SPEAKER_08]: first, of course, by, you know,
the maestro Skunkman Sam in ninety five
[SPEAKER_08]: via not from but via a friend of his.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw the first full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it don't bubble, it ain't worth the
trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that really sort of opened my eyes to
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would waft the match or the beeline.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a match back then over the over the
hash to kind of allow it to melt and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff, not really burn it harsh.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why it was just this beautiful,
pleasant experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd really vaporized the mint.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then I was like, well, I got to do this
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like maybe maybe it'll sue the bong rip.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I put a bunch of full melt hash
in and some mint hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I took a rip of that through the tube
and was like just blown away how I didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that meant so I go and I do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go onto the Internet and I'm like mint
suppress cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like R.J.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reynolds, thirty two million dollars study
to come up with mentholated cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, well, thirty two million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used a set of bubble bags and submit and
a bong.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminded me of the the Americans
spending all that money for the pen that
[SPEAKER_08]: would write in space.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Russians just used a pencil.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's why, you know, in in their
system, the dumbest ideas rise to the top
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they get funded with all the
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, but I think it was I think
it was a straight concentrates is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: who I've been been following recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing a bunch of glandular
extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they did hops recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he is working on something
else, too, recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They realize that, you know, that those
glands are really just the protection
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanism, not just but our function as a
highly evolved protection mechanism for
[SPEAKER_03]: these different plants in this wonderful
plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for our consciousness, talk about a
protective mechanism.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's OK, Marcus, if we call you a mint
head.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get hard into the mint.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to admit, Sam, that was the last
batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just joking, because in L.A.,
back in the 70s, minkheads, they would put
[SPEAKER_01]: PCP on mint and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called them minkheads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bro, then you can definitely call me a
minkhead.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like my regular ritual.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it in a salt and pepper shaker.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the PCP shaker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then awake and bake, you wake and fry.
[SPEAKER_10]: That puts a new meaning to the name fin
mint.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not a fan of disassociative drugs
like PCP and like Belladonna and like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, just I don't like drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ketamine is the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, any drug that you have forgotten
that you've taken a drug while you're
[SPEAKER_08]: super lit and frying hard, I'm not
interested in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Sylvia, it's the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Sylvia was I've seen too many bad
experiences in Lugano with that Sylvia
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It always would start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Peter Steve used to think it was
funny as hell.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trust me, it was part of what made it even
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him if he ever does that to me,
it'd be the last thing he fucking did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll never forget when he did it to
Jorge Cervantes, because I was sitting
[SPEAKER_08]: there with him and it was just us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said to Jorge, hey, do you want to
get higher than you've ever been with a
[SPEAKER_08]: bong?
[SPEAKER_08]: And passed him like the, you know,
the lighter in the bong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jorge was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jorge doesn't even smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: He hit this bowl like nobody's business,
finished it right off and then literally
[SPEAKER_08]: proceeded like I've never seen anything
like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he just you could see the moment
where he was like realized he was in this
[SPEAKER_08]: full blown terror trip and he just like
grabbed the side of his face and screamed
[SPEAKER_08]: this terrible scream inside the warehouse
at Steve's place in Lugano.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was not a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember it actually upset Annie Rankin
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: She got really upset with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do that to people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to follow Tim Leary's two
commandments of never giving people a
[SPEAKER_08]: psychedelic without their knowledge and
never trying to keep people from taking
[SPEAKER_08]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the two psychedelic commandments
that I can get behind personally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think all police officers should
probably do a healthy dose of LSD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should take their guns away
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that subject, what's it all like with
the Canadian police compared to American
[SPEAKER_03]: police?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we got all these police that just
love to beat people up and kill people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canadian police just got called to a,
what's it called?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a checkup.
[SPEAKER_08]: But really what it is is it's abuse of
power and it's usually a jilted spouse is
[SPEAKER_08]: like, oh, she has a history of mental
illness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you go check up on her?
[SPEAKER_08]: So they rolled up on this native woman and
killed her in her home.
[SPEAKER_08]: This happened like two weeks ago,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can Canadian police carry guns?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tasers and guns, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have the level of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously we don't have the amount of
people that are down in the US,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that should happen two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one can deny it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Checking up on her and end up killing her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two people got killed out in, I think it
was New Brunswick or maybe it was Nova
[SPEAKER_10]: Scotia, but I think it was New Brunswick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another indigenous man got killed out
there and then other people saw the chief
[SPEAKER_10]: that got attacked.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was in March.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say the biggest issue with police
up here that's super alarming and even not
[SPEAKER_10]: with police, but it's the missing and
murdered indigenous women.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a massive, massive problem up here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's highways up here that are not
associated with the police, that are
[SPEAKER_10]: associated with truckers and different
people on the road that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: killing of indigenous women.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alarming.
[SPEAKER_10]: British Columbian cops don't have to have
cameras on their body either.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's another push here in
British Columbia, is to have cops have
[SPEAKER_10]: that accountability of having body cams.
[SPEAKER_10]: Vancouver is a well-known... There's some
really, really bad spots in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_10]: as beautiful as it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a spectacular city to visit and
everything, but there's some heavy duty
[SPEAKER_10]: homeless spots and hardcore spots in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Canada is known as a wonderful country and
generally a lot of the people are super,
[SPEAKER_10]: super awesome, but there is a definite
undertone of racism.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in Vancouver is the largest Sikh
population outside of India.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not funny, but Vancouver is known as
Hong-Cover.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's funny, but anyway, there's a
lot of people... A lot in Toronto also.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so that's some of the stuff
happening up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the biker element too,
and they really hush up the police on a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of stuff the bikers do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like some intelligent people
could really figure this stuff out really
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly and for some reason they choose
not to, and not to harp on that subject
[SPEAKER_03]: for too long and keep it positive around
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the police in America are protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're protected by the police unions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to do is declare the police
unions, domestic terrorist groups and get
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuck rid of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they need to demilitarize the police
for certain because that was the start of
[SPEAKER_08]: the end right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need these guys in fully armored
vehicles with grenades and machine guns
[SPEAKER_08]: and huge bulletproof everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, police is just like, you need to...
You're there to help people, not murder
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_10]: De-escalation and human rights,
humanistic intervention, people would be
[SPEAKER_10]: nice to go around with the cops.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of mental illness out there
and I don't even know how you legitimately
[SPEAKER_10]: create a police force that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand the difficulty in that,
but... I think the dialogue is important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the dialogue is important.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I haven't been involved in the
dialogue too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've really been just watching and reading
and listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny because I've been called out by
a few people like, hey, you're not backing
[SPEAKER_08]: us up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh yeah, I'm going to do
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I've planned to do, I've contacted my
partner, Claude from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, is there a way to get... This
is mainly about Black Lives Matter and the
[SPEAKER_08]: discussion that's going on right now with
the police murdering black men in this
[SPEAKER_08]: accelerated way and this whole white
privilege.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, well, geez, how can I use my
platform to involve that conversation?
[SPEAKER_08]: I called my buddy Claude and I said,
hey, would Richie Spice and some other
[SPEAKER_08]: artists be interested and maybe we could
get Knife.
[SPEAKER_08]: This amazing Rastafarian PhD that I've had
on Hash Church before is just brilliant.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's on both sides of the fence from the
Rastafarian deep knowledge, elder
[SPEAKER_08]: knowledge, but also from the schooled and
educated side of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe get John Nine, who's a female artist
from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: Offer them the platform to speak about
white privilege, to speak about Rastafari
[SPEAKER_08]: and liberty and the music and cannabis and
ganja and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was excited when I offered that to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a show I'm going to try and get
going on Hash Church here in the very near
[SPEAKER_08]: future while this conversation is fresh.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that we can do to use the
platform to give more exposure to a very
[SPEAKER_08]: important conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on Friday we held an event.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a record shop and a smoke shop in
town and it's a roots and culture shop,
[SPEAKER_03]: a Rasta shop here in Kona town.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an end police brutality,
equal rights and justice for all,
[SPEAKER_03]: peaceful protest, which was actually just
a musical dance hall.
[SPEAKER_03]: We served free food, free ITAL food for
the community and handed that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were just loving life, man,
because of all this Corona BS and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone came out and you could just see
the people and the awakening that's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening around the world because of
these serious, serious issues coming to
[SPEAKER_03]: the forefront of people's minds and
everyone have to kind of reevaluate what
[SPEAKER_03]: their position on the earth is and really
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is life and what is health and all
these kinds of questions that are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no denying it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just even with whatever COVID-19 is,
the one thing that I've seen that's come
[SPEAKER_08]: out of it that I was really quite excited
about was the interest that people had to
[SPEAKER_08]: produce their own food and the interest
that they had to plant a garden and to
[SPEAKER_08]: start having a discussion about how do you
plant a garden?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do you get seeds?
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you plant your garden in?
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of soil do you use?
[SPEAKER_08]: How often do you water it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of a sudden these, you know,
they weren't talking about what was on
[SPEAKER_08]: Seinfeld last week.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were talking about those
conversations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And although I have a lot of friends that
are involved in those conversations
[SPEAKER_08]: already, I started hearing people who have
never been involved in those conversations
[SPEAKER_08]: starting to say these things and having
these conversations with their kids
[SPEAKER_08]: because their kids aren't at school
anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're at home nonstop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, well, you can only watch so
much Seinfeld.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's plant a garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's plant some seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's grow some food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's check out the relationship that we
have with the earth that produces the
[SPEAKER_08]: substances that we need to energize our
bodies to continue on in this thing called
[SPEAKER_08]: life.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a pretty nice little revelation
that I had.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Dragonfly Earth Medicine starting
these shows right at the time also showed
[SPEAKER_08]: me that they were seeing it as well,
that they were tuning into that as well,
[SPEAKER_08]: that the choir is always there to preach
to, but that there was this new group that
[SPEAKER_08]: was willing to listen now and what timing
for their educational soil health series.
[SPEAKER_08]: Props to that, Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the true revolution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going, Colin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to kind of work off of
what you were touching on, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_11]: is what we're in an awakening right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that awakening is pouring over into
social injustice.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's highlighting and putting a microscope
on the things that should have had a
[SPEAKER_11]: microscope on them a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to bring everyone's voice
together to fight for the justice that
[SPEAKER_11]: needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can be better for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can all be more aware of ourselves,
the surroundings that we put ourselves in,
[SPEAKER_11]: and ultimately the future that we hold in
front of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think I'm doing my best as a
privileged person in all this to listen to
[SPEAKER_11]: and learn to try to understand all of the
different facets of all of this and to
[SPEAKER_11]: support and be a support system in any way
I can.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's, you know, that's, Marcus,
doing that show would be great,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and putting some sponsors
together, you know, that people can donate
[SPEAKER_11]: to for a good cause would be really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if anyone's out there
listening now, I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_11]: pick a great organization to support.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to, you know, make sure that whatever
you're giving to that organization is
[SPEAKER_11]: going to the cause that you're mostly
profoundly, you know, getting behind,
[SPEAKER_11]: so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all have a lot more faith in humanity
than I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've been around less than you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen way more hardship than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja farmers hold the magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also remember during the recent
demonstration, you know, at Berkeley when
[SPEAKER_01]: they looted a bunch of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a bummer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's, I feel like that's a lot of
organized crime taking advantage of the
[SPEAKER_11]: broken system.
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately, a lot of, there's a lot
of good outfits that did get hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Magnolia got hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Berkeley patients groups got
hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnolia got hit three times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard Harborside was just, they just
wiped everything out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel for all of those businesses and
it is a shame.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's a tough one when you see
things like that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones we need to reach the most are the
organized criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones whose minds have to be
turned around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to remember that the Brotherhood
of Eternal Love were a bunch of biker
[SPEAKER_01]: criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they turned on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a quick question for everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is everyone puffing on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'm puffing on this concentrated X
DNA genetics, banana, strawberry banana
[SPEAKER_08]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm puffing on this variety that I had
made actually Sam called square.
[SPEAKER_11]: I called it square wave and it's a Hindu
Kush times skunk one times tie.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's the dumper has makes the most 90
you out of any variety that I've ran to
[SPEAKER_11]: date that I've been collecting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, this is press, but this is press
from, uh, from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's pulling out the jars.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, some nice things on the screen right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, also have a solventless cart of,
uh, Rosetta stone that I made,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, that I'm trying, I'm testing right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's really quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosetta stone has a more of a Jack's Jack
Herrera kind of vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is some strawberry Angela.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're starting to get, we're starting to
get more requests for people that want to
[SPEAKER_10]: suppress hemp and make cash out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's someone that's like, Oh yeah,
we need some, a bunch of hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I know there's a, have you guys
been hearing about that or what's up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've been, I've been pressing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I think there's a big push for people
trying to get solventless products on the
[SPEAKER_11]: market from hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, it's a real viscous
material.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody's been pressing
any of it or watched any, uh, hemp before,
[SPEAKER_11]: but, uh, it's mainly like a 45,
25 kind of grit to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard friends don't let friends press.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You press hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's real viscous too because of the lack
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: So most of the people up in Canada have to
grow good hemp under a, um, regular like
[SPEAKER_10]: recreational license, because if you get a
hemp license in Canada, you're basically
[SPEAKER_10]: locked into their varietals, which are not
representative of high CBD cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, you have to kind of have a
regular recreational license in order to
[SPEAKER_10]: even bring, you know, be able to bring in
varietals into your scene.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, you have to do it when you
start your license because you can't bring
[SPEAKER_10]: it in afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring varieties in afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ship seeds to, uh, I shipped a kilo a
week ago with a Canadian import license
[SPEAKER_01]: and with all the legal certificates
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's some restrictions.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's some type of restriction for
some.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just talking to David Perrone on
the, uh, from the green organic Dutchman
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's, there's, you know,
for some, um, they can't just bring in
[SPEAKER_10]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to create them after they have
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't, again, there's a lot of
logistics to it, but I know that way for
[SPEAKER_10]: our starting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of it has to do with people
all have different levels of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cause I I'll tell you, I had a friend
of mine tell me that absolutely no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you bring seeds into Canada?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, okay, like I know people
doing it, but you know, that's neither
[SPEAKER_08]: here nor there legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've supplied 20 of the LPs in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and I can tell you, I was in an LP
in Canada staring at these beautiful skunk
[SPEAKER_08]: haze plants in, um, in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, man, like I was like,
where did you get these?
[SPEAKER_08]: At first I said, what are these?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said they're skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, where did you get these?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, he didn't really know,
but I knew, I knew right away where they
[SPEAKER_08]: came from and they were beautiful,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were like seven, eight feet tall,
huge, big rows of them and just really
[SPEAKER_08]: healthy and resonance and had my mouth
watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a quick, a quick input onto the
squishing hemp, not to change back to an
[SPEAKER_03]: old subject, but just real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I was always, I was always a
little skeptical of the CBD push.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it first came out, I owned a smoke
shop and we, you know, we sold a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of CBD and my friends, Matt rise,
he was one of the first pushers of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I took the pills and I
smoked some of the early flowers and some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the early hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it, it was cool and
everything, but really when I got a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: ounce of some really high grade hemp
flowers from Oregon that my buddy grew
[SPEAKER_03]: all, you know, Korean natural farming
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took it home and I actually squished
it on my rosin press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the first time I took a really
fat, nice, you know, like a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: dab using, you know, the same technique I
would with some, you know, really good,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, fresh frozen and the experience from
smoking that hash convinced me about CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually got enough concentrated
form to actually be able to testify to the
[SPEAKER_03]: powers of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was only.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in the form of rosin from those
really high grade flowers that I was able
[SPEAKER_03]: to come up with that testimony.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I can actually tell patients what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making rosin out of a high CBD
variety, then the THC level is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: True.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not THC free.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is what makes it good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go one step further and say that
with no CBD, it's even better.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's time to change your name from
hemp guy to THC guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I concur, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, uh, most, most varieties
I've seen from test results on a,
[SPEAKER_11]: on a wide variety of, of, of, uh,
different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really anywhere from like four and
up in terms of percentages.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, very rarely is it actually at the
legal limit in which they're asking
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone to be at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, um, it's almost impossible to
produce high CBD varieties that fall
[SPEAKER_01]: within the legal limit because the CBD
synthases produces THC at a ratio of about
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 to one, which means that if you've got
20% THC, I mean 20% CBD, your CBD level is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be like, you know, more than 1%
THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, that's the, that's the beauty
of it all right now is that there's,
[SPEAKER_11]: there is very much a gray area.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, if we keep working
and working these lines, I think
[SPEAKER_11]: eventually, you know, as the farm bill
caught up in the, in the States,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, hopefully I think the
laws will catch up and everything will be
[SPEAKER_11]: worked out to reflect the plants,
you know, ability to produce those
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids and those major and minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody know how, um, how transparent
these testing companies are and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: how accurate these testings are and all
that, because I know just a lot can be
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulated with statistics and testing
and maybe even pay off a company or these
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone really looked into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are we just going to trust in science
at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own lab for the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your own lab as in you do the actual
testing itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: HPLC, gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our own lab set up a decade before.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's amazing Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm seeing, um, just from my own
experience, is that it depends on what
[SPEAKER_11]: instrumentation the lab has and the
investment they put into that said
[SPEAKER_11]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's say one lab, lab A will have gas
chromatography, HPLC and the lab B will
[SPEAKER_11]: have liquid chromatography.
[SPEAKER_11]: And while they're both maybe right for
those said labs, they're both going to
[SPEAKER_11]: give different end results and we trust
those end results to then go to market
[SPEAKER_11]: with.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the difficult aspect of where
the debacle, I guess, of labs right now is
[SPEAKER_11]: that there's no standardization for
anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're really left with trusting their
processes once we give them our material.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where I see the biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are published methodologies which
you can follow and you will get the same
[SPEAKER_01]: results with the same machinery with the
same materials.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but what I'm, what I'm illustrating is
the fact that no two, no, no two labs are
[SPEAKER_11]: the same where in my experience,
where most of them have their own set SOPs
[SPEAKER_11]: and instrumentation and one might not have
instrumentation that the other might have.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the biggest differentiation when
I send a test result out, like I don't
[SPEAKER_11]: want to name it, but there's certain
companies give me a higher test results
[SPEAKER_11]: and I see it from just the way that they
test stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there is a disconnect in terms
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a hemp farm out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hemp farm out here in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: This real quick, a hemp farm out here in
Hawaii that I know personally and he sent
[SPEAKER_03]: in three samples of the same exact plant
and labeled them differently just to test
[SPEAKER_03]: the test lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got three different results.
[SPEAKER_10]: How different were they?
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple points or like significant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, not super significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but, but enough to where maybe,
Hey, I can't sell that batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that kind of, you know, that,
that would matter, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean in terms of the pesticide
screening or the heavy metal or more,
[SPEAKER_03]: more like the percentage, like all of a
sudden you see my PHC and now you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: sell that batch legally or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, I see, I see it from lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's definitely, I don't know,
Sam, if you've seen this, but I,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've, I've been told there's a 30%
variance based on the testing methods that
[SPEAKER_11]: are used.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a huge variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identical machinery, identical protocol,
you get identical results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, I, I, when I set our lab
up, we had a lot of trouble getting
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally did obtain proper standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested them and we knew they were
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were claimed to be 98% THC when in
truth it was at 86% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also sent a sample to Dr. Brenneisen
in Switzerland and Dr. El Solay in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They confirmed my results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had identical results to them because
the three of us, we're doing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it seems like there's serious
scientific labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's these business labs that
open up that, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe they're given higher numbers,
maybe they're not as good at their jobs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they're not able to follow the
standards and the SOPs as well,
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's definitely, I mean,
if you want to see how accurate labs are
[SPEAKER_08]: really the only way would be to develop
your own system where you knew each and
[SPEAKER_08]: every time like Sam was getting accurate
results that were like verified by two
[SPEAKER_08]: outside labs, the El Solay lab in
Mississippi and the one in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are like big named labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you send that same material out
to two.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's expensive, but if I want to know the
accuracy, like I'll definitely send it to
[SPEAKER_08]: more than one lab and, you know,
see what kind of variations I get.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to send our weed to Prague and
get the hundred cannabinoid bioassay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of the big goal, you know,
get beyond 12 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's books and everything written on
all these cannabinoids, then why are we
[SPEAKER_10]: fooling around with 12 cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is it 2020 yet?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just wondering.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, hey Brian, I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering, just wondering about
Brian, you were doing a bunch of work on
[SPEAKER_10]: your farm and how's the best friend farms
development going?
[SPEAKER_10]: How's Maine feeling?
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the weather like?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've been talking to ancient green
and everyone out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just wondering, how's the vibe out
there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're having a great weather here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just got a little distracted, but yeah,
it's been beautiful, beautiful days.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're today even pushing, I think the
eighties here on the farm and I've back
[SPEAKER_12]: and forth with ancient green.
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to go see them next week actually
and finally get over to their farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've just been going crazy on the
vegetable tip and ornamentals even and
[SPEAKER_12]: seeing a lot of volunteers come up on the
land this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, just really connecting to the
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: The same, the same tip I think that most
people are feeling and kind of digging
[SPEAKER_12]: deep into thoughts and exploration just
through planting of local terroir and even
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the ground we walk on,
the air we breathe, the water that falls
[SPEAKER_12]: here and trying to be healed by the
medicine and fed by the food that comes
[SPEAKER_12]: from that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So working at everything every way we can,
trying to bring in birds with bird houses
[SPEAKER_12]: and introduce worms, hopefully have some
fish soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for everything, for all the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dragonfly, it's been definitely a lot of
learning through you guys in a short time
[SPEAKER_12]: already.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been super fun watching you develop
the farm and everything and see it rage
[SPEAKER_10]: and dogs and everything going on out there
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, all the way and everything,
mind, body, soul, all the way spirit even
[SPEAKER_12]: included here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my lady's been helping me with all the
gardening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Her thumbs are like fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Green, John Deere green.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been kind of having a nice
frothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the cannabinoid you're looking for
Dragonfly Farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: What cannabinoid are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, I'm looking for the one
that keeps the politicians alive through
[SPEAKER_10]: all sicknesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tell you when I find it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's not like I have a desired
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just am in recognition that there's over
100 cannabinoids in the plant and we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you tell me what I'm looking for
since you studied, you know, the plant in
[SPEAKER_10]: and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking to the wrong guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a recreational guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other cannabinoids do not get you
high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, and I love that you love
getting high.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just it just happens to be that
there's other ailments out there that the
[SPEAKER_10]: ganja helps.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's super useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why I'm asking you what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm asking you, what do you
want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want THC in the right dirt beans.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm looking for is.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're after THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're after THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Michael.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have much more to say other than
just I like the fractal of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that it's fractal medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm not going to just like throw
in the towel because we found THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I'm out there like believing there's
something more to it all.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I mean, I think THC is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm smoking weed right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I like the herbalist aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I mean, there's there's more
to the ganja than even just the resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mean, there's the roots hold,
you know, tremendous potential in healing
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we make our medicine, you know,
we're making whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think there's value to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think there's value to the
seed and to the stem.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know, Matt, you know, I would love
to hear more about endophytic and bacteria
[SPEAKER_10]: and fungi, which comes from the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, those are those are unknown
medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're just beginning to study
those.
[SPEAKER_10]: So do I believe there's more to the
cannabis than just THC?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe THC is going to get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to say there's nothing
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying it won't get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's all these other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I developed the world's first high CBD
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the same thing with CBC,
CBG, THCB, and another half dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were strictly for medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't for recreational use.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is getting high?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is getting high?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different for a lot of people,
but some people get high quite literally
[SPEAKER_01]: just to get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because they need it or they want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you can get high off of breath
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, to say that only THC gets high
is a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like smoking THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've gotten high off breath work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, I want to make a comment about the
breath work one because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terrence McKenna had a hilarious quote on
breath work because he was talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And someone was like, well, you don't need
to take those drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do that with your breath.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Terrence answered him, well,
that's all good and fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I take a psychedelic and I'm
tripping balls, I like to know I've taken
[SPEAKER_08]: a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that old Esselam Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also too, I've never done breath work to
the point where I did not exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been that high with breath
work, never.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you did take like 100 hits of acid.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also true, but there was no I,
I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to understand with Sam,
like he may sound abrasive and like he's
[SPEAKER_08]: coming off in a certain way, but he really
isn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: He really just wanted to know what
cannabinoid Josh was looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because for him, it's if you know him
well, he's very big promoter of THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: He always promoted, even when people were
using medical as a shield, when most of
[SPEAKER_08]: them weren't medical at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam was like, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to get high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will fight for people who want to get
high as hard as people are fighting for
[SPEAKER_08]: medical right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like why is either one less important than
the other?
[SPEAKER_08]: They both should be allowed.
[SPEAKER_10]: One reason why it's important to
acknowledge the medical aspect of it is
[SPEAKER_10]: because that's why we're having this
conversation right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get into this conversation
because everyone wanted to get high.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got into this conversation because it
gave medical relief to people that were in
[SPEAKER_10]: chronic illness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, but check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you find that out?
[SPEAKER_08]: How did we find that out?
[SPEAKER_08]: We found that out by getting high.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we found that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in acknowledgement of getting high.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't love weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get high all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It led us to that, the medicine component
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not saying either one is more
important than the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying they should always both be
respected and acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely agree medical is important
for the people who need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't know the definition of high.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the definition of high?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to ask, then I'm not sure it
could be explained to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this Logan.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've smoked a lot of hash and a lot of
cannabis in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember hearing our friend Rob tell
me about, Oh God, I was so high the other
[SPEAKER_08]: day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just couldn't even.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, that's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've never been that high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I, I would smoke as much as I could
get to the brink and still not be high
[SPEAKER_08]: enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just who I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I went and visited Sam for the
first time, I had a couple of pieces of
[SPEAKER_08]: humble pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now he didn't completely destroy me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't pass out or shit myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I thought for sure I was going to
because I was just so high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to know what high is,
it's like lit, like whoo, like a rocket
[SPEAKER_08]: ship flying through space.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: This man put a little bit of hash in the
bowl and I smoked it and it turned into
[SPEAKER_08]: water and glistened and bubbled and
melted.
[SPEAKER_08]: And before I had exhaled it, I was so
fucking high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to run out of my body.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, and I'm sitting and I'm trying to
like not lose my shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like someone I look up to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been invited into his very,
very, very tiny circle of people that he
[SPEAKER_08]: allows in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not trying to fuck that up,
but man, oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we smoked, I don't know,
20 more of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: He smoked for sure 60 more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I smoked probably 20 more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I left, like my two sides of my
body were like unplugged.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was walking like a weird Monty Python
walking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when we were at Legends?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Amsterdam here and Wally Duck came and
tried our really high quality dry set.
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed that pole and fell backwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He then, after we picked him up and
brought him over the table, passed out and
[SPEAKER_08]: set his hair on fire from a candle on the
table.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the Legends of Hash Parties,
you know that there's a perfect example of
[SPEAKER_08]: what is getting high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Legends of Hash, if you don't know about
it, it was a party that Sam and I started
[SPEAKER_08]: 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really, it was during the high
times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course Sam had been there since the
beginning and I showed up around 95,
[SPEAKER_08]: like six years later and I would go every
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would kind of realize like,
oh, this is kind of this commercial swaggy
[SPEAKER_08]: event, but it's all we've got.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's these amazing people here and
everyone's just promoting themselves and
[SPEAKER_08]: flyers and this bullshit and that
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were all kind of sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we thought, what if we started in a
little party that we hand chose 50 people
[SPEAKER_08]: based on their hash, not based on who they
are, based on their hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what the party was about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we couldn't bring cameras and we
couldn't be on your phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: You couldn't promote yourself in any way
and give away business cards and talk
[SPEAKER_08]: business.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, let's just spend a night
where we eat a beautiful meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: We drink some amazing juices and eat some
beautiful fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we smoke an insane amount of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and Sid would bring his beautiful
Afghani pipe, some of which were a hundred
[SPEAKER_08]: plus years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would smoke these hubbly bubblies
with like, with Sam's insane, like 60 to
[SPEAKER_08]: 70% pure dry sift, the shit that set me
off on a rocket ship.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's pouring a gram in the, in the...
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sometimes I put 10 grams in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'd never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really truly a night for
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would tell people who would be like,
Oh, I'm trying to get a ticket to Legends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if you don't want to smoke until
you're uncomfortably high, like you don't
[SPEAKER_08]: want to come to Legends because that's
really what that party was designed for
[SPEAKER_08]: and to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be my explanation of what
is getting high.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is getting high?
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting high is going to a Legends of hash
dinner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone that's ever been can attest,
you will be high and you won't have to
[SPEAKER_08]: question what it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say the Dragonfly Earth medicine
parties are pretty good too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we get together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus, I remember, I remember meeting
you, you're in a, in a, I guess it was
[SPEAKER_11]: 2010 at the High Times Candidates Cup,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I remember leaving one night,
it's like I'm hanging out with you and
[SPEAKER_11]: you're your buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and I've walked around the circle.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nam Square.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like so many times that I ran back into
your friends when they were leaving,
[SPEAKER_11]: like three hours later, they're like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm walking, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely am a big proponent of
medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, it is what finally took away
Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting high was never going to take away
Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: But medical definitely was the,
you know, and particularly, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: sick children.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like the last leg of Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the biggest douchebag Prohibitionists
couldn't really stand behind, like taking
[SPEAKER_08]: medication away from like little Charlotte
Fiji or whatever, you know, like how are
[SPEAKER_08]: you going to, how are you going to do
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that really, that cracked the door
that was never to be closed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was, that was the impossible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and here we are today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still not where we want to be,
but, but getting closer and closer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an Afghani hubbly bubbly right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's puffing tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me tell you, those Afghani dudes puff
tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not, if you think smoking chillums
in India or Nepal is like heavy duty
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are more intense than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like putting the chillum into a,
into a water pipe that has, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: a gallon of water in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it, it pulls quite a chub.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on, uh, speaking of Afghani,
it made me think of something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus, um, do you guys, is that a Texas
data time warp gone for yesteryear up
[SPEAKER_06]: there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the time warp still around?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, it's still around, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still on Texas data Island with some
of the more old school or dudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all sorts of crosses of it out
there, but the original Texas data time
[SPEAKER_08]: warp, which is just a super stretchy,
crazy, you know, tie cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that thing is, that thing definitely
exists.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's around and, and, and it's not
as hard to find as you'd think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if you've got knowledge, you go to,
you just go to Texas data Island.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't be long before you meet someone
and you say words and they hear those
[SPEAKER_08]: words and then you'll be at like some old
school dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can help you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just be like at rainbow's house or
whatever and be like, dude, I met rainbow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I was in his greenhouse where he gave
me a cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave me a cut in a golden pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was one of my favorite strains
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was an Afghani because I got,
I had a friend from Southern humble and
[SPEAKER_06]: she had a pile of old Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, and, and, um, once in a while you
get, you get some, some of the plants were
[SPEAKER_06]: really similar to what I remember time
we're being like.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what, what year did you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'd say all through the nineties,
like maybe 90 mid nineties to around 2000.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, then I just, it just seemed
like it, um, obviously well early
[SPEAKER_06]: nineties, I think, uh, I grew,
I was growing up on Vancouver Island and
[SPEAKER_06]: we were growing mostly time warp and,
uh, and that was just a rock and strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where on Vancouver Island were you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in Souk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like probably the worst place in
North America to learn how to grow outdoor
[SPEAKER_06]: weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like right off the, off the muck
coming off the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the first year we had really into the
summer beginner's look.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think the second year,
um, uh, I remember I didn't, from October
[SPEAKER_06]: 1st until on, I don't think I saw the
color blue in the sky till the following
[SPEAKER_06]: spring and it was rough, but that was,
that was a pretty resistant strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to grow it down here because I
know it would be well here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you got Josh offering right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can hook you up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if we can get back into the U S
and back into Canada again, cause that's
[SPEAKER_10]: the current issue at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the border is still closed,
huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we could go to the U S no problem,
but we can't come back into Canada without
[SPEAKER_10]: contact tracing and a two week quarantine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just don't want to, you know,
I don't want to do any of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't, doesn't sound right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't need that kind of scrutiny and
all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just stay out in the woods out here far
away, growing all these insane varietals
[SPEAKER_10]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, our greenhouse, the plants are
about six or seven nodes high right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about three, two to three
feet all from seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have the fattest stocks on all the
plants right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the most like crazy leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not having used any teas yet this
year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, we're just going on the
incredible soil building we've been doing
[SPEAKER_10]: over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the health is just amazing right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, we're starting to get some
incredible branching coming off the plants
[SPEAKER_10]: right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd say in a couple weeks, we're
probably going to start our first light
[SPEAKER_10]: debt, but it's cold here right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still in the mid sixties,
you know, or seventies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we're in this like super cold front
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had an early hail yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cold here too and rainy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like it's my fault.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went and got my boat out of storage.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you make it rain in,
in your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you that don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the boat out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go put that ship back away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey Colin, you know, on another show,
I remember you talking about growing
[SPEAKER_10]: clones and in an indoor setting and then
seeing by the nutrient inputs or by the
[SPEAKER_10]: soil that you were getting more waxes on
your hash or less waxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and in you are noticing that,
uh, you know, the trichomes were different
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was wondering what were some of the
things maybe that you, that you found that
[SPEAKER_10]: that changed that and what were your,
what were your goals in the end?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's like three, we'll, we'll unpack
that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so it's, uh, so yeah, so basically
what I went through was trying to better
[SPEAKER_11]: understand the resin and how it was
growing and environmental changes that
[SPEAKER_11]: affected it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so essentially, I started looking at
basically your, you know, the vapor
[SPEAKER_11]: density in the room, the, you know,
the AVD.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, so that informed a lot of my
decisions on like keeping the,
[SPEAKER_11]: the humidity a little bit higher during
veg and then understanding that if you
[SPEAKER_11]: dried things out, the wax membranes on
the, on the leaves would dry out and that
[SPEAKER_11]: would leave the plant vulnerable to
disease and to fungi and to all these
[SPEAKER_11]: different, uh, topical things that could
happen, but try to set forms in the flower
[SPEAKER_11]: itself, which then can, can actually,
now we know it can actually become
[SPEAKER_11]: systemic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, and that's actually been
confirmed, which is interesting,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, for all you home growers out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do get protritus on your beloved
plants, just be careful and know that that
[SPEAKER_11]: is going to most likely be with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's QPCR tests that you can get out
there that are fairly cheap.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can test all your plants and get,
uh, really accurate results very quickly
[SPEAKER_11]: for all of you guys out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That are, um, trying to do, trying to
better understand your environment and the
[SPEAKER_11]: clones that you might have.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the other thing is, is
understanding how healthy your plants are
[SPEAKER_11]: actually, you know, that was another thing
that I started to get into.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really about understanding the
environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went from, uh, very, very humid
seventies, eighties, and then dropping
[SPEAKER_11]: that humidity and understanding where to
drop the humidity for certain varietals or
[SPEAKER_11]: certain cultivars as you will.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and what I saw is that during the more
humid environments all the way through
[SPEAKER_11]: flower, I had much better resin that was
more tacky and a lot stronger.
[SPEAKER_11]: And under the loop, the, it was a lot more
uniform and under drier conditions,
[SPEAKER_11]: I had more, a lot more stacked trichomes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could see it was all kind of like
jumbling up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you touched it, they'd all kind
of hit each hit each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that was the biggest thing that I
learned through doing those, those,
[SPEAKER_11]: those trials.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then medium itself affected all of
that as well, where I felt like soil
[SPEAKER_11]: honestly, um, was a lot more, uh,
conducive to a higher resin count itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: It felt, and this is, you know,
all based off of photography and anecdotal
[SPEAKER_11]: for all of you people out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to sound, you know,
pretend like there's, there's,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a university study behind this,
but, um, what I found was, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, you growing in cocoa produced a
lot larger biomass, but it didn't follow
[SPEAKER_11]: suit with my resin and where soil produced
a lot of biomass, not as much maybe as
[SPEAKER_11]: the, as my, uh, you know, my cocoa medium
did, but it's still, it produced a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: more desirable, um, resin on the actual
flower itself that I could then actually
[SPEAKER_11]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that was really what,
you know, I learned from doing that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I, I personally, I think that it
depends on your application in which
[SPEAKER_11]: you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the hurdles in which you're
growing in 50,000 square feet versus 400
[SPEAKER_11]: square feet and everything in between
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, um, are you, is your
environment, are you, are you having to
[SPEAKER_11]: create an artificial environment?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then how does that reflect your medium
choice?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a big fan of going directly in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot of value to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The connection to the, to the soil is a
big deal and amendments and understanding
[SPEAKER_11]: how to play within the natural ecosystem
is a, as you know, you're an expert in
[SPEAKER_11]: that, um, you know, something that is
really what the plant desires,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and it's a lot easier to, uh,
grow at scale in my opinion, when,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, those environmental factors are
working in your favor and you're not
[SPEAKER_11]: having to tune them, uh, and then the H of
X system may break, but it all depends on
[SPEAKER_11]: what your application is, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: So indoor can be great, outdoor can be
great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but it's, you know, you've got to have
the, the understanding of your,
[SPEAKER_11]: of your environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, your cultivars that you're putting in
that set environment are also very
[SPEAKER_11]: important.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then your inputs for that set
environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: So terpene levels, um, you know,
they, honestly, I think for me,
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene levels are higher on, in a,
in a greenhouse setting than they are in
indoor.
[SPEAKER_11]: indoor setting for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, however, but medium to medium,
I see very little difference in less like
[SPEAKER_11]: from cocoa to from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if I go to rock wall for some reason,
it's, it feels a bit less, less in terms
[SPEAKER_11]: of the lab results.
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically the lab results tell that story.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and I really let that stuff drive.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't try to have too much of an opinion
other than, um, trying to search for the
[SPEAKER_11]: answer.
[SPEAKER_11]: If that, if you, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's super, that's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think about shade grown?
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone considering shade grown cannabis
even, um, for the aspect of hash even or
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene influence on the hash where,
I mean, seemingly like the worms are more
[SPEAKER_12]: alive, the compost dead fall from the
trees and stack up for humus is more
[SPEAKER_12]: active underneath a shade line.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tree layer, especially exposing itself to
the right exposure from East to West
[SPEAKER_12]: facing South and bleed in of sunlight,
perhaps like very location based shade
[SPEAKER_12]: grown for hash production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can grow really high quality
of shade, but your yields will be
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly less.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tied by side depots last year and they
tarped one and we didn't shape tarp the
[SPEAKER_00]: one right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of them had tropical truffle in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yield was less, not significant
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was within a couple pounds in the
big picture, but the terpene was far
[SPEAKER_00]: better in the shade tarp, far better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was notably different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could literally put too much from each
on a table and see the difference too in
[SPEAKER_00]: the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was a little bit less speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went, you know, in the way that they
hashed out, they both, they both bled
[SPEAKER_00]: about the same, um, for yield as far as
that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, uh, the terpene was higher in the
shade tarp.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's been our experience too,
going to farms, you know, different places
[SPEAKER_10]: is that if you have like Paul in your
area, you know, where it gets scorching
[SPEAKER_10]: hot Southern Oregon, you know,
110 all summer long, it feels like there
[SPEAKER_10]: is a lot of, um, automatic greenhouses
that have shade cloths that come for even
[SPEAKER_10]: two to three hours in the middle of the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's in an automatic setting
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I, I personally,
I would never use any shade cloth up here
[SPEAKER_10]: because I barely have any sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels like, you know, so I'm going to
take all the sun I can get, but I think it
[SPEAKER_10]: really matters on your environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder in Maine, you know, how exposed
you are to where you would necessarily
[SPEAKER_10]: really need that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if what Paul's saying, you know,
I mean, I would go for the shade cloth in
[SPEAKER_10]: an exposed area if it gave me better
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause ultimately we do it for the terps as
well as the medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be nice to see that experiment that
Paul did in some different regions.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 106, 107 for multiple weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know cooling it down,
they definitely looked happier in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely preserved terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like, so that's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: So many.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it, I think it probably helps
blocks the soil to, you know, keeps the
[SPEAKER_10]: soil more moist and more active.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would imagine the roots are a lot
happier too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Hey Paul, you, you've been doing a lot
of more natural farming practices on the
[SPEAKER_10]: farm and really adding even more attention
to your, to your beds and, and doing a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of that work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was wondering, are you noticing a
difference in your vegetative growth this
[SPEAKER_10]: year?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the stalks thicker in everything
that we've got, but the, the smell of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt is really changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everywhere you dig in,
we've got earthworms, we've got activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really doing a lot with,
we're playing with the IMOs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this beginning of the season into last
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't believe how quickly things
have been making, making a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_11]: So is anyone, is there any inputs that
anyone's been using in terms of a cover
[SPEAKER_11]: crop that, that they're finding that are,
that are exciting that they haven't used
[SPEAKER_11]: before this year?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone that's, you know,
maybe Josh, you can speak on some of this,
[SPEAKER_11]: but you know, I, I'm, I use the same
things over and over.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there, is there anything new that,
that anyone's been, been explained,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, exploring or kind of playing
around with in terms of a cover crop and.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think it really depends.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could let, you know, Logan and Dave
answer as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, my R2 census is up in this
Northern area.
[SPEAKER_10]: The winter rye has been an amazing friend
to us this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know the Sudanese sorghum grass is
an incredible biomass.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and it also, you know, in an indoor
setting, you know, the cover crop does a
[SPEAKER_10]: little different things, but on an,
in a greenhouse or an environment outdoors
[SPEAKER_10]: where you don't have ganja growing,
the cover crop can keep mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_10]: growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sudanese sorghum grass is one of the
best, you know, hosts for mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_10]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_10]: So part of the cover crops, you know,
thing is the stomata eats the air and
[SPEAKER_10]: farms the air, you know, puts it,
putting it into the roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other thing is the fact that
it's, you know, the green manure so I feel
[SPEAKER_10]: like having clover, it can be really good,
but at times it can also get the powdery
[SPEAKER_10]: mildew can come in on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it matters.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, we mulch is life for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now we just got done putting all
of our winter rye down and it's incredible
[SPEAKER_10]: how much it's in our case, this winter rye
grows up to be incredible grass.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just so easy to pull up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you see the roots on it,
they're just white and supple.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just look so incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you just realize, oh wow, you don't
really need to bring anything in when you
[SPEAKER_10]: have a really healthy cover crop,
but you can't really do heavy mulch and
[SPEAKER_10]: cover crop so well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes you just fold the cover crop
over and it revedges.
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now I just feel like more than
anything, it's covered the dirt and the
[SPEAKER_10]: mulch is the magic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the mulch love and really diversity,
you know, buckwheat, buckwheat is an
[SPEAKER_10]: amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very supple and really nice to roll
over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are some that come to mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave or anyone else have any thoughts on
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I use straw, local straw from the hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been, you know, for our field crops,
like for vegetables, we're a big fan of
[SPEAKER_06]: like a rye and a few legumes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We usually do like a field pea and a vetch
and a fava.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Josh was saying, the grass is,
you know, kind of help build the organic
[SPEAKER_06]: matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they really work well together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, we kind of try to
knock them in the ground about,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a good five weeks before we want
to plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have plenty of time to break down
and decompose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, anything that we're gonna
plant later in the season, we'd like them
[SPEAKER_06]: to go the distance and we just try to
knock them down before the seed becomes
[SPEAKER_06]: viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not creating more weed problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in ganja in particular, we've been a
really big fan of a New Zealand clover.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a white clover and really similar to
Dutch clover.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reason we like it, that variety in
particular, is it generally only grows to
[SPEAKER_06]: be about a foot tall, you know,
and it can handle foot traffic and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to get it into your aisles,
because, you know, we're just growing in
[SPEAKER_06]: hoop houses and native soil, but to plant
it into your aisles after your plants are
[SPEAKER_06]: established, it kind of creates a natural
mat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, your buds don't get all
dusty and dirt on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it also creates a lot of habitat
for beneficials and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we find that if you let it,
you know, we usually play on our second
[SPEAKER_06]: rounds, like our July rounds, after the
plants are big enough to not get choked
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you let the white clover in
particular go to flower before you turn in
[SPEAKER_06]: the following season, the spike in
nitrogen is richter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it's really impressive how much
nitrogen you get off of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the white clover.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been- Do you let it go to
flower?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you let it go to flower?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as much as we can, we let it go to
flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes if we have to get into
a hoop house and plant before it flowers,
[SPEAKER_06]: so be it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But generally that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it'll- Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we'll harvest late October and
then the following April, May is when it
[SPEAKER_06]: starts to flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good tip right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that it's really good to have
growing cover crop during the vegetative
[SPEAKER_10]: cycle and into the beginning part of the
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's really good to drop that
vegetation into a mulch towards the end of
[SPEAKER_10]: the flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that it's really kind of capping off
the top of the soil and keeping the
[SPEAKER_10]: moisture in and it's not creating any
static stagnant air.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then right as you're harvesting,
maybe a week or a few days before you
[SPEAKER_10]: harvest, you could reapply more cover crop
seed to where it's growing, just starting
[SPEAKER_10]: to grow as you're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that would kind of get you right
back into your vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're indoors or if you're in a
light depth or you're in a place where you
[SPEAKER_10]: could like kind of put another thing in
there, then you'd have the cover crop
[SPEAKER_10]: growing, which would keep the mycorrhizal
fungi and everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: The rhizosphere happening and then the new
plants would go in and eat the old roots.
Super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using beans to fix nitrogen in
your cover crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: We use fava beans as one of the beans we
grow for nitrogen.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just cuts down your fertilizer cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we definitely see our organic
matter levels rise from year to year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where we are on top of our game with
cover cropping, the nitrogen levels will
[SPEAKER_06]: increase from year to year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a ton of rain here in Oregon,
so a lot of that washes out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the hoop houses in particular,
the nitrogen levels, they build every year
[SPEAKER_06]: because you don't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, a huge amount of cannabis
will absolutely deplete nitrogen from soil
[SPEAKER_01]: if you grow it in that same spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, nitrogen is the easiest thing in
the world to create.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, anything that's green,
just melt it in the water and throw it
[SPEAKER_10]: over your plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's the same how much.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for me, nitrogen is like simple.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to create the carbon and to create
the organic matter which holds the fungi,
[SPEAKER_10]: which holds all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where the work is.
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, that's where the attention goes
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then using the aisles for us is like
the frontier.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything that we walk on is just fat
organic matter and over mulch the system.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you have big beds on the edge,
the edge of the beds and on the sides of
[SPEAKER_10]: the beds, just a large amount of mulch for
decomposing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're seeing a good eight to 12 inches
of new soil that we're folding onto our
[SPEAKER_10]: beds each year right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those aisles are just all of our new
soil for our beds each year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I recognize indoors, that's different
and everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if you make your beds right,
on the edge of the beds where it comes up,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can get a lot of mulch in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even you could dig out holes in your
indoor beds and pack those holes with food
[SPEAKER_10]: scraps and different kinds of straw for
mulch isn't necessarily the best because
[SPEAKER_10]: it doesn't have a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so straws is fine because it's carbon.
[SPEAKER_10]: But with mulch, you're really kind of
looking for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where like if you're mulching with
comfrey and nettles and grasses and tree
[SPEAKER_10]: leaves and all that, then you have this
crazy diversity with all the trace
[SPEAKER_10]: minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where the real magic comes
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Logan, I'll jump in and share something
about Hawaii real quick, because we're in
[SPEAKER_03]: like a continuous farm loop with the
cannabis in particular, where it's a year
[SPEAKER_03]: round farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really get a season off or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your soil is always eating and always
decomposing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like what Afa Josh was just saying,
a lot of more green material is what I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just real quickly, I drew this diagram
real quick just to show like a living soil
[SPEAKER_03]: bed with your cannabis planted in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've been doing is planting my
edges with comfrey, lemongrass,
[SPEAKER_03]: and taro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I'll do is that the comfrey
grows so fast, I'll just come through it
[SPEAKER_03]: when it starts to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you let some of it flower for the bees
and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But chop and drop that onto the beds just
constantly year round.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the lemongrass I'm adding on
there year round.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just always growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got on-site green waste to add to my
beds all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, I'm using lots of
this diverse cover crops, obviously your
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen fixers that are in there,
which would be my imported seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm trying to wean off of the imported
seed a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going more with seeds that are
more prolific in my area, which one of
[SPEAKER_03]: them is like this edible amaranth,
the callaloo from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one just keeps growing
prolifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can just keep chopping and dropping
it and reseeding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To add to that, one thing I do like to use
is daikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can keep daikon in your beds,
for some reason it grows great with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something going on with the
exudates or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these daikon, I'll come back through
and pull them out after they've been in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll harvest my cannabis and I'll
see some of them that survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you come back through and pull them
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're a couple of feet long,
12 to 24 inches long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them are decomposing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look through the middle of the
daikon root, it's like a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The outside is like a shell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the middle is like this rotting tunnel
of just microbial life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's from the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the top of the soil, that's going
straight in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like an air tunnel and a
microbial superhighway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just adding life deep down into
that middle and sublayer of your living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really love daikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same with the comfrey.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pull up a comfrey root to replant
it somewhere else, you see that rotting
[SPEAKER_03]: outside, kind of decomposing root has this
channel going deep into the soil of brown
[SPEAKER_03]: rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of decay, which you can just see is
like this bacterial superhighway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like Josh said, that nitrogen is just
heavily abundant if you're using that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing about the choice of
covering your soil, wood chips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed in cannabis, a lot of people,
it's kind of stray away from wood chips
[SPEAKER_03]: more than maybe they should.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just started using a lot more wood
chips recently with great results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mixing actually like a hard wood with
more of like a green wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on a coffee farm, so we chip the
coffee boughs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just in one day of leaving a pile
of coffee chips, you'll see this white
[SPEAKER_03]: mycelium running through it within 24 to
48 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just you can go back and open up the
pile of this because it's a soft green
[SPEAKER_03]: wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just this living mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that mixed with the native ohia wood
chips, which are more of a hardwood,
[SPEAKER_03]: have created this whole other layer of
life that I've haven't seen on my living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil beds that are like 10 years old at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of those kind of tips and tricks,
I would definitely employ the daikon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these deep drilling root
vegetables maybe, or deep drilling things
[SPEAKER_03]: like your clovers and your you know,
your country and having a nearby because
[SPEAKER_03]: Rudolph Steiner said, Rudolph Steiner said
only a sick farm needs outside inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is your farm sick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is your farm sick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is your farm healthy?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not speaking for a farm that's
just starting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you might need to bring
something in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're living on an established
farm, and you're planning on being there
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time, only a sick farm needs
outside inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what my quote, that's Rudolph
Steiner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, good tips and tricks there for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's good information.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to be knowing these things from
people who have actually done it.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I would say about the wood chips
too, at least here in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_08]: Northwest, cyanescent mushrooms just love
wood chips.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really, really love wood chips.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here in West Vancouver, close to where
I live, they just wood chipped every
[SPEAKER_08]: boulevard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then put grass over top of the wood
chip.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all of our boulevards are basically
wood chips.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see cyanescent mushrooms,
generally around October, November,
[SPEAKER_08]: just popping out all over the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can find them even driving in your car
by looking for a much larger honey
[SPEAKER_08]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: That if you spot those out of the corner
of your eye, you can pull over and like
[SPEAKER_08]: I've literally searched for cyanescent
mushrooms in my vehicle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how ridiculous is that every time
I've had to, and you can see them in
[SPEAKER_08]: Vancouver as well, but they're similar in
Seattle, Liberty Caps.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go towards the Vancouver airport on
the right, there's this big field of
[SPEAKER_08]: grass.
[SPEAKER_08]: During those months in particular,
you'll see people walking with golf clubs.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not golfing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are picking psychedelic mushrooms and
good on them for doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was a big issue in Olymp,
from Olympia up to through Seattle was
[SPEAKER_10]: like evergreen state college was,
is, was they mowed all the trees down and
[SPEAKER_10]: chopped off and chipped all the trees and
then put grass over it and then built the
[SPEAKER_10]: college.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everywhere around the college,
when Paul Stamets was going to college
[SPEAKER_10]: there and everything like cyanescence were
just part of the campus.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they started using, like you
said, wood chips all over Seattle in
[SPEAKER_10]: landscaping.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just basically like put wood
chips out and they will come.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and then sadly they started using a
lot of fungicides in the municipal wood
[SPEAKER_10]: chips.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they started using a lot of
different type areas to stop like the
[SPEAKER_10]: spread of the psychedelic fungi and
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is really good for people to,
when they find a big fat patch is they
[SPEAKER_10]: could grab a little bit of that mycelium
and bring it back to their land along with
[SPEAKER_10]: fresh wood chips and then grow that,
growing that on their land.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good for the forest and it's good to
have that growing on your property,
[SPEAKER_10]: little wild patches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gently, you know, we had a house that we
were growing in years ago and my partner
[SPEAKER_08]: called me up in a, in a flurry and he was
like, he's like, there's this dreddy guy
[SPEAKER_08]: and he's picking something out of our,
out of our front driveway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're paranoid at this time.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not really allowed to be growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're just like, is this dreddy guy
like a, like a, like an undercover agent
[SPEAKER_08]: or something?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's the mentality you're thinking
when it's super illegal and you can get in
[SPEAKER_08]: mad trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turns out he's picking all the mushrooms
that are growing on our, we have this like
[SPEAKER_08]: insane flush of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Buddy took a giant bag of,
of cyanescence out of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we used it for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one year I was, I was, I went to go
there to pick just a few mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my ex partner was there literally
digging up the entire mycelia bed with a
[SPEAKER_08]: shovel to take it away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like, dude, like talk about a
faux pas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a little, but don't take a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to the mycelia, when it
comes to the mushroom, take a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take a little.
[SPEAKER_10]: You shouldn't be able to see where you
took it from afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could take a handful and make it grow
from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can't make it work with a handful,
you shouldn't be taking it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two vibrations in this world,
fear and scarcity and love and abundance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_08]: They get trapped in the fear and scarcity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it definitely does make them do,
strange insecure things that you would
[SPEAKER_08]: just think like, you know, there's enough
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget the biggest mantra of
mankind, greed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Greed is for real.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe just a little humility.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like weed instead of greed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I hear what he's saying though,
you know, the human race definitely has a
[SPEAKER_08]: problem with greed, probably because the
whole system is based on fear and
[SPEAKER_08]: scarcity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the whole design is just very
inaccurate and insanely wasteful and
[SPEAKER_08]: definitely not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably why we're in some sort of,
you know, I don't know, strange matrix
[SPEAKER_08]: like complex that's, that's just,
you know, we're just in some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't they say that fish in the oceans
have been reduced by 75%?
[SPEAKER_08]: That we've reduced fish by 75%?
[SPEAKER_08]: Man did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the one that disturbed me the most
was that, and it was a freaky one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, it was about the mammalian
mass on planet earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was from David Attenborough,
the guy that did the earth series,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, David.
[SPEAKER_08]: He, he said something, oh, it was to the
tune of, it was like 77% of all bird life
[SPEAKER_08]: on earth are chickens in like
commercialized chickens.
[SPEAKER_08]: 77% of the birds in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was a more, it was even a more
disturbing world word for, for the
[SPEAKER_08]: mammalian mass.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like cows and pigs and they made up
this like, they made up like 96% of
[SPEAKER_08]: mammalian mass along with humans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like zebras and giraffes and
lions and shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like 4% of what was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably make up half the percent of
all the 4%.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of depressing in a way of
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, well, we could probably do
better than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I, I, I'm pretty sure we can do
better than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just need to let go of some of these
old systems and come up with some very new
[SPEAKER_08]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hear a statistic like that,
it should just ring a bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about what you eat and what you
consume and what you participate in every
[SPEAKER_03]: day, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's big time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very accurate.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, very accurate.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the systems that you are
supporting knowingly?
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the first ones you try to work
through and nobody's saying it's easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, as long as you're working
through getting, you know, those cut down
[SPEAKER_08]: to eliminate it eventually, then the,
then the unconscious ones are there,
[SPEAKER_08]: which are the really frightening ones
because that's how the whole system works.
[SPEAKER_08]: It, it avoids even conscious human beings
and gets you in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's quite, quite a shitsum as
Peter Tosh would always call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought that was a very perfect,
perfect term for the entire, for the
[SPEAKER_08]: entire thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once more, cannabis and psychedelics have
helped me see through these things in a
[SPEAKER_08]: way that I honestly don't think I ever
would have had I not had those,
[SPEAKER_08]: those in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel blessed for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But everyone else was abusing alcohol when
they were younger and my age and a dab
[SPEAKER_08]: fell out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kobe right into the bowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks sweet, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very buttery.
[SPEAKER_08]: That like some rosin that you pressed some
hash out of, or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's whole plant, fresh, frozen,
um, some papaya whole plant, fresh,
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen, rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: That papaya is nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in Jamaica and my friend was telling
me about the Emerald cup and he was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, straight organics won the solvent list
with his papaya or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, Oh man, I'm like,
don't be telling me about hash that I
[SPEAKER_08]: can't have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the winning one from straight
organics cracks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives me a big dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like, dude, that is the most
amazing flavor that whatever papaya cut he
[SPEAKER_08]: has tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Papaya is so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of my favorite fruity,
perfumey, gassy honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just top ranking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a different category.
[SPEAKER_11]: Honey seeds makes that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can, I think you can find your,
your keeper out of the, out of his
[SPEAKER_11]: varieties that, you know, I think he's a
good breeder and really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chop a can of cookies is another good one
from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow real papayas in Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we grow many varieties of papayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have much trouble with fruit flies?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were growing them in Kauai,
we had to keep them the inside of screened
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses because papaya, the fruit
flies hit every single papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they weren't protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, not the papayas and the fruit
flies aren't an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this ring spot virus that's out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's floating around on the island.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some kind of, I don't know,
I bet it's manmade.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What spreads ring spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the insect vector?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the vector myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but that's the reason why they created
the GMO papaya, which is like the main
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow on the east side of the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of what they grow in Hawaii is GMO
papayas, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's due to the ring spot virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so yeah, you got to really
question what's going on with your farming
[SPEAKER_03]: practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're dealing with some kind of,
you know, island wide virus, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, what happened there?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they call it anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican fruit flies made it really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until finally we just grew the papayas
inside of a netted shade crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that stopped them from cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting because we don't have
that issue at all with the, with anything
[SPEAKER_03]: tropical.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we try to grow like a European
vegetable, like something like a squash or
[SPEAKER_03]: a melon or anything that's like,
some kind of more like a Northern European
[SPEAKER_03]: type thing, then you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was in the North Shore of
Kauai.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you heard us at a lower elevation or
at a certain, a certain humid area or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might have even been the time,
you know, but when was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the, the papayas are so
resilient, you know, they're a tropical
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything tropical, the bananas and
papayas, the taros, the sugar cane,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the sweet potato, anything
tropical, like you don't spray it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, you don't put anything on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you just kind of like maybe just
help build the soil and mulch things and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's, that's conducive to the
environment just grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when we talked about food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sovereignty in the last Dragonfly Earth
Medicine talk, it was all about just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, using food and things that grow
properly in your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of that netting and stuff like
that definitely comes with the European
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetables that are susceptible to that
fruit fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That fruit fly will stink the fruit and
they'll put their larvae in there and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The papayas did really good in Hawaii
until the Mexican fruit fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that was even maybe just like
a score.
[SPEAKER_03]: A certain time of the time of a history
that maybe we had like a scourge of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, they're still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no problems with fruit flies on the
papayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do, we do different varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Thai papaya, we got this Filipino pink
papaya, strawberry papayas, solo papayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got a good variety of papayas
to make for good ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you grown the ones from Thailand that
are orange?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, we got one called the red Thai
and it's got a really, really orange kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of pinkish flesh in there, you know,
and that's one of our better ones for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A ripe or even green and a papaya salad,
you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any pineapples down there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what actually my main fruit
is, or actually my main thing I bring to
[SPEAKER_03]: market would be my white pineapples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do anywhere from two to 5,000
pounds a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at probably this year,
we'll probably get more like three,
[SPEAKER_03]: two to 3,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the white pineapple man is this
strain called sugarloaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is so terpy and tasty and
sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we're kind of known for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the crown fruit, the king's
fruit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You grow any pineapple ganja spridles out
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have one that I call the white
pineapple in spirit of the white
[SPEAKER_03]: pineapples on the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of my really good hash
strains as well, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it puts up this really, you know,
floral, fruity, terpy hat that is really
[SPEAKER_03]: sought after too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it pretty obvious that you're using
your white pineapple fruit juice on your
[SPEAKER_10]: white pineapple ganja varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely do a few, a few ferments in
FPJs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mastercho said that the pineapple is a
little acidic for the FPJs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't use too much on the ganja
patch, but I have for sure in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll dose those pineapples in
particular.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe just around the edges or something
so the roots can kind of take a minute to
[SPEAKER_03]: break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, no, I'm not scared of nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, man, doing the natural farming
for so long, man, you just learn that that
[SPEAKER_03]: soil really could eat a lot unless you're
just really blowing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got a nice living soil that's just
really respirating and really just vibing
[SPEAKER_03]: out, you can't really do too much wrong to
it unless you're buying a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: imported weird things or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that are you on the wet
side or the dry side of the island?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're over here on the Kona side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So luckily we're on the dry side,
even though we've gotten what is it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 30 days of rain straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we're coming onto the rainy season,
so the cannabis definitely is not loving
[SPEAKER_03]: that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the tropics and it's rainy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like that double dose.
[SPEAKER_10]: You almost have to grow the tropical land
racy varieties during that season.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I wanted to get into.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys were talking about,
I think Colin was talking about just the
[SPEAKER_03]: different, you know, climates and how they
are affecting the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_03]: waxiness of the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That got me thinking while you guys were
talking was, has anybody ever thought of
[SPEAKER_03]: this or done these experiments where it
would be like you take an Afghani hash
[SPEAKER_03]: strain and you grow it in a, I mean,
if you had a controlled greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: you dry, you know, you make it a dry
desert environment and you try to mimic
[SPEAKER_03]: that Afghani kind of high mountain desert
climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you had a tropical land racy strain,
you try to up the humidity and try to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of mimic the nature because in natural
farming, what we're doing, like the main
[SPEAKER_03]: teaching is mimic nature and bring nature
into your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if you actually went down to the
genetics of where your plant came from on
[SPEAKER_03]: the planet and mimic that nature in a
controlled environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow in greenhouses outdoor and I love
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe you grew an Afghani hash strain
in a high desert mountain climate mimicked
[SPEAKER_03]: in your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that goes back to the whole idea
of terroir and Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Sam has the most experience in all
of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to hear your thoughts,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the one thing I can say is that
widely from Afghanistan, Pakistan and the
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding area, which were developed for
hashish, they have no natural resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: to botrytis and mildew and these kinds of
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a real problem to grow them
in a wet, humid environment like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: North Shore of Kauai or anyplace else
where it's really, they just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas varieties from Thailand or
Colombia, those places, those are from
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, moist, tropical environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they didn't have resistance,
they wouldn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my question is more just for you
guys that have a way to control your
[SPEAKER_03]: environment and just for the purpose of
talking hash production in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be able to tease your climate to
better mask the genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where I'm going with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Colin understood what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, most widely varieties,
indicas or what people call them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't really have the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got lots of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't criticize them for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got lots of resin, but they don't
have the terpenes the way that ganja
[SPEAKER_01]: smokers have conserved and preserved and
created varieties like Thailand,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia, et cetera, et cetera,
that are really, I mean, no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: much THC you have, without the right
terpenes, it doesn't cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to keep the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I agree with Sam 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to answer the question of the
environmental stuff, for the hybrids that
[SPEAKER_11]: I grow, absolutely everything's kind of
catered to that for resin production.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'm growing a variety, it's all about
how I'm catering to that variety or group
[SPEAKER_11]: of varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I try to group things together that
are kind of related to one another based
[SPEAKER_11]: on region.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do look at where those varieties
come from, from a progeny standpoint
[SPEAKER_11]: standpoint to make sure that if I'm
putting motor breath 15 in there with sour
[SPEAKER_11]: D and chem dog D, they're all going to
play nice with my feeding and I don't have
[SPEAKER_11]: to do too much work.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I try to keep things, I try to think
like that in terms of what my end goal is,
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's all about hash for what I'm
producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can give you a good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a greenhouse where I was doing
trialing of imported seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan year after year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one year I had a couple thousand of
them growing in there, but I'd also grown
[SPEAKER_01]: a few original Hayes plants in the middle
of the greenhouse in between the rows of
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the Afghan plants got mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was this one year, it was
really, really bad, both the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and the seed variety itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had Hayes growing in the middle of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a darkening system, so they were
flowering along with the Afghans.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Afghans were more flowering along,
but the Hayes didn't have one spot of
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew on it, none of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of the Afghans were quite
literally dripping mildew white crap off
[SPEAKER_01]: their fucking leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can't fight mother nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to use Afghan varieties,
then you better breed it in such a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that none of those non-resistant
varieties, genes for botrytis and mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: are in them, because you're just fighting
mother nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you should do instead is grow things
like Hayes or other tropical narrowleaf
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, which have no trouble growing
mildew and botrytis free, even if your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse is a bit hot or humid.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brian, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: What varieties are you growing up there
that are dealing with all that we have to
[SPEAKER_11]: deal with on the East Coast?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when hurricane season starts to
kick up, then the storms start to come.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm kind of following what Sam is
saying for a while now with selecting the
[SPEAKER_12]: right cultivars that do well according to
the climate here.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when I was even in Northern
California, I didn't have the greatest
[SPEAKER_12]: exposure, so I had to deal with mold and
botrytis and mildew.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've had some genetics carry over,
like I mentioned last time, some strong
[SPEAKER_12]: strawberry fields, which is the strawberry
banana tangy from Crockett, that I cross
[SPEAKER_12]: to my angel food cake, which is kind of a
deep poly strain, very poly hybrid strain
[SPEAKER_12]: I made.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I've carried over to here with
that one that's done very well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've made variations from strawberry angel
food now into strawberry angela,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is the strawberry angel food by
Testerosa.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm having great results outside with
that cross into the Testerosa.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Skittles magnum opus Skittles.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I'm seeing and even sensing in the
terpene profile on the strawberry angel
[SPEAKER_12]: food, particular cross to Testerosa I call
strawberry angela, that phenyl is a
[SPEAKER_12]: reminder of the grapey royal kush kind of
magnum opus thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm just getting great health results
with that type.
[SPEAKER_12]: 24 karat, I have one outside right now
that's a beast and super healthy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually find that sativa, equatorial
sativa input is what we kind of need here,
[SPEAKER_12]: even in domain.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's interesting, but it has to be
absolutely the right phenotype that's been
[SPEAKER_12]: selected.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that just basically takes you letting
it run.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like even out here, I'm year three of
selecting and I've got about, oh,
[SPEAKER_12]: three chosen types that I go back to after
three years of sour banana sherbet,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, that's just amazing comes off
early.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the late September on its own full
sun.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, otherwise I'm light depths.
[SPEAKER_12]: We just flipped a week ago on the first
session and I'm greenhouse grow,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I do both.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's about the cultivar about finding
that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that will shine for you indoor
greenhouse outside, even from into
[SPEAKER_12]: different regions,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to put in the work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Equatorial on the East coast is really
been successful for me over the years and
[SPEAKER_11]: last, you know, however long it's it's
something that I recommend anyone on the
[SPEAKER_11]: East coast to take a look at that's
growing outside.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm definitely sure Brian said to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you guys all agree that sometimes
your best genetic that grows for flower
[SPEAKER_03]: production and health and is that most
vibrant kind of like you were just saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you get you find that one that shines
and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for some reason, how come that one's
not really the hash producer?
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys find that I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, my strawberry angel food drips.
[SPEAKER_12]: My strawberry angel food drips turps.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got the juiciest flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been hitting low temp flower rosin
and getting this just buttery cream.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really drips even into the cross
out with the Tesserosa is still I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: getting at the same temperature white
chalk flower rosin that dumps pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's just not that terpene influence.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I don't get the best bubble hash
off it either.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: The pineapple fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come out as much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I find that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a strawberry really great variety
that gave lousy yield of dry sift because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always after dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the cutting edge is rosin,
but I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, your dry sift is untouchable,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget about old school, new school,
whatever school.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit is the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough said.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one thing that kind of circle
back to what Logan was talking about,
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of you guys might do this as
well, but we don't we don't try to create
[SPEAKER_06]: a I guess what you're asking about
specifically is any of us try to create an
[SPEAKER_06]: environment for specific cultivars that
kind of mimics their natural environment
[SPEAKER_06]: where they're native to.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one thing that we do is we have a
pretty good climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stays like in the 80s most of the
summer might spike in the low 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then inevitably we'll get one or two
spikes here usually June, July,
[SPEAKER_06]: August for anywhere from three days to
five days where we get a heat spell of 100
[SPEAKER_06]: degree plus days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ganja doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grows a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think during the three hours of super
hot weather, maybe from like 1 to 6 p.m.,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's kind of just like hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the rest, the other 20 hours of the
day, it's trucking along and growing a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we do, we don't have like high
tech like bells and whistles, climate
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled greenhouses, but we do have,
you know, roll up sides and a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: ventilation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we even bring in big fans and shade
cloth everything for those heat spells.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like anything that's like, you know,
three weeks or less from finishing,
[SPEAKER_06]: we definitely see that, you know,
they'll kind of do like that star fishing
[SPEAKER_06]: and the leaves will taco and the resin
count is not as good with that super heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the shade cloth really, you know,
we try to have enough shade cloth on hand
[SPEAKER_06]: so that we can, you know, sort of beat the
heat with all those houses and cool down a
[SPEAKER_06]: good 15, 20 degrees in the house from
outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one technique we do here that works
really good because we have almost three
[SPEAKER_06]: and a half acres in hoop houses between
our ganja and our vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since you only need that shade cloth
for maybe once or twice a year,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a pretty big investment and more
materials and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing we like doing here, we call it
the poor man shade cloth, where you get a
[SPEAKER_06]: heat spell and you know, either your
tomatoes or your ganja is like in that
[SPEAKER_06]: crunch time where it's going to be
suffering a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just take buckets of mud and toss it
over the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that works great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It cools it down just the same as shade
cloth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, sometimes we'll be
lazy about it and let the rain wash it
[SPEAKER_06]: off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise we'll just, you know,
get up on a tractor and wash it off after
[SPEAKER_06]: the heat spell goes through.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, between the side walls and
the end walls and fans and shade cloth,
[SPEAKER_06]: just with the elbow grease, you know,
that's kind of like our low tech climate
[SPEAKER_06]: control that really helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I used in the Netherlands was,
an organic white chalk-like material that
[SPEAKER_01]: you sprayed on the outside of the glass
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had a greenhouse that was about
20 feet tall and it was about an acre
[SPEAKER_01]: under glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every May, or early May, I would spray
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the kind that after a couple of
really good hard rains, it would start to
[SPEAKER_01]: wash off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by the end of the year,
it was pretty much gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd spray it every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would knock the temperature,
internal temperature down at least 10
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never saw any negative effects in
yield, quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I find cannabis, like all of you
agree, if it's grown too hot, veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it can take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But flowering is not good for flowering
cannabis, excess heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then how the hell did that bubble that was
made in Jamaica back in the day when we
[SPEAKER_08]: were there together, that was just
beautiful, big clear domes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the doctor he grew with?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, how, because I was always thinking
about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, it was so insanely hot up on the
top of that little mountain where he's
[SPEAKER_08]: growing that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like, like the sun,
it was just always like melting the resin
[SPEAKER_08]: glands off of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought I was like, I don't know
how you could have, like how the hell does
[SPEAKER_09]: he have that many?
[SPEAKER_09]: Does everybody else hear him?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you broke up and the connection went
bad for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wondered how you could grow such
great herb in Jamaica in the, in the
[SPEAKER_08]: insanely intense heat, like nonstop from
morning, noon till night and produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're not comparing it to,
Marcus, is what would the same cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: had been grown if it was 10 degrees
cooler?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where I grew in Santa Cruz,
we always had ocean fogs in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much cooler than central
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell you, the cannabis liked it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's what I'm thinking though.
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point in time, I don't think I'd
ever seen you smoke anything from anyone
[SPEAKER_08]: ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just only smoked your own,
but you smoked that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, wow, this has to be really
good hash for him to be like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running out of the hash I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was still pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we probably had some, if not the best,
some of the best smoke in Jamaica on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole fucking island.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I would go without a shadow of a doubt
and say that was accurate, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because still to this day, when I go back
there and I make full melt bubble from
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamaican cultivars, and then I go around
mostly to the steamers, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the chalice steamers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple of friends that own
steamer companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Caleb is on one side of the island and
then Kevin has a steam team, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those things with the coals burning in
the coochie.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the first time I tried to
put something on top, they were kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: like, whoa, no, man, we just steam.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, no, no, you're going to steam
this, but it's going to steam a little
[SPEAKER_08]: differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just dropping big dabs on the coals
while hitting like a really exotic sativa
[SPEAKER_08]: underneath while at a reggae show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in Jamaica, I'm just like,
this is it for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this is the pinnacle of my life's
experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just good.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't done it, I implore you all
to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, we should all do it together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to Jamaica, enjoy some good
reggae and good food and great people and
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best place to listen to music in
Jamaica, of course, is a yard concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: For real.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the best yard, in my opinion,
I was brought there by Kidis Eye and it
[SPEAKER_08]: was Earl Chinna Smith's yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the most musical dude on the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people who gravitate to Chinna's
place is really like seriously an
[SPEAKER_08]: unbelievable experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, bubble man, you get the treatment
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going with you next time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude, we will go.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, man, I'm going to Chinna's yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the Inn of the Yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Inn of the Yard is another really good
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of amazing yards in
Kingston that are that are just next
[SPEAKER_08]: level.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't matter where you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're with Kidis Eye, like he is just
the most incredible, awesome individual,
[SPEAKER_08]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could listen to him tell stories all day
long.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't heard of him, Google him
and learn some of his music.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go on bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Jamaican episodes where he plays,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduation from Zion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduation from Zion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kidis Eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legendary tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legendary artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up Kidis Eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got I was dabbing at a stepping high
festival put on by Carlene and what is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I don't want to get his name wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, great people.
[SPEAKER_08]: They put on Stepping High Festival in
Negril.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been going on for like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: 14 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one year I showed up and had a booth
and I got to judge it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was with Kidis the whole time and I
was sort of filming as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at one point he was at the booth and
he's like he's just he's just always
[SPEAKER_08]: looked so cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just kind of leans over and takes a
dab out of the fab bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's just like 78 years old or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just like hits this huge dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has a huge joint in his finger while he's
hitting the dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then someone's like, Kidis,
you're next.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're next.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I film.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm filming him take a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then this guy says, you're next.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he's like, he's like, I got to go
perform and sort of starts to walk away
[SPEAKER_08]: and he walks through the crowd and it's
very dark and there's lights in the
[SPEAKER_08]: background from the stage and he's just
walking through the smoke, passes the
[SPEAKER_08]: police.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's like, Kidis, Kidis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yelling to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's straight out of a movie.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should try and find it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's called Ganja Baby,
because then I follow him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He walks super slow all the way to the end
backstage, up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: The band quits playing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He grabs the mic and starts performing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like Nyabingi drummers are in the
front with a bunch of cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_08]: right all in the front of the stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just it was one of my all time most
favorite moments in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the my favorite thing I've ever
filmed on my channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's got like two or three thousand
hits like it's absolutely go hit that shit
[SPEAKER_07]: up and find it because it's worth checking
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something I wanted to add into
about the you're talking about the the
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble hash and that heat, you know,
or that that plant growing in the heat up
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown, you know, a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and grew in different climates in
NorCal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've grown here my whole life in
Hawaii as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just something there's
something going on with with the
[SPEAKER_03]: equatorial region that you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I mean by that is, you know,
obviously the tropics and the dry desert
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that or the northern climates or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's something about that that
tropic equatorial.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something about the way the sun
shines, the angles and the degrees that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're getting this, you know,
it's, you know, the diff obviously like
[SPEAKER_03]: like Hemp Guy was talking about the
different you know, terpene profiles of
[SPEAKER_03]: the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting way more of this fruity
floral thing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, in those drier
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you know, I've just noticed
that growing in Hawaii in particular,
[SPEAKER_03]: every every cultivar that I've grown here
and that I've grown in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones in Hawaii express way more
terpenes, way more of a of a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not to say anything's better or worse
than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a beautiful plant in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something about the tropics,
you know, and that might be the answer to
[SPEAKER_03]: your question, I think, Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_08]: Word.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at what I found.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Kittis taking out my table while
he's smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, OK, yeah, let me take my joint
out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll smoke the mothership real quick here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no sound, but you can go check it
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ganja Baby, Kittis Eye and the
Innityard Drummers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's got like 2000 views,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe this video should have so
many more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's hitting the Taurus too,
not the egg.
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was years ago, 2015, five years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kittis, champion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Strongest man, most amazing individual.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely a key person to bump into if
you go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone, everyone knows him.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't muted, not for really any
reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I could.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm walking backstage with Kittis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going backstage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't left that table since I've been
here.
