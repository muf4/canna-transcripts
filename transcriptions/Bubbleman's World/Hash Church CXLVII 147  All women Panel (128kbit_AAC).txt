[SPEAKER_16]: Well, hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 147.
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Dr. Natasha Riz and I will be
replacing Marcus today to host Hash
[SPEAKER_16]: Church.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm gonna send out the link and get in
our panel members.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just sending out the link.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully that worked.
[SPEAKER_16]: Should be getting some ladies joining us
shortly.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I haven't been on the Hash Church panel
for the last few weeks or months,
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been out traveling and actually doing
the conference circuit.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I've been lucky enough to attend a
few different conferences and hang out
[SPEAKER_16]: with a lot of experts in the cannabis
realm.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was recently at ICRS, which is the
International Cannabinoid Research
[SPEAKER_16]: Society.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they had a really nice meeting in
Montreal at the end of July.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I presented a poster and an
abstract that was a case report about
[SPEAKER_16]: pediatric Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what happened with this patient is
they were unresponsive to a lot of
[SPEAKER_16]: different traditional therapies for
Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so what Crohn's disease, it's a form
of inflammatory bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is different than other gut
conditions because what happens with these
[SPEAKER_16]: patients is they get severe inflammation
all throughout their gastrointestinal
[SPEAKER_16]: tract.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this results in ulceration and it can
also result in damage to the gut resulting
[SPEAKER_16]: in basically wounds, even sometimes the
wound can go all the way through the gut
[SPEAKER_16]: and can actually cause damage.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, here's our first panelist in the room.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just want to give you a little brief
introduction.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Sarah Russo joining us from
Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's the creative director.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sarah's joining us from Spain this
morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: So hi, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and Marcia just joined us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Marcia Gilman.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us also.
[SPEAKER_16]: Popping in this morning bright and early.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also in the room is Sarah Russo from
Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I actually want to start off the
conversation with Sarah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So she did all day something interesting
where she took a vow of silence yesterday.
[SPEAKER_16]: So she had no contact with social,
no speaking.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and we've got Hillary Black in the
room.
[SPEAKER_16]: So welcome, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_16]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we've got Andrea Herman.
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome, Andrea.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Sarah, tell us a little bit about your
day fast you just did yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday I decided to take a vow of
silence, which it's been a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: since I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically a vow of silence is what it
sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't speak for the whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time around, I decided to
completely detox from any technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't on the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually went to a half day
meditation retreat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like if I need any sort of
clarity or insight and my mind just feels
[SPEAKER_00]: bogged down anyway, taking a vow of
silence just kind of calms all that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're trying to figure out
answers to life's questions, it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: way to start because we get so caught up
in our thoughts and what we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: think and what we're going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a nice practice.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very neat.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very neat.
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have Nisha Whitley joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just popped into the room.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to bring it back to Hillary.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Hillary, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a nice little chat a few days ago
just talking about some ideas for today
[SPEAKER_16]: and catching up a little.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Hillary brought up a panel that had
previously happened with a group of you
[SPEAKER_16]: guys a few days ago just talking about
some ideas for today and catching up a
[SPEAKER_16]: little.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: Getting some feedback.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're not speaking, please just put
your microphone.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome, Selena.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us also.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I just wanted to bring it back to
Dr. Marcia Gelman and also Hillary Black.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys did a panel that I was fortunate
enough to watch at Lyft.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was last year.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you guys had a really nice discussion
about cannabis for cancer.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what I found really interesting about
the panel, you guys brought up some issues
[SPEAKER_16]: about cannabis being used as a miracle
versus a treatment and some dangers with
[SPEAKER_16]: that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I thought we could discuss a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyway, Marcia and Hillary,
please take the floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I can start.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm a palliative care doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I find that more and more when I'm
coming in contact with is patients who
[SPEAKER_06]: are, and of course, I see patients quite
late in the game where the cancer is no
[SPEAKER_06]: longer curative, curable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'm finding is happening more and
more is that patients are coming to me
[SPEAKER_06]: asking about medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to explore a little bit their
agenda in the sense of why are they,
[SPEAKER_06]: where are they coming from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they looking for symptom control or
are they looking for something else?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I find that often what's behind the
request isn't just symptom control,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they're asking more in terms of
cannabis as a cure for their cancer
[SPEAKER_06]: because they've been on the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have read the anecdotal reports
people will post on the internet about
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis curing their cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a conversation that I have to
have quite frequently with patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, and I know where they're
coming from because there's been a number
[SPEAKER_06]: of, there's been quite a bit of research,
I'd say since the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shows that cannabis does have certain
anti-tumor properties in preclinical
[SPEAKER_06]: models and preclinical experiments in
animal models and cultured cell lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is some science behind this,
but what we can't say at this point is
[SPEAKER_06]: that cannabis cures cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have the human trials at this
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while, you know, again, what happens
in a lab, what happens in a dog,
[SPEAKER_06]: what happens in a mouse cannot necessarily
be extrapolated to a human being.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plenty of chemotherapies that
showed a lot of promise in the lab that
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't pan out when they were tried in
human trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't at this point endorse it as a
cure for cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that a lot of patients are in a
position where, you know, they'll grasp at
[SPEAKER_06]: anything at the end of life and it's kind
of a hail Mary kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I kind of have to scale
things back a little bit and scale
[SPEAKER_06]: expectations back and say, you know,
symptom control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Curing cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're really not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the other problem is that the
dosages that are required, at least
[SPEAKER_06]: anecdotally, what the dosage sort of the
recipes that people post on the Internet
[SPEAKER_06]: are really big, you know, dosages required
somewhere in the ballpark of 500 to 1000
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, A, this is going to be
really expensive and B, this is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: there in a lot of side effects associated
with those who just that high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, people have to be warned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, having said that, if they still want
to go ahead and try this, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_06]: stop people.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least I warn them what to expect.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think that the science is
really interesting and I'd love to see
[SPEAKER_06]: some human trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I think is going to happen,
what I hope will happen down the road is
[SPEAKER_06]: that we'll see cannabis as an adjunct to
some of our other more traditional
[SPEAKER_06]: chemotherapies where it's used in
combination.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the thing with cancer is that
cancer is not one disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cancer is a lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, cancer, the ovary does not
behave like cancer, the breast,
[SPEAKER_06]: which does not behave like cancer,
the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every cancer is different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then even within, you know,
within just say breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a number of different breast
cancers and the treatment for each kind is
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically when you treat cancers,
you treat them with a very multimodal
[SPEAKER_06]: approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a number of different chemotherapies,
not just one, you know, plus radiation
[SPEAKER_06]: plus, you know, there's several modalities
to treat cancers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I don't think that even
given what we've seen in the lab,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we've seen some evidence of
anti-neoplastic properties, so anti-tumor
[SPEAKER_06]: properties, that doesn't mean that we're
seeing cures even in the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: What it means is that we're seeing cancer
slow down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing some regression of the
cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, again, in keeping with this
model of sort of a multimodal approach to
[SPEAKER_06]: cancer, what I hope to see down the road
is cancer kind of incorporated into our
[SPEAKER_06]: chemotherapy regimens as part of the
global approach to cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, cure is a big word and it's
just not a word that I think that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: use at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was kind of a long winded answer
to this, but that's the conversation that
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to have with patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, and that's important.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's an important conversation to
have.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so just going back a little bit,
as cancer not necessarily as a cure,
[SPEAKER_16]: but as an important adjunct treatment to
be used together with traditional
[SPEAKER_16]: therapies, can you tell us a little bit
about that also?
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of symptom management or in terms
of?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so for symptom management.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know more about cannabis use for
symptom management for chronic
[SPEAKER_16]: inflammatory diseases like pain
management, appetite, so I'm sure those
[SPEAKER_16]: types of things are obviously important
for someone with cancer.
[SPEAKER_16]: So even yeah, some ways or even like when
patients in your experience are using
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis to help with their treatment,
even how are they taking it?
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they mostly vaporizing?
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they taking orals?
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they even doing suppository?
[SPEAKER_16]: What kind of experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're talking about sort of symptom
management, which is really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I can say sort of most of my
patients that we're talking about symptom
[SPEAKER_06]: management.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we go sort of back in the in the kind
of old days before the MMPR patients for
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking, because that's what was
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm finding more and more that
patients are turning to oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of lung cancer patients,
for instance, in my outpatient clinics,
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizing or inhaling cannabis just too
irritating for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am finding more and more now that the
oils are more and more available as people
[SPEAKER_06]: are turning more and more into the oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're, you know, they're very user
friendly in the sense of administration,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can dose them quite, you know,
quite precisely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm seeing more and more shift toward
the oils, not just in my cancer patients,
[SPEAKER_06]: but even in the chronic pain population at
large.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really more in the sense of using
the oils for sort of long, I would say
[SPEAKER_06]: long term management, but what I mean more
in the sense of his long action prolonged
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the duration of action is
longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then using the inhaled more as sort of
a breakthrough, you know, so the pain,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they're taking the oil sort of
round the clock, but the pain is a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit worse at a certain point, or the
nausea is a little bit worse, they might
[SPEAKER_06]: take a puff of something inhaled just for,
you know, a quick hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no doubt what I'm seeing is really a
shift towards the oils.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what about THC CBD ratios?
[SPEAKER_16]: What are I'm sure there's a variety that
different patients prefer?
[SPEAKER_16]: But what what do you find is or what do
you tend to recommend more or start with?
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost always start with a one to one
ratio, particularly in a naive user,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to start with small doses with a
one to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll work from there and see an
experienced user.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bit of a different story.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're often they're there, they can
tolerate higher doses of THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my starters, I'll start with a one
to one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's sometimes what I'll do at
nighttime, for instance, is higher THC at
[SPEAKER_06]: nighttime, just to, you know, again,
help them sleep better, manage some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: other symptoms better at nighttime,
where I'm not as worried about the
[SPEAKER_06]: psychoactive effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you also work, I mean, your specialty
is palliative care.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, we talk about cannabis to help
patients with symptom management,
[SPEAKER_16]: we hinted a little bit about the potential
and the height, of course, of cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: being used as a cure.
[SPEAKER_16]: But what about cannabis to help give you a
good death?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like when you are at that end stage,
what about cannabis to help you die with
[SPEAKER_16]: dignity?
[SPEAKER_16]: What what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: At the very end?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we started talking to very,
yeah, there gets a bit tricky for me to
[SPEAKER_06]: answer, because the problem is,
is that my very end of life patients are
[SPEAKER_06]: often in hospital.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a little bit of a problem with
hospital policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So because what we're not really seeing in
Canadian hospitals yet is an adoption of
[SPEAKER_06]: any kind of cannabis policy in hospital.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the other problem with is, you know,
again, administration a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So patients that are at the very,
very end of life usually can't swallow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They certainly aren't going to inhale in
hospital.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we sort of haven't got
other forms that we can administer in
[SPEAKER_06]: hospital in any kind of legal way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's going on in people's houses at
home, if they're dying at home,
[SPEAKER_06]: might be a bit of a different story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really see as much of that because
most of my patients are dying on a
[SPEAKER_06]: palliative care unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And but that does sort of that does sort
of introduce the question of hospital
[SPEAKER_06]: policy, where are we going with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big question.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Selena.
[SPEAKER_16]: You had something to add to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Hillary has another question.
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's start with Selena's what she can
add to the topic of using cannabis to die
[SPEAKER_16]: with dignity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, death with dignity and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's near to my heart because I actually
had the first time experience of helping
[SPEAKER_09]: midwife my grandfather into the next using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were really fortunate in that we had
Interior Health, our nurses on our side
[SPEAKER_09]: supporting us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were also very lucky where Opa was not
sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was just very old and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: For us, it got to a point where he had
refused to eat and drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only thing that he would accept
near the end was his cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: He knew it was his medical marijuana oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: In hospital, I've had experiences where
some nurses are on board and they
[SPEAKER_09]: understand that, yes, it's something that
is so helpful and can be so necessary in
[SPEAKER_09]: helping just with pain management,
with symptom management, with helping to
[SPEAKER_09]: reduce the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that a lot of people near end of
life, they go through what I've seen is
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of this dark night where there's the
ego death.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I found that with cannabis,
it can be very helpful with that as well,
[SPEAKER_09]: just helping to ease that anxiety.
[SPEAKER_09]: With my grandfather, we were lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was able to use it at home right until
he passed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can happily say that he died with a
smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody is so lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for us, what made the difference
is I was an advocate and a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I pushed really hard to make sure that
they were able to have their final wishes
[SPEAKER_09]: met.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had a death at home certificate in
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a do not resuscitate order in
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were fully supported by the medical
community here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it took a lot of conversation,
a lot of education, a lot of back and
[SPEAKER_09]: forth with Interior Health to set this up
and make sure that we had just the proper
[SPEAKER_09]: safeties in place to make sure that there
weren't any contraindications.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, at the end, my opa was in
a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had reverted back to his very old
German and no one could understand him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was someone who had survived the
Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he was really going through a hard
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We knew that at some point we may need to
use morphine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And on his last night we did.
[SPEAKER_09]: But knowing that he was using cannabis,
we were able to use a very small dose.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we used less two milligrams of
morphine that helped him slip into a
[SPEAKER_09]: really beautiful sleep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, he passed with a smile on
his face.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think when people are in the know and
when you have a conversation with the
[SPEAKER_09]: medical community around you and the
support staff that you have on hand,
[SPEAKER_09]: we have caregivers that help us take care
of my grandmother now and also when my
[SPEAKER_09]: grandfather was alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: But making sure that everybody was
comfortable was the first piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for us to do that, education was the
first step.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody has the fortune of going
through such a beautiful experience,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I feel like it is so necessary for
people as we continue to move forward,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially when we look at end of life and
palliation and making people comfortable.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to get over this supposed moral
dilemma that there's something wrong with
[SPEAKER_09]: what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we look at ancient practices,
opium and cannabis were the most commonly
[SPEAKER_09]: used sacred plant medicines to help
someone transition into the next.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm excited that we're at this time of
reclamation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel honored and really blessed to
have had that experience with my opa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I could just say, I think you
raised some really interesting points.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that education is so important
because most people are still dying in
[SPEAKER_06]: hospitals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got to bring hospitals around to
have some kind of cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the really interesting thing in my
experience, I mean, I'm in a small town in
[SPEAKER_09]: British Columbia, Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the attitudes are quite
conservative.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some are quite progressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I found is that almost all of the
hospital staff wanted to support us in our
[SPEAKER_09]: use to use medicinal cannabis while my opa
was in the hospital, while my grandma was
[SPEAKER_09]: in the hospital recovering from hip
surgery.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was a stigma that they would
either get written up or lose their job or
[SPEAKER_09]: somehow have some kind of negative
repercussion come back on them if they
[SPEAKER_09]: were supporting our decision.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to just put it out there, I was given
the like, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't let any of you do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was tough for me in that I didn't
have the support from the medical
[SPEAKER_09]: community.
[SPEAKER_09]: But because of my background with
cannabis, I was able to help guide a
[SPEAKER_09]: process safely.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can't say that a lot of people are
in the same situation as I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think education is absolutely the very
first step when we look at harm reduction
[SPEAKER_09]: and making sure people can die with
dignity safely in their homes or in a
[SPEAKER_09]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it starts with education first.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to bring in Nisha into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to introduce you guys to Nisha
Whitley.
[SPEAKER_16]: So she authored the book.
[SPEAKER_16]: It is blinking from my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_16]: Chronic relief.
[SPEAKER_16]: Chronic relief.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so she wrote the book after dealing
with her mother's fight with lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_16]: So please bring in your perspective.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, everyone, for sharing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is a very important
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Natasha, so much for the
invitation to participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an honor to be here today and
have this conversation with such an
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible group of women.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my mom had lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of her life, she decided
that she wanted to utilize cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: because the opiates actually were making
her incredibly nauseous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had extreme pain, the nausea that
she was looking for relief from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for my mother, that was the
greatest indignity of her disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so utilize peanut butter cookies
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once she saw that that worked as
a savory things for her, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The relief that it gave her.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in addition to addressing the nausea
and the vomiting, neuropathic pain that
[SPEAKER_03]: the drugs absolutely could not touch in
this situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, really, probably the gift
for us was the fact that it made it
[SPEAKER_03]: possible for my mother to be present in
her last weeks and to receive all these
[SPEAKER_03]: people who came to pay their respects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, all of us were so grateful
for that experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's incredibly difficult to
watch somebody that you love suffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people at the end of life
really suffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just seems so unnecessary to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if cannabis is going to give them some
relief, why why would we not use that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was through our experience as a
family, seeing the relief that it brought
[SPEAKER_03]: my mom that I got curious about,
well, is this herb, this medicine illegal?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what led to writing the book
Chronic Relief, A Guide to Cannabis for
[SPEAKER_03]: the terminally and chronically ill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it took five years to write
that book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the course of that time,
I have seen so many people live better and
[SPEAKER_03]: die more comfortably and a gift to anyone
in that situation.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Hillary had a question.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to give the floor to Hill.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is your mic working?
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is she on mute?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Hill, your microphone isn't working.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, we'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_16]: What else?
[SPEAKER_16]: We were discussing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Hill, you may need to start restart
your computer if the sound is causing
[SPEAKER_16]: issues, but no problem.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just restart and then pop back in and join
us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Natasha.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could just address a little bit what
was just said, and I think some really
[SPEAKER_06]: important points were made about,
again, symptom relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the chronically ill, the terminally
ill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I think that I know from my
experiences, patients at the end of life,
[SPEAKER_06]: they do suffer and they suffer from a
variety of problems, not just pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's pain, there's nausea, there's
anxiety, there's sleep issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all kinds of stuff that's going
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And typically they're on a whole packet of
medications for these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And each medication comes with its own
baggage and its own side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you end up giving medications to
combat the side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: The side effects of the medications are
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you turn around, you've got a patient
on 20 different pills.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, again, cannabis,
you know, it hits so many bases.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it can cover the anxiety,
it can cover the pain, it can cover the
[SPEAKER_06]: appetite issues, it can cover the sleep
disorders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not try it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it allows you to often limit the
dosages of the other medications that the
[SPEAKER_06]: patients are taking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you can limit those dosages,
you can limit the side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you can limit the side effects,
you can often limit the other medications
[SPEAKER_06]: you're given to combat the side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if I can give someone one
thing that's going to cover four or five
[SPEAKER_06]: bases, why would I not try that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely agree with you, Marcia.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I've noticed,
just with working with medical patients,
[SPEAKER_09]: is that so many are on what I call a
tackle box of pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They come in, we go, we go through the
list.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what is just so profound to me is
that, you know, after a few weeks of using
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis, as long as there's no
contraindications with what they're on,
[SPEAKER_09]: they start to notice things like,
oh, I forgot my anxiety med this
[SPEAKER_09]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't need my sleeping pill.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I woke up without my chronic pain for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot my cane at the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had one person actually leave their
cane in the dispensary after medicating
[SPEAKER_09]: properly for the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it really goes to show how impactful it
can be on just like a short-term and a
[SPEAKER_09]: long-term shift, which I think is just so
exciting because I'm sure you see,
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcia, more than I do, especially when
we're talking about end of life,
[SPEAKER_09]: that palliation piece, the smells that
come out of people, a lot of it is the
[SPEAKER_09]: pharmaceuticals that, and that was one of
the comments that we had from the nurses
[SPEAKER_09]: that were helping us with OPPA,
was that there wasn't a smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we were able to get them off of
the few heart meds that he was on and,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, in the time that we could,
and it was just so powerful to see him not
[SPEAKER_09]: have to rely on that and to see patients
not have to rely on their tackle box
[SPEAKER_09]: anymore to get the relief that they need,
to get their quality of life back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, and I won't say the
pharmaceuticals don't work because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: tried and tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: They work.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the problem is, as I said- I agree,
I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for hammock, it wasn't necessary for
hammock.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have side effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's more- and this is the point,
is that patients are often turning to me
[SPEAKER_06]: at the end of life and saying,
I can't swallow all these pills.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too many.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a meal of pills for patients that can
have no appetite, have a lot of nausea,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're facing a meal of just pills.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're often saying to me,
what can I reduce?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what can I not take?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't take all these pills.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, again, that's where this comes
in so handy because it often does allow
[SPEAKER_06]: you to significantly reduce the number of
other pills you're taking.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important for us to
remember that there's- I mean,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's not one or the other.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a complementary thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a place for traditional
medications for certain purposes.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's also a place for medical
cannabis as well as other traditional or
[SPEAKER_16]: alternative or complementary, whatever you
want to call it, therapies.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Hillary, is your mic working yet?
[SPEAKER_16]: No.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to pop off the call and call
Dave and then do some troubleshooting,
[SPEAKER_16]: and then we'll get you back on?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so anyway, Nisha had something she
wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_16]: So please, please pop in, Nisha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that's a super important
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the pharmaceuticals work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes they cause terrible side
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was really beautiful for us when
we were utilizing the cannabis from a
[SPEAKER_03]: mother's end of life care is that she
still needed the opiates, but she needed
[SPEAKER_03]: less of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by taking less, the combination of the
opiates made it possible for her to get
[SPEAKER_03]: significant pain relief.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because she wasn't taking nearly as
much of the opiate, we found that the side
[SPEAKER_03]: effects were significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that combination is really what made
it possible for her to be present in a
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's super powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the opiate that we're facing in
North America, there's a great opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: to really look at how cannabis can work
with prescription drugs to lower risk for
[SPEAKER_03]: the patient, make them more comfortable,
and allow them to live with more quality
[SPEAKER_03]: of life.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just wanted to welcome Amanda to the
room.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Amanda is joining us from the Georgia
Strait.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she writes about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's the latest story you've been
working on, or what's coming up in the
[SPEAKER_16]: queue?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, working on cannabis is really,
it's never ending.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I worked on different beats,
and it was always a struggle to get in
[SPEAKER_10]: touch with contacts and people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I have people scrambling at me,
telling me their stories.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a great problem to have.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just wanted to touch, I know before
I joined in, you guys were talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: end of life care and dying with dignity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to share a story that
I'm sort of working on right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But just kind of an issue that I'm trying
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a man who is helping his father
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's also got dementia.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's 92 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was on pharmaceuticals for 20
years, trying to get through these issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: And nothing worked for him.
[SPEAKER_10]: This man saw his father's life kind of
coming to an end.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way he described it to me was that
it was like a plane crash, kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: cartwheeling down the runway.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was just constantly anxious,
never in a good mood, always falling over
[SPEAKER_10]: and just not very steady on his feet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he heard about cannabis and went
to go visit Andrea Dawes of the Village,
[SPEAKER_10]: who I think will be joining us later on,
who got him in touch with the right people
[SPEAKER_10]: in the industry here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, I mean, I met this man and he,
of course, he's elderly, but he's got
[SPEAKER_10]: vibrancy in his skin again.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's able to communicate a little bit
better with his family and with his son.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the issue is that the son is so
worried that if the wrong people find out
[SPEAKER_10]: that this is what he's doing to treat his
father's condition, his father's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be taken away or put in a home or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously, that's not what he wants to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for me, as a journalist, this is an
incredible story to tell, especially for
[SPEAKER_10]: all the people that don't believe in how
cannabis can really work for people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, yeah, it's a struggle sometimes to
kind of find people who are willing to
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of speak on record and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But more and more, I'm seeing people come
out of their, you know, there's not really
[SPEAKER_10]: that fear anymore to identify yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the odd person who won't give me
their last name or something, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's incredible to watch this dynamic and
how things are constantly growing and
[SPEAKER_10]: changing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave it up to the medical people to
respond to that one.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Nisha just shared in the group an
article that she's working on with Martin
[SPEAKER_16]: Lee for Project CBD, talking about
cannabis for Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to tell us a little bit about
that, Nisha?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Parkinson's is an incredibly
complicated disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, generally it's associated
with motor symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rigidity, tremor, those types of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, what we're finding is that
what works for one Parkinson's patient may
[SPEAKER_03]: not work for the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one of the beautiful things
about cannabis is that has the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: to ultimately become highly individualized
medicine because the chemical components
[SPEAKER_03]: in plant samples are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what works for one person may not
work for the other, but there's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: something out there for most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, in Bonnie Goldstein's
book, she talks about the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: several of her patients with Parkinson's
have had great benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them got great benefit from higher
doses of CBD, whereas some benefited from
[SPEAKER_03]: something that has significantly more THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in talking with Dr. Ethan Russo and
Zeno, Dr. Sanchez-Ramos, they both were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that what they're seeing is success
when people are using a one-to-one THC-CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this disease is really interesting
because the endocannabinoid system is at
[SPEAKER_03]: play here on so many different levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And science is starting to indicate that
actually the motor symptoms associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with Parkinson's disease may actually be
very late stage symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, you know, there are four
interesting symptoms that show up 10 to 12
[SPEAKER_03]: years before the motor symptoms present
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are loss of sense of smell and
constipation, sleep disturbances,
[SPEAKER_03]: and depression, and that these motor
symptoms don't actually present themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: until 60 to 80% of the dopaminergic
neurons actually die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there is this interesting play
between the microbiome and our
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system, which are,
you know, that's your specialty,
[SPEAKER_03]: the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you can really speak to
that relationship between that
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system and then how that
connects with the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we don't really have enough
information right now to say, here's
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly how cannabis is going to help a
Parkinson's patient and how they might be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to use it effectively to either slow
the progression of the disease or manage
[SPEAKER_03]: symptoms, at least we know that it's
certainly safe enough for patients that
[SPEAKER_03]: choose to do so to experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that over time, science is
going to really teach us a lot about how
[SPEAKER_03]: we can effectively use cannabis to manage
this disease and others.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a lot of information to think
about.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's also interesting you brought up,
well, the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_16]: something that's dear to me is even how
bacteria may be playing a role in,
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we talk a lot about good bacteria
and bad bacteria, like good bacteria like
[SPEAKER_16]: probiotics and in healthy foods,
whereas bad bacteria can cause infection,
[SPEAKER_16]: can lead to sepsis and other issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's interesting to think of those
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know about how they influence our immune
response more, but it's interesting to
[SPEAKER_16]: think about how the bacteria would also be
affecting our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Hillary's back.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, is your mic working?
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing, testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so wonderful to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I often try to do hash church and just
can't drag my butt out of bed to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis on a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is as much as I love talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Sunday mornings are pretty precious,
but this feels like a fine way to spend
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so lovely to see all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just missed some of the conversation
because I was getting assisted in working
[SPEAKER_05]: out how to get my mic working.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark bubble man for sending us a note on
how to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to just go back and ask
Marcia a question if that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and if you already covered this while
I was gone, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But first of all, Marcia, I just wanted to
thank you and acknowledge that you've been
[SPEAKER_05]: a really important teacher and supporter
for me as I am a patient educator and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: talking all the time to people who want to
use high dose cannabis or high dose THC
[SPEAKER_05]: protocols for kind of their Hail Mary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've given me a lot of really
important guidance about the right
[SPEAKER_05]: questions to ask patients about the
choices they're making about what their
[SPEAKER_05]: quality of life is going to be like in
those last few days, if it really is kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of a Hail Mary.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to ask a question about to
the panel about suppositories because
[SPEAKER_05]: there are often folks that I know want to
use suppositories because they believe
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can get the therapeutic effects
without the psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that we don't have a ton of
clinical evidence on it, but I'm curious
[SPEAKER_05]: about your opinions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not a medical professional,
but my understanding is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the colon and the GI, the colon is not
meant for uptake.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of meant as like a
container and to get things out of our
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, currently one of my best friends who
Marcia knows has pretty serious
[SPEAKER_05]: metastasized stage four breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's looking at going back on high
dose cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's talking about paranoid therapies
and is talking about suppositories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I'm curious what you think about
the being able to balance not fielding the
[SPEAKER_05]: psychoactive effects with actually getting
the therapeutic effects when using
[SPEAKER_05]: suppositories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think suppositories are a good
form of administration for a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: medications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, things get to absorbed through the
mucosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but I don't have a lot of experience
in terms of rectal administration of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause again, I mean, we, at least from a
legal standpoint, those aren't really
[SPEAKER_06]: available for those aren't available from
the LPs at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't speak so much to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's potentially a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm not sure whether you eliminate the
psychoactivity or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, there is systemic absorption.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I couldn't speak to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm sure there's a lot of patients who
are trying this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but you know, I, again, I think it's a
terrific idea, particularly at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: life and patients who are having trouble
swallowing, uh, that would be a great
[SPEAKER_06]: route of administration, but, um,
you know, just not available at this
[SPEAKER_06]: point, aside from through dispensaries,
but your license producers is not
[SPEAKER_06]: available, but I'm sure there's a lot of
anecdotal reports.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Selena, you have some experience
working with suppositories.
[SPEAKER_16]: And before I give you the floor,
I also want to say, um, we're working on,
[SPEAKER_16]: on putting together a case report or,
uh, like a case series of patients who are
[SPEAKER_16]: using suppository cannabis, uh,
especially interact all for, uh,
[SPEAKER_16]: gut conditions such as Crohn's and
colitis.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and we're also interested in women who
are using cannabis suppository,
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, inter vaginal or interact all to help
with their menstrual symptoms.
[SPEAKER_16]: So go ahead, Selena, um, have a floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Suppositories are near and dear to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that it sounds so weird,
but, um, Marcia, I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, this is old medicine and, uh,
it's medicine that's been used in Europe
[SPEAKER_09]: and across the world for eons.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems that, uh, the attitudes in North
America are really the only ones that are
[SPEAKER_09]: preventing people from embracing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm excited that we're really on,
uh, the edge of this going more public,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, beyond dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, in my experience, um, just helping
guide people's processes when they do want
[SPEAKER_09]: to dose, um, with high THC cannabinoids,
um, through a rectal administration.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it would be beautiful to think
that, yes, you can have these really high
[SPEAKER_09]: doses of THC without any type of,
um, discomfort or euphoria.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it really depends on where you place
it in the rectum.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we've learned is that, uh,
any placement farther than the first
[SPEAKER_09]: knuckle has, uh, the chance of hitting a
part of the inner colon that correlates
[SPEAKER_09]: with the liver, which actually breaks down
THC and produces that euphoric effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're inserting the suppository too
high, we can, um, still have those,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, those symptoms that people are trying
to avoid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and in my experience also,
it's not a one-size-fits-all approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really does depend on the gut health of
that individual when we start and how we
[SPEAKER_09]: continue to progress.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked with people with ostomy bags
that have had little to no success.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked with people, um, that have,
uh, that are at end of life that are
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for pain management that were able
to only get, uh, minor bits of relief.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it really depends on the individual.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, in my experience, uh, we usually
start off with a lower dose, uh,
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure that that individual has a
positive experience first so they're not
[SPEAKER_09]: taking a hundred milligrams of THC and
completely trip in balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we've had that, um, and that's where,
you know, again, education, proper
[SPEAKER_09]: instructions, having a very firm
conversation and making sure that
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody's completely comfortable with
the process before they engage is
[SPEAKER_09]: paramount.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and on top of that, ongoing,
just ongoing support, ongoing
[SPEAKER_09]: communication.
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone is under the impression that
they've purchased a month's worth of
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine and halfway through, nothing's
really happening and we don't have any,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, information around that, I can't
continue to help guide a process.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is an ongoing conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but yeah, the most important thing
that I've noticed is it really depends on
[SPEAKER_09]: that individual's gut health specifically
in the ability to absorb that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, fully or at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Marcia.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could just say, I think what you're
also speaking to is the fact that,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, responses to cannabis are so
individualized.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, it's, and that's really,
that's really the point is that how person
[SPEAKER_06]: A responds to the same strain and dose as
person B can be wildly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really is no one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredibly individualized
personalized medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I feel like having that
preliminary conversation, like the two,
[SPEAKER_09]: like you and Hillary are talking about
seeing where that person is at,
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing what they're comfortable with,
um, and helping guide a process for their
[SPEAKER_09]: best benefit, not a one size fits all
approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we look at, uh, I just look at
cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can have the exact same cut
from the same mother grown at the same
[SPEAKER_09]: cycle and there could still be variants
and you know, biochemically there can be a
[SPEAKER_09]: huge difference for a person that's
accessing that same, same genetic,
[SPEAKER_09]: that same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so it really, it depends.
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of the conversation I like to have
with medical patients is learning how to
[SPEAKER_09]: tune into yourself, learning how to listen
to your body, learning how to read those
[SPEAKER_09]: signs and symptoms and really be able to
guide your own process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as you mentioned, starting really
small and increasing your doses,
[SPEAKER_06]: because if you overwhelm them in the
beginning with side effects, you've got a
[SPEAKER_06]: patient who's not going to keep going with
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have a fear response in someone
who's already sick, you're going to create
[SPEAKER_09]: more inflammation, more stress,
uh, and you're just going to exacerbate
[SPEAKER_09]: something that doesn't need to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for us, a low and so approach is always
the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to make sure that people are
comfortable with their dosing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as much as I may have an opinion,
um, it ultimately is up to that person and
[SPEAKER_09]: their comfort level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and I also just want to add something
to what Selena was saying about where you
[SPEAKER_16]: in search the suppository and part of the
reason why, when you insert it,
[SPEAKER_16]: like you said, the one knuckle or the more
shallow, um, and even some people aren't
[SPEAKER_16]: using full suppositories.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're taking a little bit of their
extract, just putting it on a gloved
[SPEAKER_16]: finger and just like inserting a little
bit of the oil just straight like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But part of the reason, um, why there's
different effects versus a shallow
[SPEAKER_16]: insertion or going up deeper is because
the vasculature that's happening,
[SPEAKER_16]: um, at the early rectum is actually
getting some of that stuff to go
[SPEAKER_16]: systemically.
[SPEAKER_16]: And like you said, Selena, go to the liver
and may result in psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to be careful when we tell
patients you can go interact all because
[SPEAKER_16]: you won't get psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, again, it depends on the patient,
the dose, the formula.
[SPEAKER_16]: If the formula has, um, various compounds
to help boost absorption, that can also
[SPEAKER_16]: play a role.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know more about this from the point of
topicals like skin formulations.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but before I go on, I want to do a
little, a little intro of everyone now
[SPEAKER_16]: that we've almost got a full house.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to read a little sentence
just to kind of give our audience some
[SPEAKER_16]: context of where we're all coming from.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to start just across the
panel.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll start with, uh, Selena who's
seated beside me.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Selena Wong is the co-founder of
the flower of life compassion club,
[SPEAKER_16]: compassion club.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Selena and I, uh, I love you Selena.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've met so many times at various
conferences and I've just been always
[SPEAKER_16]: inspired by, uh, just how well Selena is
able to advocate for patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, she's got really interesting
experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, it should come up later with,
um, her grandma who suffers from
[SPEAKER_16]: Alzheimer's disease and Selena and her
partner are, um, they live with their
[SPEAKER_16]: grandma and take care of her.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we've bonded a lot over this
experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: My grandma also has Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we, we've bonded a lot over sharing
our personal experience and difficulties
[SPEAKER_16]: about this.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here, Selena.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And next we have Sarah Russo and Sarah is
the creative director at project CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Sarah and I, we've not actually met
or had the pleasure to hang out in person
[SPEAKER_16]: yet, but we've had a few Skype dates.
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, um, thank you very much for
being here.
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate your perspective and
it's really awesome for you to join us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, I also want to hear more about
the fast you've just been on.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Sarah has been experimenting with some
different ways and we've been talking
[SPEAKER_16]: about, um, different things to try eating
for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, one of my friends, uh,
Dr. Frenzy graph for, she's almost a
[SPEAKER_16]: doctor, just finishing up her PhD,
um, has been helping, uh, with some,
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, consults on techniques for fasting.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we can talk about that a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have Rosie.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Rosie, Rosie.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so Rosie's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's also the owner, um, of quadrant
extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so maybe you CO2.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's that quadrant time attack actually.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, so just tell me a little bit
about it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me, give me your break.
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically we established extraction and
processing laboratories.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we work with authorized growers,
licensed producers comes up, but I
[SPEAKER_13]: actually quite like working with MMARs.
[SPEAKER_13]: The MMARs are entitled to do research and
development on extraction methods on
[SPEAKER_13]: behalf of their patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we basically put together the full
service, uh, labs from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've actually built a CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're building an alcohol extractor.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are building a fractional distillation
unit, which is quite new to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know of anyone that's building
them here in Canada, so that's pretty
[SPEAKER_13]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then once we have the, they can set up
whatever component of the lab that they
[SPEAKER_13]: want.
[SPEAKER_13]: We work with them to determine their
needs.
[SPEAKER_13]: We apply the personnel as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have three chemists that work with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we work with the growers to work
on extraction methods and formulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, and then at the end of it,
we have the end delivery devices as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have vape pens.
[SPEAKER_13]: Eventually we're getting into capsules and
suppositories, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I love coming in and hearing that was
the first topic.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the, one of the hats.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other hat that I have is as
executive director of the cannabis trade
[SPEAKER_13]: Alliance of Canada, which is really,
I mean, it's all a passion project,
[SPEAKER_13]: but that's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can talk about that later in the
lobby.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that that's one of the main
efforts that we've been doing with all
[SPEAKER_13]: levels of government.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so next to Rosie, we have Nisha
Whitley.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I said before, she wrote the book,
chronic relief, a guide to cannabis for
[SPEAKER_16]: the terminally and chronically ill.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Nisha also does education.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's a very good speaker.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had the pleasure of hanging out and
meeting at patients at a time in
[SPEAKER_16]: Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nisha was one of the people that my friend
and colleague, Ethan Russo was like,
[SPEAKER_16]: you need to meet Nisha.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so he connected us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Ethan actually wrote the forward to
Nisha's book.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then besides, sorry, sorry,
say a few words.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then beside Nisha, we have Dr. Marcia
Gilman, and she's a palliative care
[SPEAKER_16]: physician, and she's the Associate Medical
Director of Sante Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And me and Marcia had the pleasure of
hanging out at CCIC in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had a very nice time, a nice ladies
dinner.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there was other people there,
but it was the ladies hanging out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hillary was also there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that was an awesome chance to
connect with both of you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then right beside Marcia, we have
Hillary Black.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hillary is the founder of the BC
Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's the Director of Patient
Education and Advocacy at Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Hillary has been around in the scene
for a long time and has a lot of stories.
[SPEAKER_16]: She told me she also has some interesting
stories about our regular host,
[SPEAKER_16]: Marcus, and also Todd McCormick,
and some of the early stories of getting
[SPEAKER_16]: to know those fine folk.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, we'll bring that up a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then next to her, we have Amanda
Siebert.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she is a journalist for the Georgia
Straight in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's in charge of their cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so really killing it lately with some
really good stories.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate you sharing the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, beside her, we have Natasha
Ray.
[SPEAKER_16]: And not to be confused with me,
Natasha Riz, we've got two of you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Natasha is representing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Natasha is a serial entrepreneur
and philanthropist.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she is co-founder of She Talks Global.
[SPEAKER_16]: And welcome, Natasha.
[SPEAKER_16]: So please tell us a little bit more about
yourself.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just joined us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't really hear anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can?
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have been working in the cannabis
industry for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I started with my work with Lyft
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm still a little involved with Lyft,
not as much as I was before.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm involved with a few recreational
brands out here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm on the West Coast in Vancouver right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I'm splitting my time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I live in Vancouver one week and then
in Toronto one week, where I just opened a
[SPEAKER_15]: multidisciplinary health care center.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have a compounding pharmacy,
walk-in clinic, family practice,
[SPEAKER_15]: chiro and physio under one roof.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we're looking at adding in some
diagnostic services over the next few
[SPEAKER_15]: years on our second floor.
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully adding in some ultrasound and
x-ray capability.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the reason I opened with the
pharmacy was with the idea that once
[SPEAKER_15]: distribution goes that way medically,
that our pharmacy will sort of serve as a
[SPEAKER_15]: distribution channel.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, that's mainly what I'm doing
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, thank you to everyone for being
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy we get to spend our Sunday
morning hanging out together.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to give the floor back to
Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to talk a little bit about
cannabis and seniors.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think Hilary had a story she wanted
to share with us.
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's have the floor, Hil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And first, I just also want to make a
quick comment to Selena that when I have
[SPEAKER_05]: interacted with your crew at medical
cannabis conferences, I've always been
[SPEAKER_05]: really stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like your organization has really
made such an effort to do some of the best
[SPEAKER_05]: practices around cannabis distribution,
including integrating other kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: health care.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's sort of what Natasha was just
talking about, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the work that many of the women
on this panel are doing looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis as a part of an integrated health
care plan in the way that my compassion
[SPEAKER_05]: club 20 years ago started funding a
wellness center.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really cool to see that work alive
and well today in this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before we did this awesome round of
intros, somebody was talking a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: about seniors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's currently is a really big
passion of mine is working with seniors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I feel like it's a population
where there's still a lot of barriers to
[SPEAKER_05]: access around stigma and also particularly
seniors that are in long term health care
[SPEAKER_05]: facilities like Marcia was talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's sort of a lack of good policies
for people being able to use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: those facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also our seniors are also often on a
lot of polypharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and there's also cautions, things that
we have to be careful around, around like
[SPEAKER_05]: risks of falling and dizziness and some of
the side effects of using cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_05]: more extreme for seniors.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to tell you a story about my
grandma Jean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, grandma Jean turned one
hundred and one two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy birthday to grandma Jean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandpa lived until he was also one
hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Richardson knew my grandparents as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, good genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know that side of the family.
[SPEAKER_05]: They lived really, really old.
[SPEAKER_05]: So grandma Jean, when I started working in
medical cannabis 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: and there was press about it, she would be
at the art club or at Bridge and her
[SPEAKER_05]: friends would be like, oh, I saw that
marijuana dog granddaughter of yours in
[SPEAKER_05]: the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was kind of embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like I was a weed dealer who was
out of the closet and there wasn't such a
[SPEAKER_05]: thing in the country before that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was kind of like a little bit a
bit embarrassed of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in very I think was very early
2000s, David Suzuki in the Navy and Nature
[SPEAKER_05]: of Things did a piece on the Compassion
Club and on Valerie Corral and her amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: work at WAM in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sort of changed the tune of the
conversations that my grandma was having
[SPEAKER_05]: with her friends about medical cannabis,
because now David Suzuki said that he
[SPEAKER_05]: thought it was a pretty great thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fast forward a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a bunch of years and a couple of
years ago, my grandma had really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really terrible flare up of her arthritis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was sleeping in her easy chair like
she couldn't really lie down and sleep at
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was trying to sleep in her easy
chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she wasn't very mobile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they she was prescribed T threes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the coding in the T threes made her
super constipated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they prescribed her medication to
address the constipation, which started
[SPEAKER_05]: causing accidents.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she basically was like, I'm done if
this is what life is like, and my you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, like her caregivers and her
granddaughter need to come over and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, like there's been an accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, basically, she like was pooping
on the sofa occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bit of an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, she was done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then she finally agreed to try using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this was before the LPs were
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like there I didn't I couldn't access
an oil that had I knew exactly how many
[SPEAKER_05]: milligrams of THC and CBD it had.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started with a tincture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started with what was just like kind of
a medium strength indica slash sativa kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of like hopefully it had a little bit of
all the like as many cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible in it as many terpenes as
possible in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started her on one drop and then
the next day two drops and the next day
[SPEAKER_05]: three drops and the next day four drops
because I really wanted to make sure that
[SPEAKER_05]: we avoided any kind of adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So day by day not increasing the dose
within one day but separating it out by
[SPEAKER_05]: day, we increase slowly, slowly and it
took about 10 days until she started
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling some effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the it was an effective anti
inflammatory and pain control for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She started being able to sleep and move
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: She stopped taking the coding.
[SPEAKER_05]: She stopped being constipated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really amazing benefit for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she goes to her doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: She goes to her GP and says, you wouldn't
believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling so much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sleeping.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the coding anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not constipated anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: My granddaughter put me on cannabis
tincture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And her doctor said, Jean Black,
if you keep using that stuff, it's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to rot holes in your brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I quote, rot holes in your brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I won't be your doctor anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is only like five years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like cannabis is going to rot holes in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandma is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has she like she remembers everything
that ever happened for the past hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, like her mind is like a steel
trap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was super freaked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, didn't want to use cannabis
anymore because a her doctor was going to
[SPEAKER_05]: fire her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And B, she was afraid of the consequences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I wish that I had recorded this
phone call.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I asked Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
who I'm sure most of you all know who he
[SPEAKER_05]: is, I won't have to explain who to have a
call with my grandma.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I sat in on a three way phone call with
Dr. Lester Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my grandma, as he explained to her,
he's like the godfather of our medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis movement about how what her
doctor had told her was incorrect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my grandma went marching back in to
see her GP and said, Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
[SPEAKER_05]: a retired medical professor from Harvard,
who's a well known expert and author on
[SPEAKER_05]: the subject would like to speak to you
about what you said to me about medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he never followed up on the phone
call.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was like, well, whatever,
just basically keep using your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm not going to help you with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I don't need to get it from
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my granddaughter.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was slated for a second hip
replacement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my little sister took grandma to go
see her her surgeon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the surgeon said, Gene, your hips
haven't looked this good in 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like whatever you're doing, keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need another hip replacement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wrote a really strongly worded
letter to the GP about how grandma's
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis therapies are not to be
interrupted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And later, she had a big tumor in her
throat and went through a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: radiation that was had some kind of nasty
side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she leaned pretty heavily on the
cannabis to get through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she is the most amazing advocate.
[SPEAKER_05]: The person who's driving the handy dart is
going to hear about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The person who's checking out her
groceries is going to hear about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The person in the elevator on the way to
her medical appointment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever tried this marijuana stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm super grateful for how it has
helped my grandma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was interesting watching her
transition into like, she often would like
[SPEAKER_05]: to have a gin and tonic in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes if she's like being a bit
bitchy with super old people can get a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit cranky and fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's 100 years old, she's allowed to get
cranky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes her caregivers will like
encourage her to have her gin and tonic in
[SPEAKER_05]: the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she sort of transitioned into
realizing that using her cannabis to feel
[SPEAKER_05]: giggly, or to feel good and kind and yummy
is okay, that it doesn't have to be just
[SPEAKER_05]: about pain relief, but that in fact,
it's okay to use it just to like,
[SPEAKER_05]: have a giggle in the afternoon instead of
virgin and tonic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was just a little story about
grandma Jean.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just say something just around the
physician piece, because it's clearly like
[SPEAKER_15]: the industry and the business I own right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a huge point of contention for
me, because I need to see like how we can
[SPEAKER_15]: work together to help our physicians feel
like they have enough understanding so
[SPEAKER_15]: that they can do the prescribing and
monitor their patients.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I have five doctors who work for
me, and only one of them will prescribe.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's Daniel Schechter.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other four are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're amazing physicians, and they use
cannabis recreationally.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's really hard to get them to come
over that hump and to understanding that
[SPEAKER_15]: this is a modality of treatment,
and this should be a modality of treatment
[SPEAKER_15]: before a lot of other things that we're
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So like, how do we get to that tipping
point so that physicians feel comfortable?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I understand and I empathize with
where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just I want to know how we save the
world.
[SPEAKER_15]: They need accredited education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, like and you know,
we should let Marcia speak to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can see you're smiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: She wants to say it's something that I
think a number of the LPs invest quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot into.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for what I've seen, it's one of the
most important things to help sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: moving physicians is either they're
hearing amazing experiences from their
[SPEAKER_05]: patients, or they're receiving like proper
accredited education.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll hand it over to you, Marcia.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the biggest barrier to access
in Canada currently is education,
[SPEAKER_06]: physician education, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the biggest problem the way I see
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just a question of continuing
medical education at, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the level of physicians that are out there
already practicing in the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it really has to start earlier,
much earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we need to see some cannabis
education introduced at the medical school
[SPEAKER_06]: level.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually it's virtually nonexistent
in the medical school curriculum.
[SPEAKER_06]: I teach residents all the time and the
endocannabinoid system is complete news to
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've never heard about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that until we start seeing some
of this education integrated at the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical school level, we're not going to
see enough changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think continuing medical education is
great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's necessary.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I said, it's got to start even
before that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's not enough to just do the
CME is like it needs to.
[SPEAKER_15]: And even the residents who are coming out
like I just hired a girl who just came out
[SPEAKER_15]: of med school.
[SPEAKER_15]: So she just finished her residency and
she's like right at the very end of
[SPEAKER_15]: residency is when we received a little bit
of medical marijuana training.
[SPEAKER_15]: But clearly, that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so how do we Yeah, there's very little
I think I think that here in Quebec,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that and we have Mark Weir here in
Montreal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even with Mark Weir's input,
I think he told me last time that he's got
[SPEAKER_06]: about an hour and the entire medical
school curriculum in which he can teach
[SPEAKER_06]: something about endocannabinoids,
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's here in Montreal, it's you
know, it really is not on the curriculum
[SPEAKER_06]: of most medical schools at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet the residents are interested when
I teach them when it when they come around
[SPEAKER_06]: and they do their rotations on palliative
care on my palliative care service.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're fascinated when I sit down and
start talking to them about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's news to them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and so many of them are so
fascinated in pain management.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's interesting that they have a
fascination and want to do a subspecialty
[SPEAKER_15]: in pain management, but then cannabis
doesn't even factor into that in their own
[SPEAKER_15]: training.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's yeah, it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other piece I wanted to just add
quickly was, I think destigmatization is
[SPEAKER_09]: also a really important factor when we're
talking about physicians being more
[SPEAKER_09]: comfortable with prescribing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know within our organization,
we have two physicians that work with us,
[SPEAKER_09]: but same as your situation, they're just
not comfortable actually endorsing a
[SPEAKER_09]: patient putting their name down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that as we continue to have these
conversations, Hillary, as your grandma
[SPEAKER_09]: continues to talk to people in the
elevator and at bridge or wherever she
[SPEAKER_09]: goes, I think that's where it's going to
start.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the more people are
comfortable having that conversation with
[SPEAKER_09]: their doctor and their physician,
even if they're met with a no,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be a better step
because as those physicians are
[SPEAKER_09]: coming to one of the biggest things that
we hear from physicians is I don't believe
[SPEAKER_09]: in this medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my qualm with that is we're talking
about hard science.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not talking about a belief.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not talking about a spiritual
preference here, a religion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about hard facts.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we look at research from anywhere else
in the world outside of Canada,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's very clear that cannabis can be so
helpful in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there really isn't harm as long as
we're using it properly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it starts with a
destigmatization, also with a conversation
[SPEAKER_09]: with a physician in the first place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for us, what we do is help guide that
conversation with patients to begin to
[SPEAKER_09]: have, to at least bridge that chat with
their doctors.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone else is speaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Selena, stigma is misunderstanding and
the solution to misunderstanding is
[SPEAKER_06]: education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it all comes back to the same thing
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could just jump in here for a second.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recently spoke with a clinical counselor
in Kamloops.
[SPEAKER_10]: His name is Michael Cohen and he's running
this incredible program where he brings in
[SPEAKER_10]: a medicinal cannabis user and a doctor who
may or may not support cannabis fully or
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously not to the extent where they're
prescribing it to their patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what he does is he sort of facilitates
a conversation between these two people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he encourages the cannabis user to use
their medicine in front of the doctor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what this does for the doctor is it
shows them how quickly, how effectively
[SPEAKER_10]: this medicine works for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says every single person that he's
spoken with, every doctor, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: after this experience, they come out of it
understanding like, wow, I need to be
[SPEAKER_10]: using this in my own practice.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think if we have more doctors who
are willing to kind of step up and take on
[SPEAKER_10]: that educational role, and we do see so
many people doing that, I think it'll kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of open the doors for other people who are
maybe kind of hesitant about jumping right
[SPEAKER_10]: into cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I can just add to that,
in addition to education, having sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: rotations where residents can rotate
through places like Santee cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we have a number of doctors who are
academic physicians that are actually
[SPEAKER_06]: involved there, if we could actually have
residents rotating through these kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: spaces, that would help enormously as well
in terms of hands on experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been my experience that the doctor
education really needs to come from other
[SPEAKER_03]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, I gave a three hour cannabis
101 educational seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really intended to help bridge the
gap between science and safe practical
[SPEAKER_03]: application for the terminally and
chronically ill and their caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't directed to doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: My job is to educate the lay people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had three physicians in the
audience, two of which were actually
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsors of the event, one of which was
the sponsor of the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, at the end of this three hour
presentation, voiced his disapproval of
[SPEAKER_03]: the content that I had presented,
which was all sourced with medical
[SPEAKER_03]: journals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was based in science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very clear when I'm talking about
this is science and this is anecdotal
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end, it was like, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've done a complete disservice
to our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the information that you have shared
here is scientifically unfounded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a very dangerous drug that is
highly addictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fortunately kind of dampened the
spirit of the workshop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was really interesting to me is
that the audience members really took
[SPEAKER_03]: offense to his position.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what he was upset about was the
fact that he has a child who is in an
[SPEAKER_03]: addiction counseling program receiving
treatment for cannabis addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Believes very strongly in the NIDA reports
that we have four million Americans who
[SPEAKER_03]: are addicted to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the majority of those who are in those
treatment programs are actually there
[SPEAKER_03]: through court mandated requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's court mandated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not checking themselves in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two points.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, I think that the doctor education
really needs to come from physicians and
[SPEAKER_03]: research scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two, at some point, I hope we can
have a little chat about addiction today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nishi, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we definitely have on our list that we
should come circle around and talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God we have a couple of hours to
chat because there is so much awesome
[SPEAKER_05]: content coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been chatting about physician
education.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we can talk about education but
in a slightly broader way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd love to bring you in, Rosie,
because I know that one of your superhero
[SPEAKER_05]: powers is besides being a ninja black belt
schmoozer, you are an amazing educator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw that when a lot of us were very
busy working on educating the task force
[SPEAKER_05]: last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kind of like circled the wagons
around them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shoved a lot of information down their
throats that wasn't what they thought they
[SPEAKER_05]: were going to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if you can talk just a
little bit about your experience with
[SPEAKER_05]: education in terms of government
relations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you did amazing work with the feds and
the task force.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're looking at maybe we can talk
about the provincial government in BC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the government relations work
in schmoozing, or I should say lobbying,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Advocating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Advocating that you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where are we at in BC with our current
bureaucrats and the crazy state of the
[SPEAKER_05]: government here?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much education do you think is in
front of us?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just hand that over to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot better with you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's back up a little bit first and
just kind of talk about the education
[SPEAKER_13]: process overall.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what happens is we've been
consumed in this industry I'm getting
[SPEAKER_13]: feedback, sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been involved in this industry
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I make no qualms about the fact that I've
been a consumer for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are all in one way or the other have
been entrenched in this industry for
[SPEAKER_13]: years, for all of us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much we know about the plant because
we're in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And especially because a lot of us are
here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as we know, 80% of the cannabis in
Canada comes from British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we have to remember that when
we move into legalization, we have a whole
[SPEAKER_13]: bunch of people out there, the general
public, the politicians who have really
[SPEAKER_13]: never been exposed to this plant before.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they have been exposed to the
plant, it's been a very negative
[SPEAKER_13]: experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know people who have known that have
known me throughout my adult life and
[SPEAKER_13]: known my position on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a criminology background,
and then I went on to law school.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, the prohibition of cannabis
never made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a product that I worked very well
with my body.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alcohol never worked well for me at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just, the illegality of it just
didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've always kind of treated it like
it's quasi legal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now we have to take those experiences
and explain it to people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, what is it really all about?
[SPEAKER_13]: That the fact is that consumers do look
like us, that they're not all just,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, these old brats.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the kind of things that grow
that people think that it's all about.
[SPEAKER_13]: So then teaching them just about the
plant, that it's not a scary plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: that the different aspects of the plant,
the different iterations of the plant as
[SPEAKER_13]: it grows, when the psychotropic properties
of the plant kick in.
[SPEAKER_13]: People don't know this at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I find what we've been logging for at
the federal level, and I'll start with
[SPEAKER_13]: that because that to me is actually a
really big one, it's breaking up the ACM
[SPEAKER_13]: PR the way it's set up right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: because the way it's set up is you have to
be able to do everything from seed to
[SPEAKER_13]: sale.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I always challenge anyone to find
another industry that it's set up in that
[SPEAKER_13]: way where you have to specialize no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you've got to specialize from your
nursery, you have to specialize to
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivate, you have to specialize to
process all the way, and you have to be
[SPEAKER_13]: able to do it all in one basket.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been advocating to break it up so
that nurseries should be on their own.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some amazing geneticists that want
to work just on propagating the plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: working on cloning, tissue culturing,
and they should be, if they want to
[SPEAKER_13]: specialize just in that, they should do
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's in a standalone nursery where you
can be growing this plant next to tomatoes
[SPEAKER_13]: if you want to, or in separate rooms,
but those are nurseries.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's nursery propagation.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so much research that can be done
for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do it at different footprints.
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly you don't need the security
requirements that you would require to be
[SPEAKER_13]: a cultivator or processor.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a plant that doesn't have
psychotropic properties.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a baby plant to plant with.
[SPEAKER_13]: So even starting at that base level,
politicians and the general public don't
[SPEAKER_13]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why you hear this stuff about
toaster butt and all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_13]: and kids are going to be grabbing their
parents' plants and eating it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really where we have to start.
[SPEAKER_13]: We laugh when we hear what happened with
the conservative government when they
[SPEAKER_13]: brought this up at second reading,
but this is really serious.
[SPEAKER_13]: I find, again, with people knowing my
position on cannabis, and I talk to people
[SPEAKER_13]: who knew me through law school,
and they're now parents and have children,
[SPEAKER_13]: and I say to them, well, would you rather
have your child downing a kinkie of vodka
[SPEAKER_13]: or have a little couple of pasta at a
joint, they still will turn to the alcohol
[SPEAKER_13]: because they know of that one guy in high
school that started smoking weed and that
[SPEAKER_13]: was it.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a burnout, quit school,
and did all these things and said,
[SPEAKER_13]: oh God, okay, let's take it back.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably the fact that this fellow
was a lazy person in the first place.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could have been any substance.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could have been cigarettes or coffee,
for God's sake.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I find is just a lot of it
because we get too entrenched in this and
[SPEAKER_13]: we tend to forget.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also find that the education process is
bringing real-world examples to the table.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my favorites that really,
for some strange reason, really makes
[SPEAKER_13]: politicians go, huh, Rosie, that makes
sense, is when I say to them, look,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, I'm not a big person.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm 5'6", and I'm about 120 pounds,
but I was to sit down and drink two
[SPEAKER_13]: bottles of alcohol, any kind, scotch,
herbal scotch, I'd be throwing up,
[SPEAKER_13]: but vodka or anything, you know that at
the least, I'm going to end up in the
[SPEAKER_13]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the most, I'm going to, I could kill
myself, but if I was to walk down the
[SPEAKER_13]: street, no one is going to stop me from
purchasing five cases of this very product
[SPEAKER_13]: that the government knows will kill me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just kind of say that, and I'm quiet
when I say that, and they just kind of go,
[SPEAKER_13]: huh, they just don't put these real-world
examples together.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why I find, so Hillary,
when you mentioned the task force,
[SPEAKER_13]: that was a big thing, is talking about
what the planet is really like,
[SPEAKER_13]: who are the patients, who are the real
consumers, who are the growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, let's face it, the faces of
cannabis are everyday people, and they've
[SPEAKER_13]: been forced to do this in the underground
because there is no other way to access
[SPEAKER_13]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are, everybody, there are lawyers,
doctors, accountants, trade people,
[SPEAKER_13]: students, everybody, everybody is involved
in this plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So trying to think it's just some little
subculture that is so wrong, and we're
[SPEAKER_13]: here because of consumers.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been pushing this for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been using this product for a very
long time, and today I'm just so excited
[SPEAKER_13]: to finally see it out in the open.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about fricking time is all I have to
say.
[SPEAKER_13]: People used to tell me that I'd never see
this in my lifetime, and I would just
[SPEAKER_13]: laugh.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for me to be working on the forefront
and be able to affect policy has been
[SPEAKER_13]: really exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: So through the work with the Cannabis
Trade Alliance of Canada, for example,
[SPEAKER_13]: is when the Cannabis Act speaks to
licensing classes and breaking that up,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's actually one of our biggest
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm continuing to work at the federal
level to have production broken up,
[SPEAKER_13]: and breaking up productions, we have
different classes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So nurseries, cultivation, processors,
wholesalers, distributors, and retail,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then underlying all of it is
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that you have to go get an
exemption or under the narcotic control
[SPEAKER_13]: regulations to get an authorization to
operate in the lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one dedicated cannabis testing lab
in all of Canada, and the fact that the
[SPEAKER_13]: whole reason that we're going legal is
predicated on the fact that we have to put
[SPEAKER_13]: out safe and tested products to consumers.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's insane to me that we have one
dedicated lab out there doing this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have to have a lot more labs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, that allows for a lot more
cannabis to be tested, a lot more growers
[SPEAKER_13]: to get their product tested.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll help drive the prices down for
testing because that's been creating a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: of backlogs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: So back to breaking up the licensing
categories.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we do that, now this is how we get the
small craft growers in, because now you
[SPEAKER_13]: don't have to create these big facilities
where you have to do seats of sale.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to do it all.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to do it all, you can apply
for all the different classes.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you want to be just a processor,
and that's an area that we work in,
[SPEAKER_13]: not all processors want to be growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to be able to source the best
material that they can in order to make
[SPEAKER_13]: their beautiful extract at the end.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like if you go to the liquor store to
buy a bottle of wine, you purchase a
[SPEAKER_13]: certain bottle of wine because you trust
that grower, that label, or that brand to
[SPEAKER_13]: deliver a nice, consistent product all the
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the end of the day, when that
consumer is buying a product on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_13]: which we really hope is going to be
independent retail and not liquor store
[SPEAKER_13]: distribution, then they trust that that
brand is because that producer,
[SPEAKER_13]: that processor has created the best
genetics possible to create that beautiful
[SPEAKER_13]: product.
[SPEAKER_13]: So whether they grow it themselves or they
source it themselves, it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_13]: matter.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just trust that they have the best
expertise to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Provincially, here in DC, it's been a big
mess, obviously, with the election that's
[SPEAKER_13]: been going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every politician matters now, even the
backbenchers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, it's just getting back to
educating them about the plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: educating them why here in DC that going
to the liquor distribution model is
[SPEAKER_13]: asinine.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a 75-year-old archaic model with two
warehouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: One is up in the northern interior and one
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And warehousing the product is stupid.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 2017.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's technological advances that we can
use, of course, like the metric system,
[SPEAKER_13]: biotrack, and others that are coming
online, which allow the government to tap
[SPEAKER_13]: into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many ways that we can do the
distribution.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just simply handing it over to the BCGU,
selling it in liquor is just, as we all
[SPEAKER_13]: know, just, I think, the worst possible
outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosie.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my long and short.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Comprehensive as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you so much for all the awesome
work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing in Canada, both federally and
provincially, to see that we get some
[SPEAKER_05]: reasonable and wise regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it always feels like we have one win
and then off to the next massive battle.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's never really a break.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's go to Nishi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nishi, I wonder if you can talk to us
a little bit about what legislative
[SPEAKER_05]: education has been like in Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it's been a bit of an uphill
battle for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an understatement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Texas, we do not have a medical
cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a medical cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have something called the Texas
Compassionate Use Act, which some people
[SPEAKER_03]: like to refer to as medical cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's most likely not going to be a
functioning law simply because it uses the
[SPEAKER_03]: word prescribe instead of the word
recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the United States, every state that
has a functioning medical cannabis law,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has to use the word recommend because
when it uses the word prescribed,
[SPEAKER_03]: doctors are at risk for losing their
license to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so educating people about that one
word in that law has been a monumental
[SPEAKER_03]: task.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our law will go into effect on in
September of this year, and it will make
[SPEAKER_03]: it possible for people who have
intractable epilepsy to specialist to say
[SPEAKER_03]: that they've tried everything else and
that this is kind of their last chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they can actually get access to CBD
only oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an incredibly restrictive law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're trying to do with Texas
Normal and MPP through a coalition that
[SPEAKER_03]: has been created of 26 different pro
cannabis education and advocacy
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call ourselves Texans for Responsible
Marijuana Policy is that we are trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: do two things at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one is to educate lawmakers about
the safety and efficacy of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: then to do the same with the general
public so that they can be powered by
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful advocates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what we've found is that it's
really the constituents educated,
[SPEAKER_03]: well-spoken constituents who have the
courage to go to their lawmakers and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: I need this medicine for my child,
for my parent, for my spouse, for myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year we had a comprehensive
medical bill that would have expanded the
[SPEAKER_03]: Texas Compassionate Health Care Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have included access to THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have included access to herb and
other cannabinoid therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would have made it possible for the
conversation to be really between the
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor and the patient, not the patient in
our government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the doctor would get to decide what's
the appropriate ratio of THC, CBD or any
[SPEAKER_03]: other cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in our state, this cannot be a
legislative ballot initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually has to go through our
legislature, which meets every other year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the process is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have all these people to educate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to get a hearing and committee
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's got to be put to a vote and
then voted out of committee, go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: calendar committee and then ultimately
scheduled on the House floor and then it's
[SPEAKER_03]: got to be agreed to on the Senate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a monumental task.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this year, when we had our hearing,
we had over 60 people come out and testify
[SPEAKER_03]: about how and why cannabis was so
important to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was such passionate testimony that
we ended up with 81 House members signed
[SPEAKER_03]: on as co-sponsors of this legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for us, ultimately cannabis is now
a mainstream issue as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The legislation did get voted out of
committee, but unfortunately was not
[SPEAKER_03]: scheduled in time to be heard and voted on
the House floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 150 members of our House.
[SPEAKER_03]: 81 of them showed up in support of the
bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I feel like that was two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, our educational efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really are working, but more importantly,
educating the voters so that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out to their legislators has seemed
to be the most effective piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that we did that really
worked this year is leadership of Texas
[SPEAKER_03]: for Responsible marijuana policy created a
educational exhibit in the House that was
[SPEAKER_03]: staffed by two people from eight to five
foreign citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all about the facts associated
with the safety of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And had a lot of old school lawmakers and
lobbyists and law enforcement come up and
[SPEAKER_03]: say that what you're doing is really
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oddly enough, nowhere in any of our
education were there any pictures of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis or the conservative nature of our
state that has been a barrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we take out the leaf and we take
out the flower and using red, white and
[SPEAKER_03]: blue and just information and graphs for
whatever reason, it makes it possible for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to, I think it reduces the fear
factor and opens them to receiving the
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it so sad that this beautiful plant
and its beautiful leaves and its beautiful
[SPEAKER_09]: structure has been something that has been
completely demonized when, if you ever get
[SPEAKER_09]: an opportunity to look at her closely,
she is the most beautiful creature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like truly, if you take a scope and look
at her, she's just radiant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can- And also the demonization of PhD
is really what came up for me listening to
[SPEAKER_05]: you too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I've got feedback somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is, you know, like we, you know,
I think there's a tendency to treat THC
[SPEAKER_05]: like the badass stepsister who's like,
you know, in a leather jacket smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: cigarettes behind the high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a metaphor that it's not mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: This came from bubble men, you know,
and CBD is like on the honor roll and on
[SPEAKER_05]: the student's council and is like
polishing its halo, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we really have held up
CBD as look, you can have this amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutic effect without this terrible
molecule that's gonna give you all the
[SPEAKER_05]: euphoric effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, as patient advocates and as
educators, I think it's just such an
[SPEAKER_05]: important thing and that we always have to
catch constantly because otherwise you're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna see the evolution of legislation
like what you're facing where patients are
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna have access to CBD oil, but we know
perfectly well that CBD by itself does not
[SPEAKER_05]: have all the therapeutic effects that it
has when it gets to work with its
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful sister THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I have to really
question if these patients are even gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have access to CBD because I wonder how
many doctors are really gonna step up and
[SPEAKER_03]: take the risk to prescribe versus
recommend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Sarah, you wanna speak to this a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of very much in your
wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to actually because I'm working
for Project CBD as the name suggests,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we focus a lot on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were one of the first organizations
to bring attention to it as the new story
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD's reemergence in the grassroots
cannabis supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was very interesting at the time
when it was reemerging in the supply and
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming accessible to people because at
first people were saying, oh, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't get you high, no one's gonna
want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, very quickly that
changed and now we can all see that CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the limelight and it's kind of like,
you're describing, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times people demonize THC and it's the bad
compound and CBD is the good compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're having to constantly do work
surrounding this because like we've
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that CBD and THC work best in
combination with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not just about CBD and
THC, it's about terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in the cannabis plant that we
have yet to discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think this dialogue is very
important to have an ongoing conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: about as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing legislation within the
United States and in any other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Europe, it's very common
to see that hemp-derived products are
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and they'll have THC limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CBD is okay, but THC under .3 or I
think it's Switzerland, it's 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are always talking about how
patients need access to a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is gonna become increasingly
important because, you know, sometimes for
[SPEAKER_00]: people a CBD only preparation can kind of
get them in the door, but generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, many people are gonna have to
have options and the capabilities to have
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we feel that CBD only laws do not
adequately support the patient population
[SPEAKER_00]: in that respect.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the pieces I just wanted to add
quickly was I think part of the stigma
[SPEAKER_09]: around the term THC is the idea that it's
psychoactive and that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: or CBD, sorry, cannabidiol is somehow not.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the panelists that's been here
before, Joy Beckerman, at the ICBC
[SPEAKER_09]: conference in Vancouver shared a really
beautiful piece that I've taken to heart,
[SPEAKER_09]: that CBD absolutely is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does change neurochemistry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does change brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does affect somebody's mood.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even just taking away the word
psychoactive and replacing it with
[SPEAKER_09]: euphoric I think can be another way that
we can positively impact the language
[SPEAKER_09]: shift that's happening right now around
THC and taking away that sting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you and I think we have to be
careful because I think sometimes the
[SPEAKER_05]: effects of THC are more than euphoric when
you get into some of the really negative
[SPEAKER_05]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so particularly if you're,
you know, like if you're taking somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: brand new to cannabis or seniors,
which I know you're passionate about,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I think that I think we have to
be careful by only saying euphoria,
[SPEAKER_05]: it can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But around CBD having psychoactive
effects, CBD gets my dog so stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he had a, he went through a major
surgery about six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an amazing 110 pound big beautiful
black bear of a dog who's napping around
[SPEAKER_05]: here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after his surgery, we started using
CBD on the advice of his canine rehab
[SPEAKER_05]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, like I said, he's 110 pounds and I
know how to start low and go slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started him with a half a milliliter
of the CBD oil that I have, which is only
[SPEAKER_05]: three milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So three milligrams of CBD for 110 pounds
should be a really small dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gets these like really heavy
eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_05]: He kind of looks like a cartoon character.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he gets this, like if he was like a
cartoon character, a cartoon character of
[SPEAKER_05]: a stoned dog would be what his face looks
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gets like, oh, like stretchy,
snuggly, like somebody who is getting
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can like lower the dose even still
in my little syringe, but even like a
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram and a half, like the tiniest
amount of CBD, his endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_05]: must just be really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it definitely helps with inflammation
if we've had a big rehab session.
[SPEAKER_05]: And helps him to sleep well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I definitely see CBD having
psychoactive or euphoric effects on my
[SPEAKER_05]: dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there were some other
people that wanted to say some things
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis and animals.
[SPEAKER_16]: Before we go there, I just want to
introduce Wendy.
[SPEAKER_16]: She just popped in.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Wendy Turner, hi.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice to see you today.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Wendy's done a few epic Hash Church
episodes.
[SPEAKER_16]: The last one we did together was five
hours long.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very, very informative.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Wendy is the mother of Colton Turner.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he is a Crohn's patient who uses
cannabis to manage his disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Colton started using cannabis I
believe when he was 13.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wendy can tell us all a little bit more
about this.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I actually, before we go into pets,
I want to just bring the conversation back
[SPEAKER_16]: to THC versus CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: One being the good guy, one being the bad
guy.
[SPEAKER_16]: And talk a little bit about the importance
of medical THC and its applications for
[SPEAKER_16]: children in pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because a lot of times we hear a lot about
CBD and how it can be used for childhood
[SPEAKER_16]: epilepsy and other conditions.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we forget about THC and there's a lot
of stigma especially on that for children
[SPEAKER_16]: use.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Wendy can speak to some experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: Colton uses a one to one CBD THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_16]: So welcome Wendy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Please have the floor for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi guys, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear me?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Colton is 17 now and he started
using cannabis when he was 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really started getting into cannabis
when he was 14 because that's when we
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would have to say absolutely that it
is so important to use THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Colton at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pediatric use of cannabis is
getting more popular and there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding coming through the more
research that we do with these kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's kind of crazy that
people are like, oh well you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get him high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's scary because he's been on all
these other pharmaceuticals and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like yeah, but morphine gave him a
really, really high, high, really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I don't see where the
pediatric use is so, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's not give this to kids when it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it really worked for Colton.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been in remission for three years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, just to start and
interrupt for a sec, especially when we
[SPEAKER_16]: compare it to the drugs and the compounds
that a lot of these kids are on.
[SPEAKER_16]: So with Colton and again with other kids
for Crohn's and colitis, inflammatory
[SPEAKER_16]: bowel disease, a lot of the drugs these
kids go on are other immunomodulators,
[SPEAKER_16]: things that suppress the immune system,
corticosteroids, anti-TNF, alpha blockers.
[SPEAKER_16]: These drugs can be used, some of them
short term, some of them long term.
[SPEAKER_16]: They work for some people.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for instance, with TNF alpha blockers,
there's a lot of side effects,
[SPEAKER_16]: things like steroids.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's major side effects.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those can only be used short term.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so for a lot of these kids,
they even lose responsiveness to anti-TNF
[SPEAKER_16]: blockers.
[SPEAKER_16]: So even if they work for a little bit,
they might stop working.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what happens is a lot of these patients
are just left with there's no hope.
[SPEAKER_16]: Up to 70% of patients with Crohn's disease
require surgery at least once during the
[SPEAKER_16]: course of disease.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the quality of life can be very
limiting.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so cannabis is amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know, Wendy, you really emphasize,
which I think is an important message
[SPEAKER_16]: also, that cannabis is not a cure for
Crohn's disease, but it is helpful for
[SPEAKER_16]: symptom management.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it can keep disease in remission.
[SPEAKER_16]: But as soon as Colton stops taking his
medicine, his disease symptoms come back.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, you can talk a little bit more
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like, oh, it cured him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cured him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cured him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely 100% did not cure his
Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he stops taking his medicine,
he goes back into a flare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crohn's disease is sometimes a hereditary
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not exactly sure where Crohn's
disease comes from, why it was triggered,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if it's a DNA issue, or if it's
something that is environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many questions about Crohn's
disease that have been gone unanswered for
[SPEAKER_01]: so many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, oh, it cured him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know if it's because it's a
hereditary thing in him, because my
[SPEAKER_01]: brother also has UC, or if it is
environmental, because his trigger was a
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when he stopped taking his medicine
for about a week, when we went back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Illinois to visit family, because he
hadn't been around family or around
[SPEAKER_01]: friends for a year, a little over a year
after we had moved to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were afraid that he was going
to get sick again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up with a flare.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up with an ulcer that came up
just as quick as his Crohn's disease did,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to put him back on cannabis and
get him saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the endocannabinoid system just
immediately washes him completely out as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as he stops taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to get him back into full
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's absolutely not a cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with his symptom relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also has to deal with his diet
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of factors when it comes
to all this.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Wendy, can you tell us a little bit
more about dosing?
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you had talked previously about
trying some different combos.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know in the epilepsy kids,
sometimes when they give really high dose
[SPEAKER_16]: of CBD, some side effects can actually be
diarrhea and can be loss of appetite.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that can be a concern with Crohn's and
colitis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And someone's also asking, Anisha wanted
to know if Colton's grades improved and
[SPEAKER_16]: his school attendance improved after he
started taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grade situation has always been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colton is extremely smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's homeschooled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the poor kid, I felt bad for him
because when he was really, really sick,
[SPEAKER_01]: he still had to go to school because he
could still sit going to the bathroom with
[SPEAKER_01]: his computer on his lap and get his
schoolwork done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we never had that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's an extremely smart kid anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that since he's been on cannabis,
his personalities came out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to be really shy and introverted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you've seen him on
stage, you totally know now that he is not
[SPEAKER_01]: an introvert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brought something else out in him
that we've never, ever seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a totally different kid on cannabis
than he is without it or on the TNFA
[SPEAKER_01]: blockers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to dosing, of course,
everybody knows that everyone is
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little girl named Marlee who
came to Colorado from Maryland that has
[SPEAKER_01]: almost the same symptoms as Colton.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has severe Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her dosing is a little bit different
than Colton's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colton does get high on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have a euphoric instrument for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he takes 15 milligrams of CBD and 15
milligrams of THC per dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he takes those doses four times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Marlee is at about a 10 milligram
dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's, you know, Crohn's
disease is different in everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the dosing is different for
everyone too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to figure out what's right
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do feel that with all the Crohn's
patients that we've seen that using a pill
[SPEAKER_01]: form, other than ingesting it through a
pill, is a little bit better on their
[SPEAKER_01]: system than smoking or just using
sublingual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen more positive results using
that ingestion method than any other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just because it goes down
into the gut and, you know, bypasses the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really opening CB2 receptors and
not CB1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you using an enteric-coated pill?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: He uses a vegan pill from Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it oil or tincture?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: He uses safflower oil, which is another
thing that I should probably say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've noticed that if you use coconut oil,
with these kids that have Crohn's disease
[SPEAKER_01]: or even adults, that they have more
diarrhea because coconut oil can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: as like a, I can't even think of the word.
[SPEAKER_07]: A laxative.
[SPEAKER_01]: A laxative, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use safflower oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of omega-3s and omega-6s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be a good fatty oil for
the cannabis to attach to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, the only other thing that
we worry about is THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoid THCV is really bad for
people that have wasting syndromes because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's great for losing weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to lose weight or if you had
diabetes or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But THCV in a kid or an adult with Crohn's
disease is not the greatest cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to take.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Wendy, I wanted to ask, when you guys
are getting Colton's medicine,
[SPEAKER_16]: do you get it analyzed to know what
percentage of cannabinoids in it?
[SPEAKER_16]: And is there any analysis about other
terpenes or terpenoids or other residual
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabinoids that might be in that blend?
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is it just THC, CBD isolated that
they're combining?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always gotten the lab results in all
of Colton's medicine to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're giving him the right doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, his medicine now is an isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he only has CBD and THC in his pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have any terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have anything else than just
those two cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have it tested to make sure that
there's no microbials and residuals and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have these medicines tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for one, if we don't know what
we're putting in our system, then how do
[SPEAKER_01]: we know if it's working or what is
working?
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, that's just the safe way to go.
[SPEAKER_16]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you guys experimented at all with any
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some interesting work done,
especially with limonene.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the monoterpene found in the
surface of orange peel and lime.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you break into an orange,
that really fresh citrus smell you're
[SPEAKER_16]: smelling.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's limonene or limonin, depending on
how you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's some animal studies anyway
with colitis models where they take oral
[SPEAKER_16]: doses of limonene extracted from orange
peel.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they take it orally as a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't remember what the exact dose is.
[SPEAKER_16]: But just that compound alone can suppress
inflammation and help with some of the
[SPEAKER_16]: ulcerations.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you have contact with your person
making you some supplements, that might be
[SPEAKER_16]: a good compound to add to your formula,
especially because it's already found
[SPEAKER_16]: naturally in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it does have some synergistic activity
with the cannabinoids anyway, or
[SPEAKER_16]: presumably.
[SPEAKER_16]: That hasn't necessarily been shown in
science yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyone who consumes those compounds
with cannabinoids definitely can feel
[SPEAKER_16]: those effects.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, just wondering if you've played
around with any kind of terpenes or
[SPEAKER_16]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting ready to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to make sure that we had the
right cannabinoids before we start using
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at developing an AM and PM
formulation for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he is tired all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, cannabis makes you tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Crohn's disease makes you tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has a double whammy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely want to start using some
terpenes to help with those little bitty
[SPEAKER_01]: things that he's dealing with,
the tiredness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's tired, but he can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely wanting to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the terpenes and making sure that the
cannabinoids are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to add them one by one by one.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, I always love hearing your
updates and that Colton's still doing
[SPEAKER_16]: well.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you so much for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, we're going to change up the
topic a little bit and bring it back to
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis for pets.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, Hilary, if you want to take the
lead.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know you were telling about your own
dog, Ringo, and how he's been using
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis to help with his treatment.
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you want to tell us a little bit
about why he's using cannabis and even
[SPEAKER_16]: what's?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's on an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the surgery that he had,
he ripped his anterior ligament.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the ligament that came from him were
from sliding out over to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a big surgery.
[SPEAKER_05]: They take the leg apart and reshape the
top of the bone and the bottom of the bone
[SPEAKER_05]: and then plate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's on a leash for 20 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: No freedom for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a slow, long recovery to kind of
rebuild all of the muscle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the rehab therapist first,
like first after his surgery, he had a
[SPEAKER_05]: epidural.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was coming off of his anesthetic and he
had a fentanyl pain patch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for a week he was pretty whacked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have preferred to have been able
to control the opiate and maybe start
[SPEAKER_05]: using some cannabinoids at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because it was a patch, it was just
going to do its thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't, I didn't want to just take it
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't use any cannabis in the first
week when it was like sort of the most
[SPEAKER_05]: acute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it started coming up was his
rehab therapist suggested to use CBD and
[SPEAKER_05]: she brought it up, not me, because he was
starting to feel a bit better and was
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to bounce around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wanted to like play and romp and be
hectic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a crisis happened in my best friend's
family and I really needed to go and be
[SPEAKER_05]: present and also take care of the dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was like, well, just why don't you
give him some CBD and see if it mellows
[SPEAKER_05]: him out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it'll help with inflammation and
he'll, he won't be bouncing around so
[SPEAKER_05]: much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was when I started with a really,
what I thought would be a micro dose that
[SPEAKER_05]: he wouldn't even feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I thought three milligrams,
210 pounds of dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it really, he really feels it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it totally worked to turn him
into mellow, stoned, cartoon, sleepy,
[SPEAKER_05]: snuggly dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my personal experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my Compassion Club has been
distributing cannabis to pets for quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time for seizures and pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people wanting to try to do tumor
management with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, but right now it's, it's a
helpful tool for MyRingo for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Sarah, you had, you mentioned you had
just written an article about cannabis for
[SPEAKER_16]: pets in one of the recent Project CBD
posts.
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you want to tell us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I wrote recently about this topic
because I felt that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's become increasingly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask us about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wanted to get to the root of
it with a veterinarian because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as there is a need to educate the doctor,
the human doctor population, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: even bigger need to educate the veterinary
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so luckily there's a veterinarian
based in California, Dr. Gary Richter,
[SPEAKER_00]: who does, has done a lot of work with
cannabinoids in his practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, that's basically where we're at
with it because, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's based on reports like the one you
just gave, but you know, the pet owners
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it a try for their animals or it's,
you know, a few veterinarians that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be working with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there hasn't been really any animal
focused studies in dogs and cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's maybe been two in dogs and
I haven't seen any in cats as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: horses or others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an area that we definitely need
research, but you know, fortunately or
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately there's more research being
done in humans, but as we know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're just, I guess the
importance of using these patient
[SPEAKER_00]: testimonies and speak for the animals
because they obviously can't and how
[SPEAKER_00]: important that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one concern I have with that aspect of
products for pets is just the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of regulation that there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, you know, a lot of times over
the internet, you can order CVD product
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have no idea what's being put into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, for anyone that would be
potentially dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wonder if anyone has any,
like the kind of legal gray area and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that translates into product quality where
you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know for, I'm getting a feedback.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know for us, we have worked directly
with cats, dogs, horses, just trying to,
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah, just trying to help with symptom
management primarily or a palliation for
[SPEAKER_09]: us in order to get a quality product
within our organization.
[SPEAKER_09]: We lab test everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We make our own medicines ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have the same concern that you do,
Sarah, where it's, we're really in the
[SPEAKER_09]: wild west and people are putting names on
products for anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even things that are being sold as,
you know, just CVD, who really knows?
[SPEAKER_09]: And where are they getting that base?
[SPEAKER_09]: Product from, are they lab testing it
through who is it an accredited lab?
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they done trials with this product
before they put it on the market?
[SPEAKER_09]: In my experience, working on other
dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within our own organization, we do our due
diligence to make sure that we're lab
[SPEAKER_09]: testing everything and that we can provide
a lab test with that product if we need
[SPEAKER_09]: to, to ensure that it's quality and safety
for the end user.
[SPEAKER_09]: In regards to just pet use in general,
I found that people are more comfortable
[SPEAKER_09]: allowing their pet to use cannabis than
themselves, where they're more open or
[SPEAKER_09]: more accepting of their dog with arthritic
pain using the drops instead of
[SPEAKER_09]: themselves, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that that will shift.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wonder if it's also part of just
human nature seems to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_09]: compassionate towards animals than they
are towards our own species.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like cannabis can be really helpful
to a lot of animals in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_09]: ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Hillary, just to echo what you were
saying about your dog there, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: a small, small dose can have a very huge
effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, just this idea that you can just
buy a dog biscuit with five milligrams of
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD in it and just have that be the
standard recommended dose for that animal,
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think is realistic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we could potentially harm
our furry friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just being mindful of that and taking a
similar approach to our human populations,
[SPEAKER_09]: slow and slow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think like similar to what we do
with humans around like connecting with
[SPEAKER_15]: compounding pharmacies so that if a
certain dosage where the and that's where
[SPEAKER_15]: the medication comes standard doesn't
work, then there are different avenues out
[SPEAKER_15]: there where you can compound something so
it's more in tune to the needs of your
[SPEAKER_15]: pet.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're not necessarily just needing to
do what the standard dosage is.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think like there's pharmacies that
are getting to be more open to compounding
[SPEAKER_15]: for pets and for people.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's an important aspect or
avenue to think of in terms of making sure
[SPEAKER_15]: that the dosage is absolutely perfect for
humans and pets.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want to experiment on your
animal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to comment quickly, Andrea here
on the side of using hemp as part of
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis with pets is that we've seen
really amazing profiles going on right now
[SPEAKER_11]: with animal trials, especially on the side
of chicken feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now in Canada, it's actually easier
to get something into the hemp as a food
[SPEAKER_11]: for human consumption than it is as hemp
as a livestock feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have run through the Canadian Hemp
Trade Alliance in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_11]: University of Manitoba the principle
trials to look at hemp as a chicken feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the great things coming out of
those tests is that we've found that it's
[SPEAKER_11]: very comparable to flax.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're seeing a lot of flax in eggs
or in the rations fed to the chickens
[SPEAKER_11]: laying the eggs.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is how we're getting these omega
eggs.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really good, but it takes a lot of
money and a lot of time and expertise to
[SPEAKER_11]: tweeze through all of the regulations as
it comes to getting something registered
[SPEAKER_11]: as a livestock feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the side of looking at hemp as a pet
food, we're actually having a pretty big
[SPEAKER_11]: pushback from the Association of Animal
Feeds out of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've actually put up and really
sort of in a sense banned hemp as a pet
[SPEAKER_11]: food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although the supplementary side of the pet
food industry has accepted hemp as a pet
[SPEAKER_11]: supplement.
[SPEAKER_11]: So through the Hemp Industries
Association, there now is campaign and a
[SPEAKER_11]: group of people coming together to
actually work with the Association for
[SPEAKER_11]: Feed Controls on getting hemp actually
allowed as a pet food.
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately, we just don't have and
like the fact when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana and when I'm discussing,
I'm going to use hemp as hemp and
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana as marijuana or medicinal
cannabis, but hemp and not all in cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's a very confusing term
sometimes when we're trying to sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: disseminate what's hemp and what's
marijuana or medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the side of the hemp side,
you know, we've just really lacked that
[SPEAKER_11]: peer reviewed research that's going to
take us to the next level as it comes to
[SPEAKER_11]: using hemp as a pet food.
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrea, let's talk a little bit more about
what you were saying using hemp as a feed
[SPEAKER_16]: source for animals.
[SPEAKER_16]: So with the you're working, is it with Dr.
Jim House?
[SPEAKER_16]: At the University of Manitoba?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so when they feed these chickens,
the hemp feed, it improves the nutritional
[SPEAKER_16]: composition of the egg, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like it improves the fatty acid profile
similar to, I mean, you can already buy
[SPEAKER_16]: omega-3 pumped up eggs and other things
like that in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know there's eggs where they feed
chickens, things like flax seed oil or
[SPEAKER_16]: sorry, maybe it's just flax.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure it's the flax seed meal or
the flax seed oil, but they feed the hemp
[SPEAKER_16]: and the diet to improve the fatty acid
profile so that you can get a boost of
[SPEAKER_16]: beneficial omega-3 fatty acids in the
eggs.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what's really cool about the hemp
nutrition is it's doing that and also not
[SPEAKER_16]: even, not just improving the nutrition of
the animal, but improving the nutrition of
[SPEAKER_16]: the end consumer, i.e.
[SPEAKER_16]: the people who would be consuming the eggs
and the chicken.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they also looking at the composition
of the profile of the chicken meat or are
[SPEAKER_16]: they just focused on the eggs?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now principally it's eggs,
but they are so are looking at broilers
[SPEAKER_11]: and this isn't just about what comes out
in the egg as a nutritional profile,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's also a huge amount of work going
into sensory work.
[SPEAKER_11]: How does the egg smell?
[SPEAKER_11]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it change color?
[SPEAKER_11]: All of these kinds of things have to go
into that research.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is work that's been ongoing with
Dr. Jim House really from the first bit of
[SPEAKER_11]: that research actually looked at like
protein digestibility and they have looked
[SPEAKER_11]: at hemp oil and hemp seed so those have
been the two principles and they've of
[SPEAKER_11]: course had controls and treatments
happening and one of these, one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: papers is the effective feeding hemp seed
and hemp seed oil on laying hens
[SPEAKER_11]: performing in yolk fatty acid content and
evidence of the safety and efficacy for
[SPEAKER_11]: these laying hens.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is the health of the hen also?
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things they said is that
these were some of the happiest hens
[SPEAKER_11]: they've seen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not even just the nutritional
composition of how it's improving their
[SPEAKER_16]: meat, but the animals are actually feeling
better from getting appropriate nutrition.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so do you see in the future using hemp
seed for other animal feeds or even like
[SPEAKER_16]: cattle or bigger animals?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean right now in Canada we're not
allowed or in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: not allowed to use hemp as an animal feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now at the state side there has been some
state legislation passed in Colorado I
[SPEAKER_11]: know for one state that has passed some
legislation wanting to look at hemp as an
[SPEAKER_11]: animal feed and this is when I'm saying
animal feed I'm on the topic of livestock
[SPEAKER_11]: feed and these are things that are going
to go into the human consumption market.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we've actually seen anecdotal or
what we've heard from people that have fed
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp to their animals, I mean myself
personally I feed basically what is what I
[SPEAKER_11]: call hope which is a hemp oil protein
extract and this is the filter that's
[SPEAKER_11]: coming off of the hemp seed oil once it's
filtered down to that one micron.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when they butcher the pigs they just
say the skin comes off the pig so much
[SPEAKER_11]: easier and when you're talking about time
and labor into these pigs and of course my
[SPEAKER_11]: pigs are running around happy in their in
their pig enclosure.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not in gestation tanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not held in small little areas.
[SPEAKER_11]: So whatever we can do to improve that that
pig's health or that cow's health.
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition on the side of cattle what
I've heard from people is it's actually
[SPEAKER_11]: reduced prolapses and this is when the cow
actually pushes out its uterus.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very very common.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a pretty sight and obviously cost
the farmer money to have to deal with how
[SPEAKER_11]: to push these prolapses back and I've seen
them actually put the sugar coat on the
[SPEAKER_11]: prolapse itself and try to push that
prolapse back in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can have a reduction in the
prolapse and also increase not only of the
[SPEAKER_11]: heifer but of the calf itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition if you look at what's coming
out of the equine industry and it's still
[SPEAKER_11]: a very huge huge industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about hoof health and coat
health and that's just on the side of
[SPEAKER_11]: using hemp as a food product not to mind
using hemp as an animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes we absolutely need these but it's
research that has to be done per animal
[SPEAKER_11]: type and per use of that animal.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could get it registered as and for
chicken feed for eggs doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_11]: mean it's going to be registered for
broilers because we have to have all that
[SPEAKER_11]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the side of the chicken feeding
that's really being led by the Canadian
[SPEAKER_11]: Hemp Trade Alliance.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if any of the listeners out there have
some expertise when it comes around to
[SPEAKER_11]: registration of animal feeds please reach
out to your local ag department or to the
[SPEAKER_11]: national associations respectively in your
countries and because really that
[SPEAKER_11]: expertise is something that we're lacking
when it comes to registration.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Andrea.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all really interesting and I'm
excited to hear more.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean I'm from Manitoba also and I did my
nutrition training at the University of
[SPEAKER_16]: Manitoba and they've got a really great
team of researchers there not only doing
[SPEAKER_16]: great research but there's also a nice
collaborative spirit where people really
[SPEAKER_16]: work together and try to get the most they
can out of some of these studies.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that was interesting what you were
saying about cannabis helping with
[SPEAKER_16]: prolapse in cattle.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've personally seen a prolapsed baby or a
cow running around after giving birth and
[SPEAKER_16]: it's if that can be prevented.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean all the insights come out and it's
quite the quite the thing to push that all
[SPEAKER_16]: back in and causes stress for the farmer
causes issues with the health of the
[SPEAKER_16]: cattle.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is a big concern.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so let's use this as a segue to
actually introduce the topic of cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know this keeps coming up in the chat.
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone can wants to start the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh I see Marcia Gilman also saying she's
from Manitoba also Manitoba representing
[SPEAKER_16]: in the house.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean our regular host Marcus
Richardson is also from Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_16]: So very nice very nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's talk a little bit about
pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just around the pregnancy and cannabis
piece I haven't had a personal experience
[SPEAKER_15]: with this but a good friend of mine she
was an armed forces veteran.
[SPEAKER_15]: So she has been diagnosed with severe PTSD
when she came back from her tour.
[SPEAKER_15]: So she was on a ton of medication for her
PTSD from like Zoloft anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_15]: medications and she became pregnant about
a year and a half ago and had a good
[SPEAKER_15]: conversation with the physicians at
Women's Hospital down here and was
[SPEAKER_15]: actually cleared to vape throughout her
entire pregnancy because they thought that
[SPEAKER_15]: that would be a better alternative than
for her to stay on a lot of the
[SPEAKER_15]: medications like the SSRIs that she was
on.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she had an amazing pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Great labor.
[SPEAKER_15]: The baby is beautiful and healthy and I
think it just really speaks to how a she
[SPEAKER_15]: was cleared by her physician.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this wasn't just something that she
experimented with and B it really helped
[SPEAKER_15]: her because she does suffer a lot from
night terrors and just all of the
[SPEAKER_15]: wonderful things that are associated with
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was able to to go through this
process and have a positive outcome at the
[SPEAKER_15]: end of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think for a lot of women who are on
a lot of these medications and for those
[SPEAKER_15]: of us who are either pregnant or thinking
of getting pregnant in the near future
[SPEAKER_15]: it's nice to know that for us there is an
option so that we don't have to continue
[SPEAKER_15]: to be on these medications that could
potentially hurt our children.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just I just want to add I mean really
ideally in pregnancy you want to have
[SPEAKER_06]: women and again I'm not an obstetrician
but you want to have women on as few
[SPEAKER_06]: medications as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's usually the goal but it all comes
down to a risk versus benefit kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the best scenario is to have them
on nothing but if you can't have if that
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't possible then you have to use your
judgment and again in all cases you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to start as low as you can and use
as little as you can.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah and exactly to that point pregnancy
is a delicate time we want to minimize
[SPEAKER_16]: whatever additional things but exactly
like you said harm reduction if women are
[SPEAKER_16]: on other drugs and maybe cannabis can be
used as a replacement or safer then it
[SPEAKER_16]: should definitely be considered or at
least the conversation should happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Where women can get some good advice and
at least I mean there are risks of course
[SPEAKER_16]: with anything and the literature is
showing there may be some issues with
[SPEAKER_16]: birth weight being potentially low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low birth weight babies.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah and but that being said a lot of the
risks that are being blown up or thought
[SPEAKER_16]: to be issues the research anyway is not
quite showing that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing that keeps coming up is the
low birth weight complication.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah so I think that's interesting to
know.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is that the problem is when
you're talking about pregnancy and babies
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's an incredibly sort of litigious
area and it's extraordinarily delicate and
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody wants to take any chances and we
don't have enough research yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have enough science yet and the
level of evidence that you need in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of drugs and pregnancy is extraordinary
has to be extraordinarily strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know you can't across the board at
this point condone the use of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_06]: pregnancy and I don't think anybody is but
again as I'm coming back to as as it is in
[SPEAKER_06]: the case of pediatrics when it comes down
to at the end of the day is a risk versus
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit ratio and you have to weigh that
very carefully in each case and then
[SPEAKER_06]: decide whether the risks of using cannabis
and and yes there may well be some risks
[SPEAKER_06]: do they outweigh the harms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and like individual in each case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah and even like the story I was telling
like the for the amount of medication that
[SPEAKER_15]: she was on it was the benefit was getting
off of that medication instead vaping
[SPEAKER_15]: instead because if she stayed on all the
medication the effects on the baby
[SPEAKER_15]: probably would have been so much worse
than what there was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I able to just provide a quick
practical example of of just reducing the
[SPEAKER_09]: harm and using cannabis during pregnancy?
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of women experience nausea,
vomiting, unable to eat, unable to get
[SPEAKER_09]: enough caloric intake for themselves and
that baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in certain circumstances vaporizing is
probably more preferred than smoking but
[SPEAKER_09]: just as a practical example.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it comes to the hemp side of
incorporating hemp into especially on the
[SPEAKER_11]: diet side as you're saying a lot of women
do suffer from nausea so what they do eat
[SPEAKER_11]: they end up losing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the nice thing about ingesting hemp and
especially you know a very common hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: product like Halt Hemp Cedar otherwise
known as hemp hearts commonly on the
[SPEAKER_11]: marketplace you know one of the things
that we know is pregnant women or women
[SPEAKER_11]: seeking that we've got to up our folate.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you're looking at a hundred grams
of hemp hearts you're getting 50% in
[SPEAKER_11]: Canada you're getting about 50% of your
daily intake of folate alone not to mind
[SPEAKER_11]: the magnesium, phosphorus, zinc,
copper, manganese just to name some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: few plus a very highly digestible protein.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're looking around that 95%
digestible protein versus just passing it
[SPEAKER_11]: through the body the body actually uptakes
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then throw in the the short chain
omega-3s and 6s plus the very long super
[SPEAKER_11]: polyunsaturated fats, gemalinoleic and
steridonic acid.
[SPEAKER_11]: GLA for instance is a very rare when it
comes to finding it in a food or culinary
[SPEAKER_11]: oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case this is we can take this
especially if you're looking at people
[SPEAKER_11]: that have vegan or vegetarian diets that
are not taking a fish oil supplement or
[SPEAKER_11]: not consuming foods that have these super
long polyunsaturated fats.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not found, gemalinoleic and
steridonic acid are not found in canola
[SPEAKER_11]: oil, flax oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are found in or grape seed oil or
sunflower oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are found in things like evening
primrose oil and forge oils which you
[SPEAKER_11]: don't typically find in somebody's kitchen
to incorporate into a salad dressing or as
[SPEAKER_11]: a topper on your supper that you're
existing going to serve anyways.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also when it comes to the children
eating those of course as we were shared
[SPEAKER_11]: with is that the amount of research that
goes into getting something approved as a
[SPEAKER_11]: baby food or as a toddler.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been through this with clients that
say oh I want to develop you know a hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: alternative for powdered milk or for you
know for babies or for mothers that can't
[SPEAKER_11]: breastfeed and so they need to have a milk
alternative for their baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is so much clinical work that has to be
done.
[SPEAKER_11]: It becomes very difficult for a single
company to take that type of research on
[SPEAKER_11]: unless we get one of the big huge formula
players in the ball looking at hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when it comes to the sides of the kids
also once again if those kids are being
[SPEAKER_11]: raised on vegetarian vegan diets how do
you get enough protein into their diet?
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you get things like vitamin E?
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we get that calcium in to the diet?
[SPEAKER_11]: And hemp is one of those amazing things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just fun to eat and it can be
incorporated into nut butters.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got that beautiful green color to it
when you put it in your food processor or
[SPEAKER_11]: your Blendtec and you add a little bit of
hemp seed oil there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just another fun way of
incorporating hemp and not only as an
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting food with a very cool flavor
profile but and then backing that with all
[SPEAKER_11]: those nutritional profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great conversation about cannabis
and pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of seems a natural flow to go from
cannabis and pregnancy to talking a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit about cannabis and sex and when I get
together with my lady friends chatting
[SPEAKER_05]: about sex is generally one of the things
that we love to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will get us started if you're all
game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been paying more attention to
cannabis and sexuality recently because my
[SPEAKER_05]: company released a sexual health product
and there's been you know sort of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: lubes and lubricants and all kinds of
cannabis products sort of in the gray
[SPEAKER_05]: market for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh and now my dog's gonna have a spaz
about something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have learned some things recently
that have really kind of blown my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Such as in Canada apparently 40% of women
report to their general practitioner that
[SPEAKER_05]: they are having some kind of sexual
dysfunction at some point in their life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it's lack of arousal, difficulty
achieving orgasm or pain during sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: 40% of women like or this is and this is
adult women.
[SPEAKER_05]: That totally blew my mind and Marcia maybe
you can touch on this a little bit of my
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding is that physicians don't
have a lot of pharmacological tools for
[SPEAKER_05]: women.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a Viagra for women.
[SPEAKER_05]: Celina's saying dryness is one of the
other issues and you know I know that some
[SPEAKER_05]: and again I'm not a doctor but I know that
some physicians will prescribe androgens
[SPEAKER_05]: or like synthetic hormones for women that
I'd love for you to talk about more.
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that the side effect
of them is acne, hair growth, sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: facial hair growth and potentially
aggression.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which those side effects don't sound very
sexy to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just one other thing I want to throw
in before I pass it over to you is that my
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding also is that the last time
that there was any research on cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and sexuality was in the 70s and it was
inhaled cannabis that they were studying
[SPEAKER_05]: and what I thought was super fascinating
about that was that they did note and this
[SPEAKER_05]: was validated survey work but they noted
increased quality of orgasm, increased
[SPEAKER_05]: ability to achieve orgasm and orgasm
frequency and this is for women but also
[SPEAKER_05]: that there was a statistical likelihood of
the increase of snuggling which I love
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Marcia I'll hand it back to you and I
wonder if you can touch a little bit on
[SPEAKER_05]: the lack of pharmacological tools that
physicians have for women's sexual
[SPEAKER_05]: dysfunction issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah there really isn't a whole lot out
there that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean we have estrogen that can address
problems of dryness.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have testosterone that can address some
problems with sort of libido and sense of
[SPEAKER_06]: well-being.
[SPEAKER_06]: The doses have to be kept quite small so
that you can avoid some of the side
[SPEAKER_06]: effects that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also disruptions in lipid profiles
so those have to be followed as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and you know again I don't know that
the results are fantastic in any of these.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that they are in terms of
really boosting libido that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no there isn't that much out there
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not from the pharmaceutical side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody else want to jump in there
have comments about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: sexuality?
[SPEAKER_05]: Natasha I know that you were keen to talk
about cannabis and sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_15]: I just love talking about sex.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean I've just anecdotally heard more
and more about the benefits of like
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis based lubes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So not necessarily like ingesting or
inhaling but just being able to prolong
[SPEAKER_15]: orgasms and just have better sex overall
by using lube topically.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is sort of something that I've
been experimenting with.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know I don't know if anyone has any
like real research information that has
[SPEAKER_15]: come out of this beyond just the
experiential sides of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I know that there's a number of
companies and Foria has come out with
[SPEAKER_15]: something.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think Canopy just purchased what
Foria had come up with.
[SPEAKER_15]: So clearly there's some sort of evidence
behind this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the first thing is that we
need to create this environment where it's
[SPEAKER_15]: comfortable for women to talk about sex
because it's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then also to sort of promote all of
these different products that are out
[SPEAKER_15]: there and how do we use them with like sex
toys or without sex toys just to enhance
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone's experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was mainly what I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Celina, did you look like you had
something to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about sex is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just feel so honored that I get to
share this conversation with my sisters.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think part of this emergence is around
just having a conversation in general,
[SPEAKER_09]: being comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that a lot of people
don't think about when we talk about
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis and sexuality is the healing
side.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we look at statistics in Canada,
for example, one in three women are
[SPEAKER_09]: sexually assaulted in their lifetime,
one in four men.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of people walking around
with trauma that aren't able to have a
[SPEAKER_09]: healthy sexual experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes cannabis in what I've seen
with patients that I've worked with,
[SPEAKER_09]: and also for myself as someone who has
experienced sexual assault, is that it
[SPEAKER_09]: really does help to relax and nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: It helps to ease that anxiety that can
happen around engaging in sexual
[SPEAKER_09]: activities.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, it has the ability to plump
and juice in and get somebody in the flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love when you're talking about,
Hilary, just that beautiful release of
[SPEAKER_09]: endorphin, having that love drug available
to us in a way that's gentle is really
[SPEAKER_09]: important.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the other things I wanted to share
is that just going back to suppositories,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's another way for women to insert
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've talked about lubrication,
sprays, topicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can eat cannabis, you can also insert
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for a lot of women, there are options
out there that we're starting to explore
[SPEAKER_09]: now within this realm, but it's still a
new.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually just wanted to hear from
the rest of the panel, if you've had
[SPEAKER_09]: experiences or if you've worked with
people that have had experiences and what
[SPEAKER_09]: some of those positive take backs have
been.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also worked with people post delivery
and just how much better that experience
[SPEAKER_09]: can be for somebody after they've
delivered a baby and also before,
[SPEAKER_09]: just to prime.
[SPEAKER_09]: So depending on the woman and their
comfort level and making sure that it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: safe environment, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've just seen it be so beneficial in
so many ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think for women too, talking about
sex, being more comfortable with your
[SPEAKER_09]: sexuality.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm a little nervous and sweaty
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't usually share these types of
things on forums that are being publicly
[SPEAKER_09]: broadcast live, so excuse me.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little hot and bothered.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've just noticed that it really opens
up the possibility for more women to have
[SPEAKER_09]: positive sexual experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: For women being more comfortable touching
themselves, not having to feel that
[SPEAKER_09]: they're performing for a partner,
cannabis can really help ease a lot of the
[SPEAKER_09]: psychological aspects of engaging in
sexual experiences as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's a really beautiful thing
that we're starting to finally come full
[SPEAKER_11]: circle And on the side of incorporating
hemp into your diet, oh, pardon me,
[SPEAKER_11]: sorry, Selena.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to say on the side of incorporating
hemp as a food into your diet or hemp seed
[SPEAKER_11]: oil, there's research that has shown the
increase of those essential fatty acids
[SPEAKER_11]: has a function in the production of sperm
and overall health.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's another aspect of incorporating
cannabis into your sexual drive and your
[SPEAKER_11]: sexual desire.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're exhausted, if you're overweight,
if you have poor heart health,
[SPEAKER_11]: the likelihood that you're going to,
even if you want to, the likelihood that
[SPEAKER_11]: you're going to be able to engage in sex
is going to be satisfying to you and your
[SPEAKER_11]: partner.
[SPEAKER_11]: It becomes less and less as your health
goes down.
[SPEAKER_11]: So incorporating hemp just as a health
aspect into what can become part of your
[SPEAKER_11]: sexual being.
[SPEAKER_11]: And nothing sexier than having some ice
cream topped with whole hemp before or
[SPEAKER_11]: after you've had amazing sex.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's another way just to make sex fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to talk a couple of things in
here just from the safety check is one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing to remember is that often
cannabis-based or sexual health products
[SPEAKER_05]: tend to be in coconut oil or other plant
oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't use plant-based oils with latex
condoms or with your latex sex toys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also if you're using a lubricant or a
sexual health product that has THC in it,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you are also engaging in oral sex,
there is the possibility of impairment to
[SPEAKER_05]: be aware of that you may be consuming
enough THC to be impaired.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you actually might want to check where
you're at after said oral sex with
[SPEAKER_05]: THC-based lubes before you get behind the
wheel of a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can jump in here quickly too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not from the medical perspective but
just from people coming to me because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cannabis industry and so people are
always asking and now more and more women
[SPEAKER_02]: are asking about cannabis and sexual
health.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we see now more women opening up to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have women in peri-menopausal and
menopausal times of their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have issues, I mean there's a lot
of psychological issues that come into
[SPEAKER_02]: play.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the physicality of it,
how it feels so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for women especially as we know,
it's all about your mindset and how good
[SPEAKER_02]: you're feeling is how it's going to make
you respond sexually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think as great as the topicals are in
everything, but also ingesting it and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting your head space where you feel
confident and positive and sexy,
[SPEAKER_02]: that all goes to that whole state of
being.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when we have women who are getting
older, they're having issues with dryness,
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, lower back pain, even pain during
sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, ingesting the cannabis is just so
important and helpful to the whole sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, we also have so many people that
are medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dealing with depression,
anxiety, PTSD issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are having a hard time
transitioning off of those drugs into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis only therapies and hopefully one
day we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact remains that when they are on
these hard pharmaceuticals, it is
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting their serotonin levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't assume to speak to the medical
side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know it affects their ability to
get into that sexual space because these
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs are horrible to their bodies and
mechanics of the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, consuming the cannabis helps
those people as well get into that right
[SPEAKER_02]: sexual space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's just so important and
the more we have this out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: just the happier and blessed and great
everyone is going to feel all around
[SPEAKER_02]: sexually and otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a couple more things I want to add
in, but not if anybody else wants to say
[SPEAKER_05]: something because I've had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a couple of thoughts just building
on what Rosie said that for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: the most helpful part is turning off the
rat race in my brain, the part of my brain
[SPEAKER_05]: that's constantly thinking, planning,
strategizing, list making, even when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're trying to be present with a lover.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also I think when it comes to our
sexuality, it's important not to look at
[SPEAKER_05]: anything, including cannabis, as a quick
fix.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if our sexuality is not feeling easily
accessible, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it may be that cannabis
could be the perfect sexual supplement to
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of help you sink into your sensual
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know for me recently, I kind of
experienced some caregiver burnout,
[SPEAKER_05]: had pretty major crises with two of my
best friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just in super caregiver mode and
my sexuality kind of like disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, hello, where are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And just smoking or consuming some
cannabis doesn't really do it for being a
[SPEAKER_05]: quick fix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I needed to talk to my therapist and
get some exercise and get some sleep and
[SPEAKER_05]: like get my own energy kind of moving
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also have to confess something,
which is that the fella that I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: dating, the guy in my life, I have
discovered that when he's high during the
[SPEAKER_05]: day and I'm not, I'm kind of turned off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's just about not being on
the same page and on the same level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of like one thing that we've
had to talk about a bunch is I prefer if
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to consume cannabis that we do
it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I find that yeah, if he's baked
during the day and I'm not, I'm not that
[SPEAKER_05]: turned on by him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And poor guy, so false advertising.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, come on, I'm dating this woman
who's like whole life is about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and I get stoned and you're not turned on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, that's not fair, but that's just
a little something.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my life that I've been navigating to
and around men and sexuality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not a doctor, but some of the
sort of sexual experts in my life,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been talking about, like I've been
curious about cannabis and erectile
[SPEAKER_05]: dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I have been told, and again,
Marcia, maybe I'll pass this over to you
[SPEAKER_05]: as a resident physician on the panel is
that cannabis can be great for men with
[SPEAKER_05]: erectile dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the issue is psychologically based,
but potentially not if it's actually
[SPEAKER_05]: physiologically based.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if you have any comments
about cannabis and pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think you're right on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a physiological basis,
it's a question of blood flow and cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: is not going to overcome that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where medications like Viagra
come into play.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's psychological, again, haven't seen
any studies yet, but I can't see why it
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't help just based on what we
already know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, not to mention the fact that
there's an enhancement of sensory
[SPEAKER_06]: experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, again, I'm a palliative care
doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a specialist in any respect on
erectile dysfunction or men's health,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm just putting in my two cents
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else want to jump in on anything
about your last thoughts about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and sexuality?
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a quick question to follow up with
Andrea on the penis part.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it is physiological, do you think that
eating lots of hemp seed could help
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially remediate an issue or even
prevent it from happening in the first
[SPEAKER_09]: place?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's about looking at that
essential fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, you know, heard from men in
particular that had a very, had an
[SPEAKER_11]: imbalance of those essential fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And once they got that balance back,
all kinds of things started to change in
[SPEAKER_11]: them, whether or not they were,
you know, angry or, you know, or like
[SPEAKER_11]: really sort of crude when it comes to
sexuality or didn't have any sexual drive
[SPEAKER_11]: and then got that essential fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not only just about
consuming, but it's also about your
[SPEAKER_11]: health.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you getting exercise out there and how
do you incorporate that into our cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: use, incorporating exercise, diet,
and cannabis use, whether that be medical
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana, medicinal cannabis,
or hemp as a food.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, there is that research out there,
but once again, you know, to be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: make those kinds of claims, you've got to
have substantial peer reviewed research on
[SPEAKER_11]: not just, not just looking at essential
fatty acids, the mega threes, the sixes,
[SPEAKER_11]: the shorts, and the long chains,
but on the impact at the end.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I can't say for say that,
you know, we've had any of those showing
[SPEAKER_11]: that, you know, oh, if I consume this much
hemp seed oil, this is how my sperm count
[SPEAKER_11]: goes up.
[SPEAKER_11]: But just anecdotally, when I've seen
people either use, you know, marijuana or
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp and incorporate that in, they feel
better.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they feel better about themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this one of the things that we've
discussed, not only from the women's side,
[SPEAKER_11]: feeling better about our own selves and
our own bodies, but men also feeling
[SPEAKER_11]: better about themselves and their bodies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my personal experience,
you know, being with somebody that was
[SPEAKER_11]: overweight, very unhealthy, lots of white
bread and baloney kind of scenario that
[SPEAKER_11]: would just sweat profusely during sex.
[SPEAKER_11]: And who wants to be like a waterfall,
unless you're under a waterfall,
[SPEAKER_11]: who wants to be water falled on while
you're having sex with somebody where you
[SPEAKER_11]: feel like you need to have a rag to wipe
their face.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once they get the diet and some
exercise and the weight control under,
[SPEAKER_11]: all of a sudden these things start to
dissipate.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, honestly, reducing the amount of
alcohol that one is consuming.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that that can also have a
substantial benefit on your sexual drive
[SPEAKER_11]: and your longevity in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we all know as ladies and
men, the longer and stronger, the better.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not just talking about length in
this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about time and attention to
detail and whether or not that attention
[SPEAKER_11]: to detail allows you as consuming medical
marijuana to maybe slow down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And realize what's happening and actually
feel the sensation versus just wham,
[SPEAKER_11]: bam, thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can make a big difference when it comes
to your overall desire to be with that
[SPEAKER_11]: person again.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've seen those both personally and
from speaking with my other male and
[SPEAKER_11]: female friends as it comes to marijuana
and hemp consumption for the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I've noticed is
with cannabis use, especially when your
[SPEAKER_09]: partner is also engaged at the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Hillary, just to share a little bit
more after you had shared about your
[SPEAKER_09]: partner engaging with some cannabis use
during the day and you not really feel it.
[SPEAKER_09]: In my experience, when my partner and I,
you know, smoke a joint together and then
[SPEAKER_09]: become intimate, I find that the
sensuality is enhanced a lot more.
[SPEAKER_09]: The connectivity, even, you know,
in some terms or the thought of telepathy,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we seem to understand each other
without communicating verbally,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my experience, it's been something
where cannabis has helped to enhance that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's necessary, but it's
something where you can have a deeper,
[SPEAKER_09]: it allows you to open and it allows you to
engage in a deeper connection with
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody if that's what you're intending.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think intention is also a really big
part of engaging with cannabis in this
[SPEAKER_09]: way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sexuality, sensuality, it can be a very
spiritual experience also for people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's so multidimensional.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Celina, it's interesting because
you mentioned it allows you to open.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it allows you to open and it
allows you to focus at the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of having your like you're
talking about, you know, like you're
[SPEAKER_09]: feeling things that you're focused on and
what I got to do tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got my grandma's health issues
going on the back of my mind over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It allows me to be completely focused,
fully present, in the zone, in the moment
[SPEAKER_09]: fully.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that for a lot of women,
that's where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where the arousal happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's so much, I mean,
in so many women's lives, there's so much
[SPEAKER_06]: else going on, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the kids and there's the family
and there's the chores they have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's so many other things that just
are flying through your minds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that it allows them to narrow
in and focus and forget about all those
[SPEAKER_06]: other distractions for a while.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to take this moment to
welcome our new panel member.
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I introduce Dr. Michelle Ross,
I just actually want to read Andrea's
[SPEAKER_16]: little bio just so the audience knows who
Andrea is.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Andrea Herman, she's previously been on
House Church with us.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's the owner of the Ridge Cannabis
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's a board member of the Hemp
Industries Association and also the
[SPEAKER_16]: Canadian Hemp Trade Alliance.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why she is such a wonderful hemp
expert.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, she's got another many
different hats she wears.
[SPEAKER_16]: I will post her full bio so you can get
more info.
[SPEAKER_16]: But now I want to introduce Dr. Michelle
Ross.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's a PhD, she's a neuroscientist and an
author.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's the founder and CEO of Impact
Network, which is a 501c3 nonprofit NIH
[SPEAKER_16]: registered research institute.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they focus on clinical research on
cannabis for women's health.
[SPEAKER_16]: So welcome, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're talking about cannabis for sex.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you have anything to add, please join
us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Or please tell us what's going on in your
day.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear us, Michelle?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure she can hear.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, we'll try to get things.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, does anyone else have,
yeah, I think she froze.
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anyone else have anything else they
would like to continue on with the
[SPEAKER_16]: conversation about cannabis and sex?
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the areas that I find really
intriguing is also, I'm not sure if it was
[SPEAKER_16]: brought up at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_16]: I missed the first little segment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also how cannabis can be used to help with
menopause symptoms and also painful
[SPEAKER_16]: menstrual issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of my dear friends suffers from
endometriosis and she gets very,
[SPEAKER_16]: very painful menstrual cycles to the point
that she says when she's having her worst
[SPEAKER_16]: days, even if she has medication across
the room, she can't get to it because she
[SPEAKER_16]: has to kind of crawl across the floor
because her cramping and pain is so bad.
[SPEAKER_16]: And once she started using cannabis,
this really helped get a lot of her
[SPEAKER_16]: symptoms under control.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the way she uses it is a number of
ways.
[SPEAKER_16]: She'll use a topical belly rub even to
help with some cramps.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's interesting, I've also
experimented a little bit this.
[SPEAKER_16]: I find if you put especially something
like peppermint or something menthol or
[SPEAKER_16]: cooling, that also has its own activity
against cramps.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that combo with the cannabis is really
effective.
[SPEAKER_16]: Another thing is, of course, we mentioned
suppository.
[SPEAKER_16]: And most women don't know that you can do
not only intravaginal, but interectal
[SPEAKER_16]: during your menstrual cycle.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can get, if you're having really,
really intense pain relief, you can just
[SPEAKER_16]: put it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it can really help target some of the
cramping, inflammation, overactive pain
[SPEAKER_16]: issues, and even sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_16]: So like breast tenderness and just even
muscle tenderness really increases during
[SPEAKER_16]: most women's menstrual cycle.
[SPEAKER_16]: So even using topicals for cannabis pain,
or sorry, using cannabis topicals to
[SPEAKER_16]: manage pain, even just like during the day
if you don't really want the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_16]: effects of consuming cannabis per se,
topicals can work really nicely also.
[SPEAKER_16]: Did anyone have anything else to add?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad you brought this up because so
many women suffer in silence.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that, you know, primarily,
I shouldn't typify, but I'm guessing that
[SPEAKER_09]: a large proportion of this audience is
men.
[SPEAKER_09]: So talking about women's health and menses
and making that a regular part of the
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation isn't really common practice
yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of women, especially when it
comes to their sexuality and when it comes
[SPEAKER_09]: to their menstrual cycle, aren't actively
speaking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that we deal with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got to say, for endometriosis,
for even bacterial vaginosis, for
[SPEAKER_09]: resolving Candida in the body,
leased infections, it can be so helpful in
[SPEAKER_09]: all those different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've found that it's actually a lot
faster acting than if you were to take,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, an extra strength Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've found that for the people that engage
with cannabis in that way for their
[SPEAKER_09]: menstrual cycle, especially when it comes
to like pain on the monthly, it's like an
[SPEAKER_09]: absolute go-to that can provide relief
without them feeling uncomfortable or
[SPEAKER_09]: unable to function.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of women, you know, they'll go to
work, they'll suffer, they won't say
[SPEAKER_09]: anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe their job performance is lower,
but this really gives them a discreet way
[SPEAKER_09]: of managing those symptoms.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you for adding.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops, you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for adding your perspective.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thanks for everyone for sharing
glimpses and hints of personal experience
[SPEAKER_16]: also.
[SPEAKER_16]: So just a little bit of a transition.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to give some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to give a shout out to 70's mama in
the chat.
[SPEAKER_16]: We always see you in there keeping the
peace, spreading good info and spreading
[SPEAKER_16]: good vibes.
[SPEAKER_16]: So shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to say that our thoughts are
with those affected by the wildfires
[SPEAKER_16]: happening in BC right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: Williams Lake was evacuated yesterday and
D420K, he's a part of this panel.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's from Williams Lake, so our thoughts
are with you and your family.
[SPEAKER_16]: And please be safe.
[SPEAKER_16]: Get out of the fires okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't worry about your stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just be safe.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully we can get Dr. Michelle Ross
back.
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be interesting to hear a little
bit about what she's working on.
[SPEAKER_16]: So did anyone else have something they
wanted to tell us about that they're
[SPEAKER_16]: working on?
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, Hilary, you mentioned some
initiatives you were excited about with
[SPEAKER_16]: your group.
[SPEAKER_16]: So did you want to talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it seems so boring to go there after
talking about sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, corporate social responsibility is
pretty exciting, but it's not nearly as
[SPEAKER_05]: fun as talking about sex.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you transition from sex to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where do we go after sex?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, actually, before we get into anything,
I wanted to just make a quick comment that
[SPEAKER_05]: in the chat, it's hard to keep up because
you all chat a million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've noticed that there's been quite a
few comments about like, where are the
[SPEAKER_05]: bong hits and where are the dabs?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a really kind of big part of
past church culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for myself, I just want to say that
I consume microdoses of cannabis and I get
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very affected.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that I do in public
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I don't really pass at parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really pass out in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really private thing for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to pass by myself, maybe with a
good friend or with a lovely lover because
[SPEAKER_05]: I have kind of reduced the doses that I
need to the point where a really small
[SPEAKER_05]: amount gets me super beautifully,
wonderfully high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wouldn't be able to keep up with
these brilliant brains on this forum or
[SPEAKER_05]: articulate if I did pass while I was here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, that's why I'm not showing big,
fat, beautiful, exciting bong reps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear that that's a complaint from
the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just not puffy enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to address that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm the only one that's been
toking.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm a micro toker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not a consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which is which is really odd for me
because I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like addicted to cannabis when it
comes to the knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't smoke every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use a topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis, but just don't use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is cannabis being consumed on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be just wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that Natasha is busy trying to
get Dr. Michelle back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Natasha asked me to tell a little bit
about some of the corporate social
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibility that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can come back to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we need to fill a little bit of
time while we're waiting for Dr. Michelle,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have another story that I want to tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I tell a story that I write with the
panel?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so we're talking about government
relations and education earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a very cool experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost a year ago now when Canada's task
force on legalization was busily touring
[SPEAKER_05]: the country and holding their stakeholder
meetings and asking all kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the mandates the government had
given our task force on the
[SPEAKER_05]: recommendations they're supposed to make
about what legalization is going to look
[SPEAKER_05]: like was basically that part of their job
and part of the mission of the government
[SPEAKER_05]: was to get cannabis out of the hands of
the criminals, which is like anybody who
[SPEAKER_05]: has grown and distributed been a part of
the underground industry that the
[SPEAKER_05]: government sort of perceived us all as the
criminals who they needed to take the
[SPEAKER_05]: business away from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Anne McClellan, the chair of the task
force and a couple of the other task force
[SPEAKER_05]: members came to the BC Compassion Club
Society.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it all happened kind of hush,
hush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a big deal for them to get
permission to come because it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the only illegal place that they
came to.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had been to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had been to like licensed producers,
production sites, but they had not been to
[SPEAKER_05]: a dispensary or another illegal cannabis
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we started them in our wellness
center where there's just people coming in
[SPEAKER_05]: to get visits with their practitioners.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not actually any cannabis on site
on that site.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we started the
conversation to, you know, also to get the
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling of this is a health care
organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't have a boardroom at the
Compassion Club because all the space is
[SPEAKER_05]: used for patient care or what the staff
admin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just circled them up in the
waiting room of the distribution center.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as we're chatting, they're watching
patients come in and show their card and
[SPEAKER_05]: get a hug and go into distribution and
talk about the different strains and
[SPEAKER_05]: coming out with their medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at first, a couple of them really had
their back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was very uncomfortable for them to
see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then over the course of an hour,
hour and a half, the experience just
[SPEAKER_05]: softened and just kind of like normalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that allowed us to start a
conversation about shifting their
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective from taking the business out
of the hands of the criminals to realizing
[SPEAKER_05]: that part of their job is actually moving
the like the people who have been in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry for a long time, who have built
it, moving them out of the dark and into
[SPEAKER_05]: the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Anne LeCuellen and some folks around
her called that moment for her,
[SPEAKER_05]: that experience for her at the Compassion
Club, a watershed moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it is just about
normalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is kind of like circling back to
what Rosie was talking about, is that we
[SPEAKER_05]: still have such a tremendous amount of
education to do, particularly with
[SPEAKER_05]: lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like for us, the
policymakers in BC who are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: determine what distribution looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as much as possible, I think we need
to get our local politicians or
[SPEAKER_05]: politicians at any level out to kind of a
healthy, professional cannabis businesses
[SPEAKER_05]: to actually see one operating and to be
around the cannabis and that that
[SPEAKER_05]: normalization is actually some of the most
effective education advocacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I fill up enough time that you got her
in, Natasha?
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, I don't know if she's going
to be able to join us again.
[SPEAKER_16]: She said her phone.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, she was having issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's at a conference and she said her
phone seems to be overheated.
[SPEAKER_16]: So she'll try, but she's like,
I'm sorry, I may have to sit this one out.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to introduce our new guest
joining us right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Dr. Adi Poh, welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, 80.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: 80.
[SPEAKER_16]: 80 is a neuroscientist studying cannabis
as a replacement for opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I had the pleasure of seeing 80 speak
to the recent ICRS conference in Montreal
[SPEAKER_16]: a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's shift the conversation a little
bit to cannabis as a replacement for drugs
[SPEAKER_16]: and especially let's talk about the opioid
crisis and how cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_16]: So please have the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll tell you a little bit about my
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: in neuroscience from Washington State
University, and I've done a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: postdocs at the University of Sydney,
Columbia University, and now I'm a junior
[SPEAKER_04]: faculty member at Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis,
[SPEAKER_04]: Missouri.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my work has always revolved around the
interaction between opioids and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've done a lot of work in opioid
tolerance and I've done a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_04]: the physiology of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is how these molecules act on the
brain to influence synaptic transmission
[SPEAKER_04]: and animal behavior.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am a basic researcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I use animal models and brain tissue to
study how the drugs actually exert their
[SPEAKER_04]: effects in the brain, both on their own
and in combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in my early work, which has also been
similar effects up and down the spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: have been observed in both animals and
humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my early work demonstrated that if you
give animals cannabinoids, then they have
[SPEAKER_04]: better opioid analgesia, that is pain
relief, and they also develop less opioid
[SPEAKER_04]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have a bi-directional relationship
where if the organism is sensitized to one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the molecules or exposed to one of the
molecules, their subsequent drug exposure
[SPEAKER_04]: is more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means for the clinic is that
we need less opioids in order to achieve
[SPEAKER_04]: the same pain-relieving effect if they're
used in combination with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my work has really revolved on
examining what the mechanisms of that
[SPEAKER_04]: behavior are and I've largely focused on
the brain areas that are in charge of pain
[SPEAKER_04]: relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also, the laboratory that I'm
currently in at Washington University,
[SPEAKER_04]: really studies the interaction between
opioid use, opioid misuse, and chronic
[SPEAKER_04]: pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in the pain center in the
Department of Anesthesiology, surrounded
[SPEAKER_04]: by other basic researchers and clinical
researchers, all who focus their efforts
[SPEAKER_04]: on understanding chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these topics, in terms of opioid pain
relief and how to use these very powerful
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs in a way that is responsible and not
harmful to people, is something that has
[SPEAKER_04]: been near and dear to our hearts for a
very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So going forward, my work is going to be
more and more focused on some things that
[SPEAKER_04]: we initially have been observing really at
an epidemiological level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's somewhat the case with cannabis
in general, is that the basic research is
[SPEAKER_04]: far behind the human experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people have been using cannabis
for so long, and especially in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States, we don't have any funding to study
the beneficial properties of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: the fundamental mechanistic research is
far behind what people are actually doing
[SPEAKER_04]: in their homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we have observed is that when
people are given access to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: they drop their opioid use by about 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is really my central hypothesis is
that if we can use cannabis in combination
[SPEAKER_04]: with opioids, you just fundamentally need
less opioids to achieve the desired
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask these chronic pain patients,
they don't like those drugs, they really
[SPEAKER_04]: don't like the side effects, they really
don't like the feeling that they get,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cognitive impairment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really excited about opioid
alternatives because they really are nasty
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs, even though the education of our
medical professionals and our medical
[SPEAKER_04]: schools and the common practices still
largely revolve around the use of opioids
[SPEAKER_04]: for many, many purposes in which they are
not appropriate for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually don't have a shred of
evidence that suggests that chronic opioid
[SPEAKER_04]: use is safe and effective for the relief
of chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather, the National Academies of Sciences
and Medicine just in January released an
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely comprehensive report that
demonstrated that cannabis is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: safe and effective for the treatment of
chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at the opioid crisis and
where it came from, and why it is so big
[SPEAKER_04]: and so ugly right now, we know that
opioids are pain relievers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole reason they're on the
market to begin with is to relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pain really is at the heart of this
crisis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to use the tools that we
know are safe and effective in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: treat pain safely and correctly and keep
this thing from getting worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it took us about two decades to get as
bad as it is now, where we have 91 people
[SPEAKER_04]: dying every single day from an opioid
overdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it took us two decades to get to be
that bad, and it's going to take at least
[SPEAKER_04]: another decade for it to get better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can accelerate that progress,
in my opinion, by really embracing the
[SPEAKER_04]: power of cannabis to really solve this
large public health issue and prevent
[SPEAKER_04]: people from overdosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that statistic that I gave you about
people lowering their opioid use by half
[SPEAKER_04]: when they have access to cannabis,
that specifically is in regard to chronic
[SPEAKER_04]: pain patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a similar thing is also observed if we
look at people who are illicit opioid
[SPEAKER_04]: users.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a group out of the University
of British Columbia who study illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: opioid users, and these are people that
have had frequent opioid abuse in the last
[SPEAKER_04]: six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you compare the people who don't
use cannabis at all to people who just
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes use cannabis, not even daily,
but even sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even infrequent use of cannabis
protects illicit opioid abusers by
[SPEAKER_04]: fourfold from showing up in the emergency
room with a non-fatal overdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is massive, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no idea what the mechanisms are
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow, these people are being protected
against opioid overdose, whether they're
[SPEAKER_04]: pain patients or illicit drug abusers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really the question that's at
the heart of my work, is what is it about
[SPEAKER_04]: this drug interaction that is able to keep
people alive?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the direction of my future
research, and this is really what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: focused on, is we know that there are
certain brain areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that there are certain cellular
and molecular mechanisms that somehow
[SPEAKER_04]: interact so that cannabis is, strangely
enough, protective against this huge
[SPEAKER_04]: monster of the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Marcia has a comment, and then I
want to ask you a question.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a basic researcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really a clinician.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I completely agree with you in terms
of what I'm seeing experientially is that
[SPEAKER_06]: the chronic pain patients that I'm seeing,
many of them are able to reduce their
[SPEAKER_06]: opioids, and not just their opioids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing huge reductions in
benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing reductions in antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to comment on a study
that was published in the US in 2016,
[SPEAKER_06]: where the researchers looked at,
looking at my notes here, they looked at
[SPEAKER_06]: prescriptions between 2010 and 2013.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they found was that in the 17
states in the US in which medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: is legal, prescriptions for painkillers
felt dramatically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And very, very significantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So per physician, the average doctor in
medical cannabis states, and again,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is per physician, prescribed 1,826
fewer doses of painkillers in a given
[SPEAKER_06]: year, 562 fewer doses of anti-anxiety
medications, 362 fewer doses of sleeping
[SPEAKER_06]: pills, 265 fewer doses of antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I want to point out that this
is per physician.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can multiply that by the number of
physicians that are prescribing 1,826
[SPEAKER_06]: fewer doses of painkillers per physician.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you can't draw a direct line
here, but certainly you can infer an
[SPEAKER_06]: association and that's, that's certainly
food for thought kind of makes you go hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, so that if if that's the
study, I'm thinking of that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradford and Bradford study, and they had
a follow on study, where they demonstrated
[SPEAKER_04]: that if medical cannabis had been legal in
all 50 states, rather than in just those
[SPEAKER_04]: states, it would have saved the US
Medicare program something on the order of
[SPEAKER_04]: like one and a half billion dollars in
specifically in prescription drug costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is this is a huge thing,
you know, and, and I think that a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: times, skeptics are, they really hang on
to the argument that, oh, everyone claims
[SPEAKER_04]: this to be a miracle drug, it's used for
everything, but there is actually some
[SPEAKER_04]: biological basis for the fact that it does
affect a lot of physiological and
[SPEAKER_04]: psychological processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just look at the distribution of
the CB one receptor, which is the receptor
[SPEAKER_04]: that delta nine binds to the CB one
receptor is literally everywhere in your
[SPEAKER_04]: brain, the only place that doesn't seem to
appear is in the place of the brain that
[SPEAKER_04]: is responsible for respiratory depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where opioids act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where people die from opioid
overdose is that respiratory depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everywhere else in the brain,
you've got CB one receptors, you've got CB
[SPEAKER_04]: two receptors in close proximity,
almost every one of your cells in your
[SPEAKER_04]: brain makes an and amide into a G,
which are the the endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is some validity to the point
that there there is a biological basis for
[SPEAKER_04]: for all of this to be happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this stuff really is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_06]: The issue that irks me as a physician is
really the fact that in Quebec at any
[SPEAKER_06]: rate, and I can only speak here,
you know, cannabis is really supposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: be reserved as a last resort after other
things have been tried.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I take issue with the concept
that I should have to try more dangerous
[SPEAKER_06]: medications like opioids, particularly,
or benzodiazepines first before moving on
[SPEAKER_06]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, patients are coming,
they don't want to die.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to be on opioids,
as you pointed out, they don't want to be
[SPEAKER_06]: on benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's, that's also true,
even for the seizure medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even, even in some US states where
there's no overarching medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: law, there are there are certain
exceptions for children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for instance, in the state of Missouri,
which is where my employer is based,
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of Missouri does allow a very
small population of individuals to get
[SPEAKER_04]: access to CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they have to demonstrate that
they have tried three other things that
[SPEAKER_04]: have not worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for these, for these families,
you know, they they've tried all the
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs, they don't want to have to
demonstrate that they've tried all these
[SPEAKER_04]: other things and the side effects are
super nasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really, I have a I have a
difficult time understanding the rationale
[SPEAKER_04]: for why you would, why you would put
someone through that process when they
[SPEAKER_04]: they should have the choice of what they
want to do first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I completely agree with that just
because we've been through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, it's nice to see you in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Colton was on OxyContin and
Colton was on morphine and Tylenol 3 and
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of crazy opioids, but also on
Humira and Remicade, which also created a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of side effects with his with his
Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want to be on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want to almost develop T cell
lymphoma when he had pre-cancerous cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were scared for that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he always says, why was cannabis my
last resort and not my first treatment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because now he's in remission.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been in remission for three years on
cannabis alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis not only put him in remission,
it's kept him in remission for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hasn't needed all these opioids or
all the chemotherapies and the TNFA
[SPEAKER_01]: blockers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I would love to know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to know what is the mechanism
that is making creating this remission in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colton and and why is it working like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I'd like to see
studied more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you that so recently at the
International Cannabinoid Research Society
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting in Montreal, there was extremely
exciting work coming out of Israel,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they were looking at some sort of
inflammatory bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the other big one?
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: In any event, yeah, ulcerative colitis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in ulcerative colitis patients,
they, you know, again, they put the the
[SPEAKER_04]: colonoscopy photos up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's like, in science,
sometimes we refer to a BFO effect,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a bloody effing obvious effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just just from a non professional
looking at the pictures of the
[SPEAKER_04]: colonoscopy, it is it is really quite
staggering how even a little bit of THC in
[SPEAKER_04]: combination with CBD is able to reverse
the effects of this extremely powerful
[SPEAKER_04]: disease in people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we're we're we are very,
very motivated to understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanisms by which this is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do know that there are CD1
receptors, you know, really studied
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the body that are mediating
these anti inflammatory effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the what's interesting is we theorize
that they don't even have to be on the
[SPEAKER_04]: surface of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can actually there there's some
evidence to suggest that even if they're
[SPEAKER_04]: buried deep within the cell bodies all
throughout the body, that they are still
[SPEAKER_04]: functional.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of other proteins of this kind,
the receptors of this kind, they have to
[SPEAKER_04]: be on the surface in order to exert their
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very fascinating that with the
cannabinoids, that doesn't seem to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: case.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be anywhere located anywhere in
the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some evidence to suggest that
they could still be doing their job and
[SPEAKER_04]: mediating anti inflammation.
[SPEAKER_16]: So ladies, I just want to welcome Dr.
Amanda Reimann into the room.
[SPEAKER_16]: Reimann or Reimann?
[SPEAKER_16]: How would you prefer?
[SPEAKER_16]: Reimann?
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, it's yeah, it's Reimann.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Amanda is a PhD researcher at UC
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's studying cannabis as a
substitute for alcohol and opioids.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she just had a study released looking
at these exact issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you want to tell us a little bit
about your study, Amanda?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I started looking at cannabis as a
substitute for just anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in about 2008, I was looking at a
sample of 350 patients who were telling me
[SPEAKER_08]: that for over half of them, cannabis was
being used as a mindful substitute for
[SPEAKER_08]: another substance that they deem to be
more hazardous to their health,
[SPEAKER_08]: whether that be a prescription drug,
alcohol, and as more states legalized
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis, and as opiate dependence
became more of an issue, people started to
[SPEAKER_08]: look more for substitutes for things
specifically like opiate based pain
[SPEAKER_08]: medication.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we saw in the dispensary world
was we saw people who are in their
[SPEAKER_08]: thirties, who had been working labor jobs
since right out of high school,
[SPEAKER_08]: who were starting to have chronic pain
issues or being faced with a decision at
[SPEAKER_08]: age 35, 36, do you want to start on a
regular regime of an opiate based pain
[SPEAKER_08]: medication like Vicodin or do you want to
try something else?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think for a lot of them,
cannabis was a viable alternative.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how we really understood that
patients were making this conscious
[SPEAKER_08]: decision that perhaps cannabis was a
better choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the study that I did back then was
replicated several times.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was replicated in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was replicated again in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the study that I recently
published, we replicated it again,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is to say that among the medical
cannabis patient population, there was a
[SPEAKER_08]: great deal of patients who are consciously
using cannabis as a substitute for some
[SPEAKER_08]: other substance because they fear negative
side effects, issues with dependence,
[SPEAKER_08]: potential overdose with these other
substances that they don't view with
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that they're finding that their
satisfaction with cannabis as a medication
[SPEAKER_08]: is right up there with their satisfaction
with their other medications in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I think what's really interesting
there's kind of two things from here are
[SPEAKER_08]: two places to be really interesting to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is looking at cannabis as a treatment
for opiate and other drug dependence.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the projects I'm involved in is
down in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a treatment center called High
Sobriety and they're using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_08]: medication assisted treatment to get
through withdrawal from opiates,
[SPEAKER_08]: alcohol and other drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So medication assisted treatment is not
revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_08]: We see people using benzodiazepines to
help wean folks off alcohol when they go
[SPEAKER_08]: into the hospital to go through
withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So using medications to help people
through the withdrawal period is fairly
[SPEAKER_08]: common.
[SPEAKER_08]: Using cannabis as a sanctioned standard
medication with a dosing protocol in
[SPEAKER_08]: inpatient treatment is fairly new and
revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what we're trying to show is that
cannabis is not looked at as interfering
[SPEAKER_08]: with the getting off of other substances,
but actually can be an aid to folks both
[SPEAKER_08]: getting through the withdrawal period,
which is a high vulnerability for relapse
[SPEAKER_08]: during withdrawal and also help folks
during the therapeutic period after
[SPEAKER_08]: withdrawal where they're trying to tap
into some of the trauma that may be
[SPEAKER_08]: underlying their dependence.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we know, cannabis can be a tool in
helping people deal with trauma.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think treatment for substance
dependence is one area where cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: substitution is very viable.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other one related to people with pain
and using opiates is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at cannabis as a one-to-one
substitution.
[SPEAKER_08]: As someone saying, what I'd really like to
see is a controlled clinical study looking
[SPEAKER_08]: at complementarity of cannabis and opiates
versus opiates alone so that we can look
[SPEAKER_08]: at cannabis being prescribed with opiates
almost like a prophylactic for the
[SPEAKER_08]: potential hazards that come with opiates,
accidental overdose, risks of dependence,
[SPEAKER_08]: and see if by giving people cannabis in
addition to opiates, we can reduce the
[SPEAKER_08]: dosage of opiates.
[SPEAKER_08]: So less opiates farther apart.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Donald Abrams has shown this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Mark Ware has shown this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have seen some evidence of this
complementarity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that that is another really
exciting place to look, because for a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of folks on opiates, there is a general
need for pain medication.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can really start where those
folks are, which is with this genuine need
[SPEAKER_08]: and severe pain, and try to bring cannabis
in as a way to offset the most severe side
[SPEAKER_08]: effects, which are death and dependence
from opiates, then that's another way
[SPEAKER_08]: where we may be able to help address some
of these issues while still managing pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's some of the stuff that I've
been working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could not agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the two most exciting frontiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a clinical trial that Tilray is
enrolling patients for right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically right along the lines with
your high sobriety project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be another opportunity
for us to replicate this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're absolutely right about
combination therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my work starting in 2004 has always
involved combination therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The efficacy and the safety of which in
terms of lowering abuse potential and
[SPEAKER_04]: lowering dependence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even way back in 2006, it was
demonstrated that in people, Delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and any kind of opioid have synergistic
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So synergy means a greater than additive
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes if you take two drugs and add
them together, two plus two equals four.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for many classes of drugs,
two plus two actually equals seven or
[SPEAKER_04]: eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I mean by synergy is you
have a greater than additive effect so
[SPEAKER_04]: that what you end up with is a reduced
dose that is necessary in order to achieve
[SPEAKER_04]: that desired analgesic effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that at least for some people,
cannabis alone isn't super efficacious.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, it's better than aspirin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to relieve pain better than
your average anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's nothing like an opioid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opioids are extremely powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're never going to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to continue to be used for
severe and especially acute pain,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's up to us to determine how we can
use that incredibly powerful tool
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainably and safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're right on target there
in that this is going to be the first line
[SPEAKER_04]: of treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Combination therapy at a low dose or even
ultra low dose of opioids, that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be the future for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a quick comment and a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I just want to say thank you for
the amazing research that you're doing and
[SPEAKER_05]: been distributing cannabis to patients and
to addicts for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so watching the evidence base start to
catch up to what we've been seeing on the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground is incredibly exciting because
that's when we start obviously having the
[SPEAKER_05]: information that is solid that we can pass
on to other clinicians and other
[SPEAKER_05]: healthcare professionals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I take my hat off to you two
and your work.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of months ago, my best friend's
18 year old daughter died of a fentanyl
[SPEAKER_05]: overdose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this crisis has just like touched
me and my family in a way that is really
[SPEAKER_05]: different than even working in it for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to ask you about cannabis
as a part of addiction treatment and you
[SPEAKER_05]: touched on it and you touched on it in
terms of managing the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_05]: withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if either of you have
seen any indications or if we're starting
[SPEAKER_05]: to gather any information about cannabis
actually affecting cravings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm thinking about that really
vulnerable time when folks are so likely
[SPEAKER_05]: to go into relapse, like say like with my
friend's daughter, Gemma, she was in an
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing treatment center for three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was just transitioning into a
supervised living situation and she had a
[SPEAKER_05]: relapse and that was it and she died.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder about, have we seen anything,
any evidence building up around or even,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like sort of pre-clinical
information around cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_05]: affecting the cravings and not just the
helping to manage the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_05]: withdrawal?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we do actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have evidence both pre-clinically and
clinically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a wonderful researcher out of
Mount Sinai and her name is Yasmin Herb
[SPEAKER_04]: and she's been studying sort of these
ideas of craving and relapse for many,
[SPEAKER_04]: many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So her pilot studies in humans mirror her
pre-clinical work and they demonstrate
[SPEAKER_04]: that for people who are illicit opioid
users, they give them CBD, just CBD alone,
[SPEAKER_04]: not even whole plant therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they give them CBD three days in a row
and they find that the CBD even on its own
[SPEAKER_04]: is effective to relieve cravings for up to
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mechanism behind this is that CBD
and other cannabinoids alleviate anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that negative emotional state,
it's like a, so mood has these cycles,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Up and down, up and down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with prolonged drug use, that up and
down starts to slowly drift even further
[SPEAKER_04]: down so that at the end of a prolonged
drug use period, you know, regular
[SPEAKER_04]: cyclical mood is way, way, way lower than
the baseline mood it used to be at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that cannabinoids can actually
elevate that baseline level of mood and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's important because that anxiety,
that negative emotional state is what
[SPEAKER_04]: leads to craving and to relapse and to
overdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have a lot of evidence that
suggests all that physiological withdrawal
[SPEAKER_04]: that people go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, cannabinoids are very good at
alleviating that physical withdrawal
[SPEAKER_04]: symptom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what's even more important is
after the detox period that we do
[SPEAKER_04]: something to maintain normal emotions and
your normal emotional mood system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are, there is some evidence being
spearheaded by Yasmin Her that suggests
[SPEAKER_04]: that cannabinoids can definitely do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of work to do there and I
certainly hope to be a part of that work
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's definitely like, you know,
what keeps me up at night is wondering how
[SPEAKER_04]: we can keep these people alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that management of the
long-term emotional state with cannabis is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to play a huge part in sustained
recovery from opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda, you wanted to add something?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just wanted to add that I think
another important part of this is the way
[SPEAKER_08]: we define recovery, the way we define
abstinence and its role in recovery,
[SPEAKER_08]: because a lot of the people that are in
recovery, they're absent from opiates and
[SPEAKER_08]: then they go back to it and they overdose
and they're having these craving issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make it okay to use cannabis in
those moments without telling the person,
[SPEAKER_08]: falling off the wagon or they're no longer
in recovery or they're not clean anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I hate that terminology of being
clean because I think we've set up this
[SPEAKER_08]: paradigm in the United States,
especially about what it means to be okay
[SPEAKER_08]: with drug use and what it means to not be
okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this arbitrary line between legal
and illegal, prescribed and street drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of people have died
because we're not making it okay for
[SPEAKER_08]: recovery to be self-defined.
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead, we're defining it by the
criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're defining it by a very rigid medical
system.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we need to challenge the paradigm
of recovery.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's also going to help open
up avenues for very important medications
[SPEAKER_08]: like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've had some deep discussions with
people in the recovery community who have
[SPEAKER_04]: treatment centers and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are so excited about CBD,
but they do not want to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes right into what Amanda's
saying with this sort of history of
[SPEAKER_04]: puritanical thinking that our country was
built upon, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I fundamentally agree that the
conversation about recovery needs to have
[SPEAKER_04]: a paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you look at the data,
abstinence does not work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at the data, replacement
therapy combined with social support is
[SPEAKER_04]: your absolute best chance of maintaining
long-term abstinence from drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, that medication-assisted
therapy or the opioid replacement therapy
[SPEAKER_04]: consists of things like buprenorphine,
suboxone, and methadone, which are
[SPEAKER_04]: unequivocally effective at helping people
keep from relapsing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even those people who are on those
opioid replacement therapies are still
[SPEAKER_04]: physically dependent, and they don't want
to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I hear this argument all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, people are on Lipitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are on blood pressure medicines.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are on insulin for the rest of
their lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we just put them on
buprenorphine for the rest of their lives?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't want to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want freedom from that opioid
dependence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take a minute to introduce a
longtime friend and colleague of mine,
[SPEAKER_05]: Erin.
[SPEAKER_05]: But funny, Erin, even though I have known
you well for many, many years,
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have no idea how to pronounce
your last name.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Prosk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Prosk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just as it looks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Erin is sort of a pioneer of medical
cannabis space in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: She opened one of the first medical
dispensaries in Montreal back in the days
[SPEAKER_05]: when it was terrifying to do so and has
been a dedicated patient advocate for a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, I'm not sure exactly what your
title is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could look up your bio.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you basically run Sante, the amazing
clinic that Marcia is also a part of.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your official title at Sante?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I use the title director.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mostly spend most of my time on
operations, relationships, contracts,
[SPEAKER_12]: development of programs, protocols within
the clinic.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the most experience on our team.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're adding more and more different
educators with different backgrounds and
[SPEAKER_12]: different team members.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I like to be in the middle of
everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd like to really be also moving more
and more into research, be able to spend
[SPEAKER_12]: more of my time working on new projects.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have access to a lot of patient data
and information, not just at Sante
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannabis, but at cancer clinics,
at producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a little bit crackly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you touching your mic by chance?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you have a set of earbuds,
stick them in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I do have them in.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have not a very good microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can actually hear you fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a bit crackly.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a question for Addie or Amanda.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was just wondering about this
topic that comes up a lot in clinical
[SPEAKER_12]: practice, which is about the risk of
opioid toxicity when we look at the
[SPEAKER_12]: theoretical data around the possibility
for cannabinoids, THC, and primarily CBD
[SPEAKER_12]: as well, the biggest culprit, to inhibit
some of the enzyme processes that can be
[SPEAKER_12]: really important in the opioid metabolism
process.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one criticism that we have all the
time when we're looking at combination
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid opioid therapy is that we
don't have enough information about the
[SPEAKER_12]: risks of opioid toxicity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is something that I find really
critical.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Amanda mentioned the only study
that's really looked at it, which is the
[SPEAKER_12]: Donald Abrams study that looked at chronic
pain patients who were using opioids as
[SPEAKER_12]: well as smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, that's just something that I
think we should talk about as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're looking at a lot of observational
data.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're observing patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in terms of getting over a clinical
obstacle, we really need to look at
[SPEAKER_12]: clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to look at the possibility of
changes to opioid levels, the amount of
[SPEAKER_12]: the difference in concentration that can
happen when we add cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, that was a question that I had.
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone has any thoughts about it,
I think it's an important counterpoint
[SPEAKER_12]: that comes up all the time when we talk
about the potential for cannabinoids as a
[SPEAKER_12]: complementary treatment with opioids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to go and specifically double
check the literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe there are a couple of
studies in Israel that have replicated the
[SPEAKER_04]: Abrams results.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was the clinical trial,
I believe, in 2014 that Psychomedical
[SPEAKER_04]: conducted for their vaporizer device.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is in a hospital setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are basically hooked up to an
IV, and they have periodic blood draws to
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these people were not pulled off of
their typical medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever they have in their system,
the cannabis was an adjunct therapy,
[SPEAKER_04]: an add-on therapy, not a replacement
therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that their evidence
supported Abrams work in saying that
[SPEAKER_04]: opioid metabolism and plasma levels of
opioids were not affected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I believe there was also a study,
the first author is Hark Tununian.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a super long name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually a colleague of mine at WashU
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they also had a clinical hospital
setting for chronic pain patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that they did some blood
work in their study as well, and they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't find any effect on opioids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the opioid-sparing effects,
that is that when people are using
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, they automatically self-titer
their doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not instructed by their doctors to
do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know exactly what the
mechanisms of this are, but they reduce
[SPEAKER_04]: their opioid use on their own,
maybe because their overall pain-relieving
[SPEAKER_04]: need, their analgesic need, is just lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can't say that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact that we have opioid-sparing
effects, even when people are just left
[SPEAKER_04]: out in the wild to do whatever they're
going to do with their medications,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is very promising.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it would be very helpful for
physicians to say, OK, we know that this
[SPEAKER_04]: drug interaction is not going to put you
in any further danger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And knowing what exactly those plasma
levels are over time would be an
[SPEAKER_04]: incredibly powerful tool in the hands of
those doctors who are otherwise
[SPEAKER_04]: conservative or skeptical.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm not familiar with the Israeli
studies, so it's good to know.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it might be something to just keep
watching for as more publications are
[SPEAKER_12]: being released.
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that I think also is maybe
interesting to talk about is entering this
[SPEAKER_12]: age of commercialization of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've talked about this a bit at Santa
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where when we start to have companies that
are pursuing IP around cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_12]: therapeutics, there's a potential for us
to actually lose out on some of the
[SPEAKER_12]: valuable information that comes out of
these studies, where companies are
[SPEAKER_12]: protecting the information that they're
finding.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're protecting their results.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we see that a little bit with GW
pharmaceuticals right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something that we talk about
how that is continuing to increase.
[SPEAKER_12]: So encouraging academics to study cannabis
and to do so in countries like Canada,
[SPEAKER_12]: where we have opportunity to do so within
the commercial framework.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that I don't know if
others are interested in talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it kind of links commercial to
research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can talk about, oh, we really want
a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want cannabis to have a drug
identification number and to be looked at
[SPEAKER_12]: like other medications.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think some of us who come from the
activism side actually have issues with
[SPEAKER_12]: how these drug identification numbers are
obtained and the amount of
[SPEAKER_12]: commercialization of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something that I'm really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a very hot topic, I would say,
in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if anyone else has any thoughts
about this new age that we're entering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm happy to put in my two cents
if no one else can say anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the US right now, unfortunately,
we have no other choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: This science is not going to move forward
with the help of the US government.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only way we're going to collect data
is with private money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with state money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my experience, particularly in the
Northwest, like Washington, Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California, Oregon, there is a fundamental
foundation of community, not competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone is doing this because they're
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone who's in the industry,
for the most part, was formerly an
[SPEAKER_04]: advocate and continues to be an advocate
and an activist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are huge efforts to keep this
kind of stuff in the public realm and to
[SPEAKER_04]: not make it patentable and to not make it
a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether it's getting the genome of
these cannabis plants out there in the
[SPEAKER_04]: public realm, the Open Cannabis Project
and Philos Bioscience are major,
[SPEAKER_04]: major players in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that because of the people
who, one, fundamentally understand
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis science and two, are in a
position to be able to exercise it,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're fortunate that a lot of these things
are going to be moving forward in the
[SPEAKER_04]: public realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, America being the land of
opportunity, there are going to be some
[SPEAKER_04]: people who are developing proprietary
combinations of molecules or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also have the tools to just buy one
of those pens and run it through a mass
[SPEAKER_04]: spec and see what's in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think that I'm at least
hopeful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm naive in this, but I am hopeful
that cannabis medicine will continue to be
[SPEAKER_04]: in the public realm for a very,
very long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to make sure everyone had
been introduced.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was away for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Erin, you've already been contributing
to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Erin Prosk is the founder of Sante
Cannabis in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you for creating such a
wonderful organization.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also have Jenna Valeriani,
who's a PhD candidate at the University of
[SPEAKER_16]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's studying cannabis policy in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Jenna, can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I can hear you guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_16]: So can you tell us a little bit about your
work and what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: So my research that I've been doing
actually started just doing ethnographic
[SPEAKER_14]: fieldwork in a dispensary, you know,
kind of ages before the MMPR kind of came
[SPEAKER_14]: out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, then they announced
this new program.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I actually study the intersection
between social movements and an emerging
[SPEAKER_14]: industry, which was the MMPR at that time,
around 2014, 2015.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm really interested in what happens
when kind of these new kind of players
[SPEAKER_14]: come to this landscape, they start seeing
cannabis as a, you know, a tradable
[SPEAKER_14]: commodity where it never really was.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you already have this really
developed social movement and landscape
[SPEAKER_14]: around access, which certainly was the
case in Canada with dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_14]: medical cannabis and kind of this idea
that patients were the one really driving
[SPEAKER_14]: change.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of my work really looks at the
tensions kind of between, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: in entrepreneurship and all kinds of
avenues of the new industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also do a lot of work with Canadian
students for sensible drug policy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been doing that work now for
about, you know, five or six years,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I've kind of transitioned into this
advisory role.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of doing a lot of work right
now around legalization in Canada and most
[SPEAKER_14]: importantly, kind of making sure that
young people are having the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_14]: participate in, you know, these
conversations around legalization,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, considering that one of these
really big pillars is around protecting
[SPEAKER_14]: young people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I helped organize a
roundtable with the task force that was
[SPEAKER_14]: just, you know, 25 young people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And right now we've actually partnered
with Canopy and Parent Action on Drugs to
[SPEAKER_14]: develop kind of this educational toolkit
to address this kind of gap that we really
[SPEAKER_14]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it really came out in our roundtable
and in kind of the bigger roundtable
[SPEAKER_14]: around, you know, getting, you know,
scientific, evidence-based, non-judgmental
[SPEAKER_14]: education to young people and also kind of
remembering that parents and educators
[SPEAKER_14]: really need to be part of that
conversation as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of starting this project
right now where we're just kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: reviewing a lot of common cannabis use
claims.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to prepare kind of a toolkit
that can then be used to develop a variety
[SPEAKER_14]: of different kind of tools for youth and
for parents and, you know, just to kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: address this need that we're seeing right
now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of the work that I'm doing
right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hillary brought up that you guys are
working on some projects together.
[SPEAKER_16]: So did, Hillary, you want to jump in here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Jenna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, like I wear a lot of hats in
the medical cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been talking a lot about my history
with my passion club over the past 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years, but I also work with Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that I get to do for
Canopy Growth is kind of choose projects
[SPEAKER_05]: that we fund in terms of the corporate
social responsibility side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really important to me that we
fund not only kind of addressing key
[SPEAKER_05]: issues that the country is facing,
but also that we fund the pioneers and the
[SPEAKER_05]: people that have been kind of working in
the trenches on things for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So previous to this awesome youth project
that we're doing with Jenna, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: tackle doing something around driving
because there's so much contradictory
[SPEAKER_05]: research about driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will try to get in the chat in a
minute for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's these phenomenal papers that were
done by the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually one of the women who was
supposed to join us today, Rielle Kapler,
[SPEAKER_05]: who is an amazing researcher and advocate
who I've worked with for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: She spearheaded doing a literature review
and a knowledge translation paper to
[SPEAKER_05]: really bring us to an evidence based place
of having, you know, like very reasonable,
[SPEAKER_05]: balanced, accurate information about
education around cannabis impairment and
[SPEAKER_05]: driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm thrilled that we're doing the
same thing with Jenna, that the country's
[SPEAKER_05]: all in a flutter about cannabis and youth.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, you know, Jenna can speak to this
better than I can, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: contradictory information about cannabis
and youth, about brain impairment and
[SPEAKER_05]: leading to addiction and all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wanted to support another
similar project where somebody who has
[SPEAKER_05]: been working on cannabis and youth issues
for a long time, like Jenna can be funded
[SPEAKER_05]: to do a proper lit review and come up with
a knowledge translation strategy to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: basis for a particular set of tools that
parents action on drugs is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: create, but also as a tool set that will
be available to the whole country because
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a researcher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I sort of like, you know,
stick my toe in the water and drop PubMed
[SPEAKER_05]: and try to like figure out, you know,
what the state of evidence is on some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these issues where there's a lot of
contradictory information, I need somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: who that is their realm, like Jenna to
kind of dig in and come up with those
[SPEAKER_05]: tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: So super stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really fun going from working
with a nonprofit organization that gives
[SPEAKER_05]: away all of its resources for all on
health, supporting health care for people
[SPEAKER_05]: generally living in poverty to working for
a publicly traded organization where I get
[SPEAKER_05]: to give them money.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to build on that, too,
I mean, these kinds of, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: having access to these kind of this kind
of grant funding is so important for
[SPEAKER_14]: organizations like CSSP.
[SPEAKER_14]: And particularly, you know, we keep we're
we keep kind of trying to engage the
[SPEAKER_14]: federal government kind of on this budget
commitment of nine point six million
[SPEAKER_14]: dollars that they're putting towards
public education.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's over five years.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we really see, you know, that if
they're really committed to, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: this legalization, you know, that they're
going to be implementing so soon that,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I'm not sure where that nine
point six million dollars over five years
[SPEAKER_14]: is really a strong enough commitment.
[SPEAKER_14]: We know places like Colorado, maybe
someone from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_14]: can kind of chime in here.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm quite sure that they spend up to
forty five million dollars in just their
[SPEAKER_14]: first year in public education.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we start thinking about young
people and then we start thinking about
[SPEAKER_14]: different vulnerable populations that may
need different approaches to this kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: education, it seems like, you know,
it's going to be really challenging
[SPEAKER_14]: without, you know, having kind of these
different organizations come in and kind
[SPEAKER_14]: of put in the work where it's really
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of speak on SSCP and here in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We they do a lot of work with the youth
and just like you guys do in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a program called Good to
Know in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is that a lot of it
isn't for they're not studying the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy of of what's happening in kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're looking for that
negativity that, you know, they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see these kids not succeeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why, because my my kid is
doing great and he's not lost any brain
[SPEAKER_01]: cells or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that really we need to start
focusing on trying to find the efficacy
[SPEAKER_01]: and not being so negative with this with
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, in Colorado, you've you've
you can notice that there's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference and and people that they use
cannabis for a medical reason and use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also see a drop in kids that are
using cannabis recreationally across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board now that we've legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is this is something I'd be very,
very interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I think that the research really
needs to happen because I think that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing that people want to think
that, you know, kids are just want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: high and and kids are just wanting to use
cannabis, just like using alcohol just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's, you know, it's it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is this is definitely something
that that needs to be figured out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was really important.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you really brought up a really
interesting point is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: education just doesn't want to acknowledge
that there are young people who are
[SPEAKER_14]: currently using.
[SPEAKER_14]: So education needs to be created that
also, you know, can address young people
[SPEAKER_14]: who are already using cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Prevention is, of course, like a really,
you know, is a big part of that
[SPEAKER_14]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, we wanted to lay the early
onset of use in that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, we need to be giving tools
to young people who are already using are
[SPEAKER_14]: going to continue to use regardless of
what the law says.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always find it really interesting that
when we think about prohibition and we
[SPEAKER_14]: think about legalization, the mandates are
almost like quite similar in the way it's
[SPEAKER_14]: being set up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: This idea of, you know, protecting young
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same kind of discourse that we're
really drawing on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's, you know, for us,
a big piece of this education that we're
[SPEAKER_14]: putting together is talking about,
you know, reducing harms as well and that
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of these risks can actually be
mitigated by, you know, changing your
[SPEAKER_14]: consumption patterns or your frequency of
use.
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are kinds of things that we want
to include as well as also having pieces
[SPEAKER_14]: that can also speak to young people who
are already using and help them,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, minimize the risks and kind of
have a little more agency over that as
[SPEAKER_14]: well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So so, yes, I think a lot of the things
that you spoke to and we actually do want
[SPEAKER_14]: to reach out to SSDP over the Just Say No
campaign as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were reviewing that and we think
that there's some really good tools there
[SPEAKER_14]: and some really awesome potential for
collaboration as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hook you up with the people from
SSDP here in the United States if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't already have that hookup.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they're just phenomenal people and
just love working with them and going to
[SPEAKER_01]: their conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just amazing and I love what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I'd like to see more efficacy,
more benefits to using cannabis than all
[SPEAKER_01]: this negative stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't seem to be all about the kids
drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, everybody's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they just have a nonchalant
attitude about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to cannabis,
everybody's like, oh, you're a drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a druggy, you're a stoner,
you're going to, you know, have the egg
[SPEAKER_01]: and the frying pan issue and all that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather I have I have four
children and three of them are in their
[SPEAKER_01]: teenage years right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather see them use cannabis than
use alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I don't see where the ice,
the difference in the risk is is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can get in the car and kill
somebody or kill their liver or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's so much stuff with
alcohol that is so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet, you know, that's that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cannabis use is like, oh,
gosh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, again, at the recent ICRS,
there was some really interesting data
[SPEAKER_04]: that was being conducted in Washington
state with their cannabis tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it demonstrated contradictory
contradicting all the earlier stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: showed that adolescent exposure leads to
all these impairments and executive
[SPEAKER_04]: function.
[SPEAKER_04]: Memory, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It showed that that there was a
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're talking about a difference of
getting six questions out of 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than seven questions out of 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they compared people who had,
you know, adult onset use of cannabis to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, around age 16 or lower use of
cannabis, there a lot of the differences
[SPEAKER_04]: were not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, there were there was even
one, you know, lab test that they did on
[SPEAKER_04]: these individuals where the cannabis users
performed better, regardless of whether
[SPEAKER_04]: they had started as adolescents or as
adults.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we have a lot of work to do in
this field, because I think that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely the case that the human brain
does not finish developing until you're
[SPEAKER_04]: around 21, 22, maybe 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do something to interfere with
the normal developmental processes that
[SPEAKER_04]: are going on in this period, there there
is a chance that you could be exposing
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself to subsequent mood disorder or
depressive disorder or some sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: impairment in cognitive function.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a lot of work to do to figure
out exactly what those impairments would
[SPEAKER_04]: be if if they are indeed there at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that I jump or no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say that, as it was
pointed out before, a lot of studies have
[SPEAKER_06]: been set up to look at negatives and
certainly in the US, a lot of and sort of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what came out of these studies
were some positive effects and positive
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits in terms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But many studies were set up initially to
look at negative effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always find it interesting that when
one small study shows a negative effect,
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody points to it and says,
Oh, look, you know, they point to the
[SPEAKER_06]: harms of cannabis that are that are that
came up a single study.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, when a study shows a
positive benefit, everyone says,
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, that's one study,
we need more evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a bit of a hypocrisy there in
the interpretation of evidence as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, the reason for that negative
bias and the US is, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: because of our, you know, federal schedule
one situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I have money from the
federal government to study this stuff is
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm going through the National
Institute on drug abuse to study this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: No other part of the federal government
will give any researcher any money to look
[SPEAKER_04]: at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so yes, neither is interested in
studying drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's the whole point of their
existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there there is absolutely an inherent
negative bias bias.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, neither is interested in finding a
negative result.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't part of, you know, resolving drug
abuse be part of that schedule?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that just hopeful thinking?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I will say that cannabis use
disorder does exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there are people out there whose
lives are negatively impacted by their
[SPEAKER_04]: chronic use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding what separates those people
from the people who don't develop cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: use disorder is still very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: How important is it compared to the other
problems that we're dealing with?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's pretty low on the totem pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that NIDA is starting to
reflect that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very recently, Nora Volkov,
who's the director of the National
[SPEAKER_04]: Institute on drug abuse, she has she has,
you know, come around and said,
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we do definitely know that cannabis
has some medical utility when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: the prevention of opioid overdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that is as far as NIDA is willing to
go as of this point as of today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're willing to acknowledge that if
we look at the epidemiology, yes,
[SPEAKER_04]: in those states where there's cannabis,
there's less opioid overdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I think we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from informal conversations that I've
heard of that happened, in D.C.,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're very interested to see what's
going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, NIDA's hands are also tied
by the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if Nora herself, you know,
who knows what she does in the privacy of
[SPEAKER_04]: her home and who knows what opinions she
has in the privacy of her office,
[SPEAKER_04]: but she's a federal employee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if she comes out and says anything as
the director of NIDA, she's definitely a
[SPEAKER_04]: risk of losing her job, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I think that we are there is some
promising progress there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But until schedule one goes away,
nothing else is going to get better.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if that's a good argument for
really looking to Canada, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of the things that we're talking
about also like these issues with the
[SPEAKER_12]: literature.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, sometimes it's just not the research
hasn't been broad enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's been so focused on looking for
drug abuse that they pull out,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, the idea that a young person is
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And use that as kind of a causal reason
why, you know, various things have gone
[SPEAKER_12]: wrong later in years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then, you know, those of us here today,
we we know that there are so many more
[SPEAKER_12]: socioeconomic impacts and so many other
factors that contribute to success in
[SPEAKER_12]: life.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that, you know, that's
something where, you know, we really need
[SPEAKER_12]: to show use industry to show some
leadership.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the government, even in
Canada, is not really interested in
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at this kind of broad look at the
risks of drug abuse when it comes to
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they're not really focused on
cannabis use disorder and the true
[SPEAKER_12]: definition of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just so focused on the idea that
cannabis use will increase when when it's
[SPEAKER_12]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_12]: Recently, I was very recently at the
Quebec Legalization Expert Forum,
[SPEAKER_12]: and it was unbelievable in this room of,
you know, 200 experts from across the
[SPEAKER_12]: province, the amount of fear that was
coming up to the microphone and being
[SPEAKER_12]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea that, you know, cannabis use
rates are already very high in Canada and
[SPEAKER_12]: very high in Quebec and very high among
young people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And legalizing it could very likely,
according to the room, increase use.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I think that, you know,
Jenna definitely said it best.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the ten million dollars over five
years is not going to come close to the
[SPEAKER_12]: level of education that's needed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, how will that funding even
be dispersed?
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be the education should start
now and we should be focused on quelling
[SPEAKER_12]: the fear.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of not just people who are, you know,
outside of cannabis, but even to parents.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk about, you know, empowering young
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about empowering the rest of people
to talk to their kids about cannabis use?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think that, like all of these
things, I really am excited about cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: leadership on this subject, because I
think that there's a lot of potential for
[SPEAKER_12]: industry to show leadership in this area.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, you know, more broadly into
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I even, you know, I'd really like,
you know, to look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: how profits from the cannabis industry
could be well spent and, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: and whether, you know, those of us in the
field could influence the government on
[SPEAKER_12]: how to spend these profits.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think California is a great example of,
you know, the social justice movement and
[SPEAKER_12]: how that's really defined regulations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know maybe Amanda knows a bit more
about how those profits will be spent.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is, I think, a big conversation,
you know, education, research funding,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, how can we influence how these
funds will be allocated?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can definitely speak to California
specifically, but then also just kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: in general about how I think the industry
can take the lead on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in California, you know, the public was
very clear they did not want the revenue
[SPEAKER_08]: to go into one big general fund,
because quite frankly, they didn't trust
[SPEAKER_08]: the state of California to put that money
to good use.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was very specific with the majority
of the money being allocated to youth
[SPEAKER_08]: treatment and prevention services,
and not just abstinence-based services,
[SPEAKER_08]: but really stuff that more addresses what
puts youth at risk.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is really where the
industry can play a role, because,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we all see the please drink
responsibly and those kinds of things from
[SPEAKER_08]: the alcohol industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we kind of laugh about it and like,
yeah, they're just doing that because they
[SPEAKER_08]: have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't really care.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we can do as a cannabis
industry is get at what really puts kids
[SPEAKER_08]: at risk for youth drug use, which is
poverty.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lack of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lack of community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's their parents being in prison and
their family members being in prison
[SPEAKER_08]: because of drug-related crimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the things that end up putting
kids at risk.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the drug use is just a symptom of
those issues because they're trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: self-medicate for the pain and trauma
because of all those other things going
[SPEAKER_08]: on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, you know, the cannabis
industry could put a ton of money into
[SPEAKER_08]: logos and bumper stickers and education
tools and things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should definitely bolster those
efforts.
[SPEAKER_08]: But an even better and more lasting way to
have an impact is for us to be putting
[SPEAKER_08]: money into after-school programs and
reform and economic development programs
[SPEAKER_08]: and urban farming programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're starting to see some of these
things happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot going on in the Bay Area
around some different social causes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then up here in Mendocino,
I'm working to create a nonprofit called
[SPEAKER_08]: the Mendocino Impact Fund.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to funnel money from the
cannabis businesses in this area to local
[SPEAKER_08]: nonprofits and organizations that are
helping to support the economic and social
[SPEAKER_08]: infrastructure of the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where the money needs to go,
to the social and economic infrastructure
[SPEAKER_08]: of the community and not just to make
ourselves feel and look okay by telling
[SPEAKER_08]: kids not to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should absolutely give parents
educational tools, a lot of focus on what
[SPEAKER_08]: that education and information looks like.
[SPEAKER_08]: But make no mistake, there's a lot of
revenue coming through this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we really focus it right,
if we focus it on the pressure points that
[SPEAKER_08]: regular society has turned its back on,
believe me, it's so much easier for us to
[SPEAKER_08]: say that the downfall of urban areas is
because of individual drug use than it is
[SPEAKER_08]: for us to say that it's because of
economic and social disparity that we have
[SPEAKER_08]: to handle.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we've been creating.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as the cannabis industry, which is
traditionally made up of marginalized
[SPEAKER_08]: individuals, it's our responsibility to be
the first ones in line to go after those
[SPEAKER_08]: pressure points.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we do that, we will end up seeing
growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will end up seeing economic benefits
above and beyond the jobs and everything
[SPEAKER_08]: that comes along with the industry itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since we're in half church,
I'll say amen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could I ask about how the government or
how the industry was able to influence the
[SPEAKER_12]: government?
[SPEAKER_12]: Were there precursor steps to be able to
get the attention put in the right areas?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one thing that I wondered,
listening to the drug policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a lot of it for us here in
California was who we were working with to
[SPEAKER_08]: get legalization done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we partnered very early with the
California Society on Addiction Medicine
[SPEAKER_08]: because they were part of the Blue Ribbon
Commission that was set up to study how
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana or cannabis could be best
legalized in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were pretty much allies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think we're getting to the point
where a lot of addiction societies and
[SPEAKER_08]: professionals, medical societies and
professionals, social and criminal justice
[SPEAKER_08]: organizations, public health
organizations, environmental organizations
[SPEAKER_08]: are starting to see that if the choice is
condition market, right, no control over
[SPEAKER_08]: everything, chaos, what we have in a lot
of states and regulated market,
[SPEAKER_08]: that for all the things they care about,
the regulated market is better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was harder to get them to buy into
that when we only had one or two states
[SPEAKER_08]: that had legalized because of the stigma
around cannabis was so great at the idea
[SPEAKER_08]: of a public health organization actually
supporting legalization was kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: unheard of.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now they have the data and they can
say, look, teen use hasn't increased in
[SPEAKER_08]: any of these states.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't seen dependence increase in any
of these states.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen opiate dependence go down in
these states.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the markers of what a good public
health policy is are borne out through
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we can show that it's easier to
get these allied organizations on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that one one lesson we can
take from the opioid epidemic in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular is, you know, it is truly this
combination of economic poverty as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: social poverty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at the root of addiction,
a lot of people describe it as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a void that people are trying to fill
with something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if their life has no purpose,
if they have no meaning, if they have
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing that feels like they are they have
a real virtuous part in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: then they they have a void and they fill
that void with something that makes them
[SPEAKER_04]: feel numb, in this case, the opioids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so filling that void with something
that is virtuous, that gives people a
[SPEAKER_04]: reason to live, that engages them with
their community.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those things are synergistic in
creating healthy, happy communities and
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just fell in love with you all a
little bit this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some seriously, seriously amazing women,
both like your expert, all of you,
[SPEAKER_05]: like not just your expertise, but your
passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we're inundated with so
many overwhelming and depressing problems
[SPEAKER_05]: in this world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you are a panel of amazing solution
makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really touched.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I want to thank everyone again,
for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, this was pretty amazing since
I contacted you all within a week of doing
[SPEAKER_16]: this.
[SPEAKER_16]: And by some magicness, we were all able to
come together.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, we had almost 20 of us over
all popping in throughout the episode,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope this can spearhead some more
future connections.
[SPEAKER_16]: And who knows, maybe we can do more of
these style of panels.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, it doesn't just have to be the
whole women takeover thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It can be men and women, but just
furthering the conversation and being
[SPEAKER_16]: boundary spanners, bringing in new people
and helping to teach them the old
[SPEAKER_16]: knowledge and also be open to learning new
knowledge and I mean, PhDs, MDs,
[SPEAKER_16]: patients, moms, like we can all learn from
each other.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's really important for us
to come together.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also want to say thank you to Marcus
Richardson, bubble man, who's this is his
[SPEAKER_16]: platform.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, I mean, he let us use his space
today, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you to the audience and the
viewers.
[SPEAKER_16]: This was fun to do.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also want to give a shout out to
Chimera.
[SPEAKER_16]: This was his idea.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's a member on the panel, likes to get
his chemistry on very, very knowledgeable,
[SPEAKER_16]: knows a lot about the plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_16]: But he, we hung out at ICRS at the meeting
and just by meeting all these amazing
[SPEAKER_16]: women and seeing all these amazing,
just new people to the industry and the
[SPEAKER_16]: realm of cannabis that most of us don't
hear about or know about.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope we can keep this up and keep
connecting with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shout out to you, Natasha,
because you did a ton of work to organize
[SPEAKER_05]: all of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This didn't just fall into place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really pulled this off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was nice having your backup as a co
pilot on this crazy ride.
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of you women.
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously, thank you so much for coming
and spending time with us.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can end at one or we can keep
chatting, whatever you guys want.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can take some questions from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you guys feeling?
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you getting tired?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to go join my family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for the opportunity to
be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was lovely chatting with you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I need to get going too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to pop up for a little bit,
but I can certainly pop back in if if the
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanted to say thanks so much for
having me here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And while you know, just listening to
Amanda speak was so inspiring.
[SPEAKER_14]: And while I have you on the line,
Amanda, I just want to say that I've been
[SPEAKER_14]: reading your work for so long.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've you know, I read your dissertation
and I'm just so inspired by everything
[SPEAKER_14]: that you just said.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, so I guess we could end here
while we're in a high note.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all excited and still a little eager
to keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll save that for a future panel
where we can get together on another
[SPEAKER_16]: Sunday and talk cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a quick thank you that I really
wanted to save for this entire episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been waiting for the right
moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I wanted to to say it right
to you, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_09]: From my heart to yours, we would not have
created our organization if I hadn't have
[SPEAKER_09]: found yours.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at a space where I was so frustrated
with what I was seeing in the dispensary
[SPEAKER_09]: world, seeing the people being mistreated,
the plant being misused and just so much
[SPEAKER_09]: pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to like cry because it's.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at a point where I was so frustrated
after I left that job.
[SPEAKER_09]: That I said, what is a fucking compassion
club anyways?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I Googled you and I found BCCCS.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I watched the intro video.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I bawled my eyes out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said to myself, this is what it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my girlfriend, Laura and I took a trip
and we toured your beautiful facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it truly is the inspiration for the
groundwork for what we've been able to
[SPEAKER_09]: create so far.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you
because I wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be involved if I hadn't have
found that space of hope and truth and
[SPEAKER_09]: compassion in what I feel these
individuals truly deserve.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are honestly sick and accessing
services through your organization that
[SPEAKER_09]: are helping them not only keep symptoms at
bay, but at their best, not have to depend
[SPEAKER_09]: on pharmaceutical drugs anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their life back.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their health back in the most
beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've provided a framework for them
to be able to access.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just I wanted to thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually thought I was going to
sneak off at the end of past church
[SPEAKER_05]: talking with a bunch of women without
getting teary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and you know, like that reflection
goes right back to you because you saw
[SPEAKER_05]: something that you wanted to emulate and
running an organization that provides
[SPEAKER_05]: integrated patient care and is like really
providing for people who are critically
[SPEAKER_05]: and chronically ill.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not where there's a lot of money to
be made in this industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at all, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nobody here, but there's love and
there's support.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really feel like there really are
kind of handful of gender gems across the
[SPEAKER_05]: country that are, you know, and that
handful is growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally turning into a small heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I also acknowledge you as
somebody who and, you know, Aaron on this
[SPEAKER_05]: panel as well, who has really put
themselves out to provide super high
[SPEAKER_05]: quality patient care.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to thank you, West Coast
ladies, because I think you've done so
[SPEAKER_06]: much to drive this whole movement forward,
drive this whole conversation forward,
[SPEAKER_06]: real pioneers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, it's been such a pleasure to
be a part of this today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel really honored.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to leave you beauties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to see you all really soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dog is giving me the stink eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to take him out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to all of you folks that are watching,
it was a real honor to get to be here
[SPEAKER_05]: today and we'll see you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mark, I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll chat soon.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So bye, everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you again for joining us.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to give props out again to
Marcus for lending us his channel for the
[SPEAKER_16]: day and again to Chimera for coming up
with this great idea and getting us all
[SPEAKER_16]: excited.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to close the session by may the
full melt bless your bowl sooner rather
[SPEAKER_16]: than later.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll see you next week on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_16]: With your regular panel.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a great afternoon.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
