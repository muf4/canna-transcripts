[SPEAKER_14]: All right, here we go, here we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: And boom, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Hash Church, good morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hash Church 2020, this is Hash Church 3.0,
episode two.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm gonna send out the links to our
panelists, see if they can't make the
[SPEAKER_15]: journey over this way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just get these sent.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one, there's two.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's three.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, look at that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice and quick, mama, nice and quick.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even sure how you did that so
quick, but I will add the new Hash Church
[SPEAKER_15]: to the old link.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure everyone else has done it
already, but let's see when we get some
[SPEAKER_15]: friends in visiting.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, what's up, Yawn Bigtime Inc,
El Babi, Kevin Jinn, Jimenez, Family
[SPEAKER_15]: Outcast, David P. Chapman, and Hemp Guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for showing up, Hemp Guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you hear me?
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear you beautifully about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Wade Lafters in the house,
and I can see him.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to see you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Skunkman Sam and Wade are the first two
guys into the room today.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had less of a plan today.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, last week I had a little bit of
a discussion with people, and we kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: had an idea what we were gonna talk about,
and there was a good 10 plus people that
[SPEAKER_15]: had responded that they were gonna be
coming in, and today was really much last,
[SPEAKER_15]: it was kind of last minute.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really sort of hit people up with an
email just yesterday, so I'm not sure how
[SPEAKER_15]: many people were gonna get in,
but either way, I'm down with talking for
[SPEAKER_15]: as long as it goes, and great to see you
both here in Hash Church with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you're looking good, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got your camera all operational.
[SPEAKER_19]: Finally figured it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost by accident, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's your back doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Getting better?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm not ever gonna roll big diesel
engines over again, or hump big rounds of
[SPEAKER_19]: oak, but yeah, I'm able to do lightweight
farming, and last time I saw my grandkids,
[SPEAKER_19]: I was able to pick them up, so.
[SPEAKER_19]: So blessings.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's interesting as a man growing older
and just slowly losing the ability to do
[SPEAKER_15]: certain things, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a big challenge, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_19]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, because we don't feel older.
[SPEAKER_19]: No.
[SPEAKER_19]: In our brains.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like a kid.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like a kid.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I look in the mirror, and it's like,
who the hell is that guy, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I'm out on the farm, and there's a
big tree has fallen, and I wanna drag it
[SPEAKER_19]: out of the way so I can keep going on what
I'm doing, and I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I gotta go ask somebody else to help me.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a real challenge for somebody who's
used to being able to do whatever the hell
[SPEAKER_19]: he wants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I discovered it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm not quite there yet,
but at 47, a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_15]: almost three years ago, I destroyed myself
on my dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really damaged the inside part of my
leg in my lower back, and oh, there's
[SPEAKER_15]: Alice and Maria, the girls in green.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on, girls in green?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, what's up?
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Hashtarks.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so good to have you both.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you guys know Wade or
Skunkman Sam, or if they know you,
[SPEAKER_15]: but welcome.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna introduce you guys to both of
these guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these girls are great.
[SPEAKER_15]: I met them fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got to hang out in Jamaica for a while,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we did about a week.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are some serious hash aficionado
women in the room right now, which I have
[SPEAKER_15]: a real fondness for and an appreciation
for.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're incredible activists.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're from Brazil, but they've been
traveling around.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I kind of want you guys, if you can,
to maybe give a little history of
[SPEAKER_15]: yourselves, how you guys got into cannabis
and where it sort of led you in these last
[SPEAKER_15]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I really dig what you guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I would just like to say it
is an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I mean, at least I can say for
myself, when I fell in love with all this
[SPEAKER_11]: hash making world, like I used to watch
that hash church like a long, long time
[SPEAKER_11]: ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is an honor to be here today
together with Maria and you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm super grateful and happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys for having us, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't known hash church for as long as
Alice, but since I've known it,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen that it's like amazing that
putting so many people together in a chat
[SPEAKER_11]: room can make different conversations come
like unexpectedly and everyone giving in
[SPEAKER_11]: their opinions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's a very, very, very
effective and new way of doing
[SPEAKER_11]: communication in internet.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's great to have you both.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, one of the things I love
that you guys are doing is that you're
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of, you know, Brazil is this
incredible country.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just has these incredible people.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has this incredible terroir.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never been able to visit,
but I'm going to absolutely get down there
[SPEAKER_15]: now that I've got some great Brazilian
friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I like about it, you know,
Brazil is almost cut off in a sense that
[SPEAKER_15]: the people speak Portuguese and a lot of
people don't speak English.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the information of cannabis really is
not as accessible to the majority of the
[SPEAKER_15]: people as it maybe should be.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is why I started with Yao with
the Gonja Talks University to try and,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, do a little thing where he would
translate everything into Portuguese and
[SPEAKER_15]: then I could help educate some of the
Brazilian people.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you guys have taken it a way step
further in the sense that, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: you guys have really good English as a
second language.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're out in the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen you guys in like California
working on gross and humble.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I love that you guys are out there
doing that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then bringing that back consistently,
nine out of 10 times when I see you guys
[SPEAKER_15]: post, it's in Portuguese and I can't
understand it, but it makes me feel happy
[SPEAKER_15]: that all of those other people can
understand it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So great job on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a bunch of information in English
for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've really reached one of the most
important things of our work, which is
[SPEAKER_11]: like having all this information that we
have the privilege to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_11]: outside, with our travels, with like me
living also in California, and then
[SPEAKER_11]: translating it in a simple language for
Brazilians, because we do have a huge
[SPEAKER_11]: country and we do have a bunch of stoners
in Brazil, especially cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: This would be like an amazing and huge
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there a lot of, is there a lot of
pastiche in Brazil?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there is, is it imported or is it
made in Brazil?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, actually, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Brazil has more or less 210 million
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say, I have no idea how much
percent of the population actually smokes,
[SPEAKER_11]: but of the population that does smoke 80%,
I would guess, like, but it's a good
[SPEAKER_11]: guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smokes something that's probably you guys,
if you're all in Canada, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_11]: you have seen, but it's like Greek wheat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greek wheat from Paraguay.
[SPEAKER_11]: That one from the like 80s or 70s,
I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_11]: So no, unfortunately, the answer is like,
there is hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for those of us who like it and have
the privilege to buy it, have a
[SPEAKER_11]: connection, honestly, guys, do you think
that we just went to Humboldt like
[SPEAKER_11]: straight up like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we knew where the hash was coming
from.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we reached out for where it was
coming from.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's go.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how did you guys get started on your
your sort of hash path?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you guys are hardcore.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when I when I bumped into you guys in
Jamaica, you guys had all the kind resins,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, like light colored and amber
colored and like you guys are
[SPEAKER_15]: connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like not everyone I bump into pulls out
like the straight fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like, Oh, do you want to hit?
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to hit some of this?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I have this and I have this and they
got the puffco everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm usually that guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just just so you know, my because this is
the cookies and cream that I'm eating same
[SPEAKER_11]: one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, the cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So winery is watching when also like a
strange thing has been growing for a long
[SPEAKER_11]: while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dino's cut so much love to this dude,
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, Maria, if you want to start
talking a bit about the story,
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's up the puffco now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to get my bong up while I listen
to Maria talk about the story.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have like I think the girls in green
started because we are good friends for
[SPEAKER_11]: like a while now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were like cannabis aficionados,
actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we started growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: She started growing with her boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to live in Barcelona and I started
going a lot of string hunters and like met
[SPEAKER_11]: the guys there and like they started to
teach me so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were like exchanging pictures every
day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we said, OK, let's just go on
Instagram and find out more about
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And both of us from the start looked
smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I smoked tobacco a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for me, it was like a getaway from
tobacco, from like smoking Marlboros.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marcus doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it never smokes or slips.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like and then starting to know
more.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Alice went to California and
started trimming.
[SPEAKER_11]: So she started teaching girls in green a
lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you started the process that
Marcus said of translating so much for the
[SPEAKER_11]: Brazilian culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were already doing some experiments
like the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, when we were in Jamaica,
I showed Marcus like first time we watched
[SPEAKER_11]: like bubble hash here was like 2015 or
2014 with his bags.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, look at the shitty hash
Marcus here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this very, very green water like
our very look at the bad mistake we made.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were already making it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, on that point, Alice,
honestly, someone hit me up today on
[SPEAKER_15]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_15]: They left me this huge long message about
how they're about to do their first batch.
[SPEAKER_15]: They are terrified to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want to grow this beautiful crop
and make a mistake with your thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: But please, I implore everyone that's
listening right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please make a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please fall flat on your face.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't be afraid to make mistakes because
that's where all of our revelations
[SPEAKER_15]: literally come from.
[SPEAKER_15]: And some of the biggest innovations have
come from some pretty amazing size
[SPEAKER_15]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't be afraid to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know in the Instagram world of posting
only the perfect angles and the perfect
[SPEAKER_15]: hash and the perfect colors.
[SPEAKER_15]: We all create this sort of illusion that
that's the way we see the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the real reality behind all of that,
that there's a bunch of ugliness and
[SPEAKER_15]: there's a bunch of mistakes and there's a
bunch of disappointment and there's a
[SPEAKER_15]: bunch of adversity that actually will lead
us to our successes in life.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you learn more from mistakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's coming from a guy that just
came from Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we all know that he's forgotten more
than most of us will ever know about
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a profound statement for him to
say.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thanks for backing me up on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And welcome to Debbie Goldsbury into the
room here.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's coming in live from California,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're at the dab bar.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell us about your new dab bar.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice to see your smiling faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing, Debbie?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were just listening to the girls in
green that were showing up.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to have yet another woman.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just never get enough women in Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm changing that for Hash Church 3.0
big time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm forcing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everything's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just going to set up over here,
hoping to see some people this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, just we opened up our dab
bar about two weeks ago and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready for people.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm really envious.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me tell you, we we had a good thing
going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I opened my vapor bar, geez, in 2003,
quite quite a bit ahead of its time,
[SPEAKER_15]: really.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mark Emery opened one up not too long
later.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's still kind of going.
[SPEAKER_15]: But a lot of the lounges in our city that
opened up, unfortunately, have sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: disappeared and closed down.
[SPEAKER_15]: And even a couple of puff Wednesdays ago
with John Berfalo, we found ourselves in
[SPEAKER_15]: the rain under a bridge having a session.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there was nowhere for us to go.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a bit of a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's like, look, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a federal law.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, give us a space.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spencer, are you trying to get a license
for onsite consumption?
[SPEAKER_06]: So hard, very hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to sign on with the.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a second.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're cutting out on me a little bit
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep breaking up, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, Colin.
[SPEAKER_15]: I muted you.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you go to talk, I just muted you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought your mic was affecting Debbie's,
but I think it was just her connection.
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully she can she can make it back.
[SPEAKER_15]: Debbie always has a bit of a hard time on
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: But once it works out, she's she is an OG
in the in the community down in
[SPEAKER_15]: California, for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: She was one of I guess she started with a
chain of originally at the Berkeley
[SPEAKER_15]: Patients Group.
[SPEAKER_15]: But even before that, I knew I knew
Debbie.
[SPEAKER_15]: I met Debbie through Hillary Black,
who started the B.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I met her and one of her partners at
the time here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, two doors, two doors over from
the house I'm in right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Twenty two, twenty three years ago is when
I met Debbie.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what a what a kind of trippy small,
small little community it is for those
[SPEAKER_15]: that like I mean, here's the thing about
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's it's there's a multitude of pathways.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's the sort of you know, there's the
business aspect, which is like,
[SPEAKER_15]: oh, yes, that's not really the community.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the community is is more like
people like like Wade and like Forrest and
[SPEAKER_15]: like Wendy Turner and like, you know,
Stunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just I just see the community as
this wonderful, incredible thing that's
[SPEAKER_15]: growing daily.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time I go to events, I meet new and
interesting people.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's a trippy story.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to have a neighbor that we didn't
really connect.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were friendly to one another,
but I always felt like I could have been
[SPEAKER_15]: his friend.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the end, I ended up finding him at
Lyft two days ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I walked by and he was selling
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, hey, Ted, what are you doing
here?
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, oh, well, I I sell
greenhouses to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, well, for how long have you
been doing that?
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, well, I sold my first
greenhouse probably in 2008 for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just like, this guy was my
neighbor for like two years and we never
[SPEAKER_15]: hung out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he I'm like making all the hash and
he's selling all the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got their weight, a little tincture
down the hatch.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wade's dosing live on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: I found that a little bit of CBD and THC a
couple times a day helps the man feel
[SPEAKER_19]: good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I felt like you were going to do some sort
of Mary Poppins play on a little bit of
[SPEAKER_15]: sugar helps the medicine go down.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there it was, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like that was a psychic moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now the Dragonfly Earth medicine has
come into the Hash Church room.
[SPEAKER_15]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, good morning, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh is here too, but I'm solo for right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super happy to join you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was Lyft?
[SPEAKER_15]: Lyft was great.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like I made Lyft wonderful
because I smoked hash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went, I walked around with my pipe and
my torch like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I just blazed inside and at large
groups, like only one group told me to
[SPEAKER_15]: leave their booth because I was puffing.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have to say how many very large
companies were willing to allow me to
[SPEAKER_15]: vaporize a dab of cannabinoids was good.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it helped me realize, look,
obviously I was pushing that envelope a
[SPEAKER_15]: little bit, not trying to get anyone in
trouble, but trying to push the envelope
[SPEAKER_15]: that maybe if we had cannabis use at these
events rather than free alcohol,
[SPEAKER_15]: we might create a different vibe for the
business that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's so important
because you're talking about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: community and that is cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sort of like, hey, here we are
and this is us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sort of helps in a way infiltrate
the community into the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that you're pushing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, I always knew that
cannabis does help change the way you
[SPEAKER_15]: think.
[SPEAKER_15]: Regardless if you're inhaling it into your
lungs, you could be consuming it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could be wearing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can be driving down the highway and
see it growing on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll have an effect on your
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the way the plant works.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you are inhaling it, it's really
like, it's the one they're the most afraid
[SPEAKER_15]: of.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're kind of like, okay, yeah,
okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's maybe it's recreational, but like,
you know, for God's sakes, don't inhale it
[SPEAKER_15]: into your lungs, but would you like some
tequila?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just the mentality that they're
coming from.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't exactly know who they are when
I say they, but I just, I think it's
[SPEAKER_15]: important for us to push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to be rude.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would never blow, like create a smoky
environment, but I'm vaporizing at low
[SPEAKER_15]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sharing this wonderful resin with
everyone at the event.
[SPEAKER_15]: And all of us are at that event monetizing
this incredible, you know, beautiful
[SPEAKER_15]: female aspect of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there should be a respect that is there
as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I try to bring that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I went down to the NCIA to
do a presentation down there, there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of, you know, suits, a lot of big sort
of corporate industry people and then,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, after parties and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was the only one there who was
smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a trip to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like it's important,
you know, like every time that we sit down
[SPEAKER_05]: to do any type of a meeting or any kind of
any type of signatures or we're,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, going to do any mergers or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always pull up a chair for the cannabis
plant, you know, I say, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is, this is such a big part of this
industry and we can't forget about,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we always pull up a chair for the plant
as well and say, this is what we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: here for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's important.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I really got to give it up to,
obviously, I could say this about
[SPEAKER_15]: everything for everything, but the OG to
do it was, was, was Gunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like he just, did not give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_15]: He would puff everywhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was just like, and I was always like
that too.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like I saw him and I was like,
I'm going to copy him and do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was one of the things I was like,
I'm probably going to get along with this
[SPEAKER_15]: guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: He does not give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's definitely going to be using cannabis
wherever he wants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he'll gladly get into a loud
discussion about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was, I, were we at a restaurant one
time, you, me and Rob, and I think it was,
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was Simone's place.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we were there and you were like,
I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was like, of course you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: So of course Sam smokes as we all do,
cause Rob and I aren't going to watch Sam
[SPEAKER_15]: smoke and not smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then someone in the restaurant,
like that, like some Dutch people or
[SPEAKER_15]: whatever were like upset that we were
smoking in the restaurant and the owner of
[SPEAKER_15]: the restaurant told them that they could
leave.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't that happen?
[SPEAKER_13]: It sort of happened to us at the Roger
Waters concert.
[SPEAKER_13]: We may have gotten in trouble at the Roger
Waters concert too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to happen everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else used to do that back in the day?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was with Jack Herrera at a Chinese
restaurant, just in LA somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: The restaurant staff didn't know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just smoked marijuana, had our food
and that was that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very true too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jack was very, very much like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and almost equally as abrasive as Sam
could be about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, and, and I say that with love.
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely don't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He couldn't be as abrasive as me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try hard.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jack could be pretty abrasive in a good
way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to have these old memories.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to have, you know, everyone in the
room right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: We kind of had a nice quiet start to Hash
Church today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, we had no plans of
discussion.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just were like, let's gather and talk.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, you know, a little bit more about
Lyft, I guess.
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't really see any, I did,
I did see one of our alumni, one of our
[SPEAKER_15]: congregation, Jonathan Zaid, if you
remember this young fellow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jonathan was maybe 15 years old when he
came on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't, maybe he was older, but he was
the kid who was starting, really
[SPEAKER_15]: intelligent kid, very much not from the
cannabis world, very just like growing up
[SPEAKER_15]: in a Joe Strati environment and just
intelligent and sort of got sick and
[SPEAKER_15]: started using cannabis and then became
like the face for, you know, getting the
[SPEAKER_15]: insurance companies to pay for it the same
way they do pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I did see him speak a little bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: That there was very few people in those
seats.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've had that, I think I had that with
someone else.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were telling me they went up to tell
their story and their story is super
[SPEAKER_15]: profound.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like a patient story.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was just very few people there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, you know, the guy from Marlboro
or the tobacco giants came and spoke and
[SPEAKER_15]: it was standing room only.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so that was kind of like,
I guess that is a little bit of what's
[SPEAKER_15]: going on in the cannabis industry right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what is Lyft?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it like a expo or weed event?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's our MMJ conference sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It started out pretty small, but yeah,
it's at the convention center.
[SPEAKER_15]: It happens in Toronto and it happens in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's a time where an
enormous amount of people from the
[SPEAKER_15]: community come down.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you guys remember the documentary,
I don't know if I sent it out by email.
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of meant to.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm out of space called The Need to Grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: I sent it to Josh and Kelly for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: I may have sent it to you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's password blocked.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good documentary.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got some sort of inspirational stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it would be a good thing to
have a talk about it eventually.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I met one of the guys who was
involved in that film.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was kind of valued time that I
spent with him.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I saw, you know, good people from,
you know, Ian Davidson from SEGRA.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to spend a bunch of time with him.
[SPEAKER_15]: I bumped into Aaron from DNA Genetics and
he's like, oh, I just, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: we had a power failure right before I left
California and I didn't bring a jacket and
[SPEAKER_15]: it was freezing out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I gave him my jacket.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, well, dude, whatever,
man, you know, I got you.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I gave him my jacket off my back.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he, and then I saw him in the city a
day later.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was driving and I was like, that looks
like my jacket.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, he's got the hood up,
his hands in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pouring rain and cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, he didn't see me,
but I laughed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, okay, he's getting good use
out of the jacket.
[SPEAKER_15]: And while I was talking to Aaron from DNA,
Sabo from Hanula Labs walks in the door
[SPEAKER_15]: and I love Sabo.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just such a great guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm always wanting him to come on and
share.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the way he does these dialogues,
these sort of parenting and cannabis use
[SPEAKER_15]: talks that he's really sort of pioneered
from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see Irie's talk on psychedelics by
any chance?
[SPEAKER_15]: I unfortunately missed it, but I got the
better Cliff Note version from Irie
[SPEAKER_15]: herself.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I chain fed her dabs at a booth that
had like a big joint rolling machine.
[SPEAKER_15]: She was like, Oh, let's go to my friend's
booth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what I loved about Lyft that
people that had paid big money for these
[SPEAKER_15]: booths, people that had like interest in
all sorts of, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: look, we don't want to be, I'm not
interested personally with all licensing
[SPEAKER_15]: and what my companies are going through to
be like breaking a bunch of laws,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I do need to push the envelope of
civil disobedience to a point where we
[SPEAKER_15]: understand like, listen, we need lounges.
[SPEAKER_15]: Give us somewhere to do this then if we
can't do it wherever we are.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need that more often.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to break those boundaries down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the rules that are made to be
broken.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we're not doing our job if we're
following those rules.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they have no business being in town
with their corporate entities without a
[SPEAKER_13]: smoke and weed all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one good thing about all these rules
is like when I was in high school,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got way higher when you smoked a joint
in the boys bathroom than if you did
[SPEAKER_03]: anyplace else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that really is the truth right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to try and say before I
cut out last time, my bad internet
[SPEAKER_06]: connection is we have a licensed
dispensary so hard to get a faith loan
[SPEAKER_06]: permit, but there's probably 50 of them in
Oakland, just unlicensed, not being,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have a low enforcement priority for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's so weird how people can open and
elicit one very easy, but if you're,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, willing to come above board and
be taxed and regulated, it's nearly
[SPEAKER_06]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So God speed to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we need to get these things
everyone, but it was enormously difficult
[SPEAKER_06]: for us to get our license.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the only thing I go back to,
cause I hear that and it pains me.
[SPEAKER_15]: It pains me to hear things like Colton and
his family had to move away from their
[SPEAKER_15]: family to be like in prison in Colorado,
basically, because the only place they
[SPEAKER_15]: could use that, that cannabis sort of
safely.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, it's just such a bummer.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then I think it's not quite as big of
a bummer as, you know, say Rick DeLisi's
[SPEAKER_15]: father, getting put in prison for the last
37 years, or for when they would kick our
[SPEAKER_15]: doors down and like shoot the dog and then
break up the family and then have the wife
[SPEAKER_15]: have to visit the husband in prison for 10
years on the other side of the country.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, cause they weren't doing all
that sort of shit for a long time too.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think what they're doing now is
complete and total bullshit as well,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's such a more filter diluted
version of the shit that we've been
[SPEAKER_15]: dealing with for the last 30 years that we
trek on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like you're doing it, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just like, no, no, I'm,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Down here in California, everyone's always
complaining about our legislation because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's far from perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it created this ridiculous tax scheme.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be obvious that the
underground economy is left out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: above ground market because it's too
pricey to get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a lot of guys in suits,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really does suck.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, we're working to
improve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we still do have a flourishing
underground economy like it or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the regulation has made it safer for
that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're seeing less people arrested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Families aren't being destroyed anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're not, we're not so worried
that they're going to shoot our dogs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's been so many
improvements and I don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: in some ways I think like this,
like we've got to keep getting those suits
[SPEAKER_06]: stoned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, isn't it the more high we get them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the more they think like us,
doesn't marijuana change the way that
[SPEAKER_06]: their thought process works?
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, let's start making sure like
you're saying carry our, our, our vape rig
[SPEAKER_06]: around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We even had a funder recently come to
Magnolia trying to raise money to expand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the guy got so curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted to dab, dab the heck out of him.
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed his life in one dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you could potentially even put a
little drop on the top of the puff coat
[SPEAKER_13]: that they take a hit from if you really
want to change some minds.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I follow, I follow the Timothy Leary
school of thought, not for many things,
[SPEAKER_15]: but for his two commandments of thou shalt
not keep people from taking psychedelics
[SPEAKER_15]: and matters about a batters about dose.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thou shalt not give psychedelics
without one's knowledge.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a virtual strategy.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, and, and totally agreed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it does change the way people think.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why, if you have the
opportunity to give someone who's never
[SPEAKER_15]: been given a dab that could, you know,
could affect things down the road in a
[SPEAKER_15]: really good way, be responsible and don't
use that as an opportunity of revenge to
[SPEAKER_15]: destroy the person, but use that as an
opportunity to truly give someone a
[SPEAKER_15]: special experience and show them how
incredible of an experience you can have
[SPEAKER_15]: from this plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm, I am the master of the micro dab
because I want people to feel that the
[SPEAKER_15]: taste I want them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly don't want to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like give that person two hours of anxiety
and discomfort, and then have them never
[SPEAKER_15]: want to use cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like give yourself a check if you're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And have I done it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was joking about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to change people and they
don't want to smoke, so be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Help them make money off of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll change your mind also.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what's changed most of their
minds right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So many of them are like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what would you rather have them
doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Locking people up and putting them in
prison?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is where, this is where you and I see
eye to eye, Sam, because I say this to
[SPEAKER_15]: people and they look at me like I'm an
alien.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're like, they're like, we can't let
judges and cops be apart.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of this industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, why would you rather them be
bashing people's heads in and giving them
[SPEAKER_15]: 10 year sentences for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course we want cops and judges to be
involved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want them to control it,
but we, they should be allowed to play and
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone should be allowed to play.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm fighting for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I would have to disagree with
you guys on this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think, I think that it's
really important that the craft that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're taking on and something that you're
putting, you know, your whole life work
[SPEAKER_05]: toward is something that you should
actually know about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: as a heart surgeon, somebody doesn't go in
and be like, Oh, I'm studying all this
[SPEAKER_05]: heart surgery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling myself a heart surgeon,
but Hey, I've never done heart surgery
[SPEAKER_05]: before, but I'm out there in the world
doing heart surgery, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: or like all, you know, me in the
naturopathic world, you know, seeing all
[SPEAKER_05]: these, you know, massive male doctors that
are OBGYNs and they're trying to help
[SPEAKER_05]: women have babies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're saying, it's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, have your baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when they've never experienced
it before, it's really hard for me to feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like you have to make that bridge in order
to, to, to embody something that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing and feel really good about it and
know that you're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very, very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a very, very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Marcus and I are really saying is
it's better for them to be selling,
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, whatever than busting and putting
people out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and we need those people to change
the way they think.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want those people to change.
[SPEAKER_15]: And why would we try to keep them from
that change?
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's these counterpoints to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause on that point, that point makes all
the sense in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course we want them to be involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I would love to offer my time and
energy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want it like, do we hold people?
[SPEAKER_15]: To the mistakes or to the choices that
they've made in their past, or do we allow
[SPEAKER_15]: for growth in this world?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we here to grow or are we here to,
you're either at the top at this level
[SPEAKER_15]: right now, or you can't be with us over
here because we've walked this walk.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, no, I walked the walk,
but I did it like a naga baba for
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone, not just for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant is an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It, it, when you ingest it, when you grow
it, it adapts the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: When, when you're around it, it adapts
your mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: When a community takes it on, it adapts a
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that it's really important to
see all different facets of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one thing I would, I would argue
the same, you know, way that a small
[SPEAKER_05]: grower, you know, the industry,
and I would say, Hey, it's important for
[SPEAKER_05]: you to know all parts of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the plant is adapting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's okay to step in the port side
of it as well, because then you're seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: all sides of cannabis as it is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as if I would say that to the
corporate entities, Hey, smoke a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit so you can see the whole picture of
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not just a born again Christian
thing where you can just be like,
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I haven't changed forever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hire me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's making great points.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very, it's very much the red thread.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it, it, it, it draws a line where,
where everyone can kind of pay attention
[SPEAKER_16]: and come together on.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it allows us, you know, it's like the
circle, you know, you invite everyone and
[SPEAKER_16]: you try to invite everyone into the circle
and you, you, you share in that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's, you know, there's,
it's delicate to, you know, I see both
[SPEAKER_16]: sides of it and I appreciate both sides of
it, but it's really delicate.
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to understand where we come from
and where we're going.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, we want to include as many
people as we can, but we also want to
[SPEAKER_16]: have, you know, everyone's voice at the
table too.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want to be, you know,
just moving too quickly.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is delicate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that point, I, I'm glad we're able
to have a conversation where, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: like we can disagree, but still like,
I like, I stick by my point.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Kelly said what she said.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, I, I'd stand by her point
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I'm standing on both sides of the
fence, like, wow, it's really about having
[SPEAKER_15]: the discussion because it changes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there, there's really subtle nuances
in the changes that if you're not
[SPEAKER_15]: continually having the dialogue,
and we become afraid to have the
[SPEAKER_15]: conversation, it's like, Oh, I,
I'm not going to commit to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to get bashed on social
media.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, then, then all of a sudden it
just goes away and it becomes a lot more
[SPEAKER_15]: shallow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's one of the values of
Hashters that we're all willing to have
[SPEAKER_15]: these conversations, whatever they are,
they take us down these rabbit holes and
[SPEAKER_15]: doesn't necessarily mean we have to be
that person that we were three years ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well you said this three years ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in those three years I grew and I
changed and I learned.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I'm saying this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that allowed?
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've heard from a lot of people is
it's not right that they make a profit
[SPEAKER_03]: when they were anti-cannabis for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so what if they were anti-cannabis
for so long?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want them to stay anti-cannabis or
would you like them to be, if the only
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that'll move them is to be,
you know, trying to make money off of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say more power to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if they make some profit from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you never have the whole time I've
known you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Potent Ponick Steve is in the room.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's in Zimbabwe in Africa right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's saying, you know, they should be
lining up behind the cannabis veterans.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's disrespectful to those who hid and
fought for decades.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see his point as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've just, it's a hard thing to just pick
one side because I see, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_15]: yeah, I don't want them doing that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd way rather than be like, yeah,
like maybe I'll do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I say like, oh, if, if someone
was busting people for like the last 20
[SPEAKER_15]: years and now they want to be in the,
in the cannabis industry, well,
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe they're not a cannabis grower,
but maybe they're really good at security
[SPEAKER_15]: and they'll keep your cannabis grow from
getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like it's not like I'm saying
they should get in and start becoming our
[SPEAKER_15]: growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the thing that really is bothering
me right now, besides the loss of the
[SPEAKER_06]: culture and the fact that so many people
are going out of business because they
[SPEAKER_06]: can't get the highly costly permits,
is that like, I feel like cannabis is
[SPEAKER_06]: magical.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis changes people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adaptogen, what a great word.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it transformational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you use cannabis, you're one way,
you use it, you're another way afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even our facility, we want it to be
transformational like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You feel one way, you come into the
facility, the way you're treated and
[SPEAKER_06]: respected and the things that happen
change the way you think and you exit
[SPEAKER_06]: another way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been trying the entire industry and
our effort to legalize cannabis is based
[SPEAKER_06]: on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're legalizing cannabis because we want
to transform the way people think about
[SPEAKER_06]: being nice to each other, about sharing,
about being tolerant and kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis drives those values somehow
by what it does to our minds and how we
[SPEAKER_06]: discuss things like this when we're
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's missing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wear your damn suit, but you got to
realize this isn't corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a magical plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we as a culture have to insist
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're transformational.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to stay in food and want
to just make money, fuck, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_06]: we're on the same page exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try and transform you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's doubtful that it's going to go the
other way around.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yon Big Time, Inc.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at it as truth, they need
transformation an awful lot, just like
[SPEAKER_03]: alcoholics need transformation an awful
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And medical people have problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need transformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the anti-pop people, they need
transformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we could flip the script here really
quick because Yon Big Time, Inc.,
[SPEAKER_15]: my boy in Brooklyn, just made a really
good point.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, you know, in New York,
it's not about the police and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a race thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now we get into what about all the
brown people in prison?
[SPEAKER_15]: For this still and all the white people
who are profiting off of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And who wants to have that discussion?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's where everyone is going.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: In California this year, there was
actually a lot of families that were held
[SPEAKER_13]: at gunpoint this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were police officers that cut
down people's greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were a lot of families afraid
this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it is a little hard, you know,
to be a radical family member.
[SPEAKER_13]: And join forces with anyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're in full agreement that anyone
deserves transformation.
[SPEAKER_13]: What were you going to say, Debbie?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've probably had a hundred different
thoughts since I tried to say that first
thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was in regards to the race,
you know, aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course it's who's getting the
permits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big money moved in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that tended to be these white
guys in suits.
[SPEAKER_06]: They took all the permits off the table
right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they were lobbying most of these
big governments and small governments on
[SPEAKER_06]: creating the regulations to be sure that
only they can afford the permits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty messed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously there's a huge movement now,
both national, statewide and city by city
[SPEAKER_06]: to create and build equity into the
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not easy to pin down
legislatively equity because you can't be
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you just can't give out permits
based on race.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you create equity in a democratic
system and put teeth into it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really damn hard, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of it starts with people having
to work very hard, especially people that
[SPEAKER_06]: have the privileges and the permits
already.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the cost of the permits and
where are you going to get your money and
[SPEAKER_05]: how is it that you're going to start up?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've been in the black market or
an illegal grow for a really long time,
[SPEAKER_05]: how is it that you're going to form a
corporation like here in Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have a corporation that's
formed by, you know, the government of
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to have that, you know,
you have to show some kind of funds in
[SPEAKER_05]: order to get an account up here in Canada
that's listed under hemp or under
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be able to show that you have
funds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't show where those funds
came from and you've been in the black
[SPEAKER_05]: market, and you weren't able to put it
into something, you know, that made sense
[SPEAKER_05]: for them to be able to accept your
application, then you're shit out of
[SPEAKER_05]: water.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's S.O.L.
[SPEAKER_05]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that, you know, a lot of the
cannabis culture is dealing with that as
[SPEAKER_05]: well as a lot of, you know, people of
color all over the world, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or women.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even women, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of women are in this industry and
they didn't show where their cash was
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, you know, just making cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they can't step into the industry
because they have zero credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's a super huge issue,
I believe, in the in the brown cultures as
[SPEAKER_05]: well is because, you know, it's not credit
in the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not an equal playing field.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's look at an opportunity to join
together and become stronger.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if people of color are having a hard
time, it doesn't mean you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It almost makes it even more amazing when
you do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would love to see more, you know,
brown people, more women.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I don't like to just call it
brown people.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just feels weird, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: But any person that feels like they're not
having an opportunity, I would love to see
[SPEAKER_13]: those people rise up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're trying to help a network,
you know, create that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, another thing is within our
Pure Collective, when we sat down in
[SPEAKER_05]: Garberville and we had these discussions,
bringing, you know, more people into the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry that don't have opportunity was a
really big part of our list.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are we going to help support small
farmers all over the globe be able to come
[SPEAKER_05]: into the industry and share their craft,
not only share their craft, but also
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this term Appalachia is really
only used in Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that you really can only
gain if you're, you know, run to their
[SPEAKER_05]: credibility and their, you know,
their rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might not include, you know,
a culture that's working up in Milana that
[SPEAKER_05]: has been, you know, making hash for
centuries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they deserve as farmers to be able to
have an Appalachian in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to be creating an equality
around the globe of cannabis farmers and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis culture so that they can be a
part of this industry and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way that we can do that is by
joining together and the people that have
[SPEAKER_05]: power and do have licenses right now to
start including them in on the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's exactly what we're doing in the
peer collective right now is we're
[SPEAKER_05]: including these cultures that might not
have ability to sign out applications and
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to have accreditation in banks,
to be able to have a voice and be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_16]: So well said.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, as someone who's had to navigate
the extreme learning curve of getting into
[SPEAKER_16]: this space, you know, it's to your point,
it's confusing and it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: you have to learn to trust in a way that
you've never learned to trust before.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's so many facets of this that
you're just not going to, you're not going
[SPEAKER_16]: to know about, you know, because you've
been focusing on what's really important,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is the plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's, it's really difficult to
navigate all of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really important that we do band
together.
[SPEAKER_16]: We all come together in a way that is,
is community forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we share our experiences with one
another in, in sharing how to get our
[SPEAKER_16]: plant to more people.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the industry is, you know,
I, I hope we can make it community,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, and community forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's really, truly the
only way because it's pretty intimidating
[SPEAKER_05]: to look at these really large poly
corporatics that have stepped into the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you know, they,
they are really making something of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot to learn from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can, we can even join in with them,
but it's also incredibly intimidating
[SPEAKER_05]: because, you know, they may have a staff
of 400 and they're asking us how many you
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, well, we've got four,
you know, four, four people will work for
[SPEAKER_05]: our corporation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, but then you've got another
small corporation and then another small
[SPEAKER_05]: corporation, and then you've got this huge
collective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're adding up the amount of
regenerative flower that our corporation
[SPEAKER_05]: as a group is growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all over the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it makes us feel like,
oh, okay, we've got a say in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we can truly make changes because
if we want to go make legislation,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can say, you know, this piece of
legislation, we strongly agree that you
[SPEAKER_05]: all should really, you know, get behind
because it's signed on by 70 scientists,
[SPEAKER_05]: 40 doctors, 170 farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and that really gives a,
you know, a credibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ability to be able to change the industry
from the inside out, which is,
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you, Marcus, you always talk about
that changing the industry from the inside
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a way that we can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That has incredible power.
[SPEAKER_13]: And really we have a lot of work to do
outside of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we got to find good hash strains,
you know, we're trying to get tricone
[SPEAKER_13]: heads.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's all this business, you know?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the qualitative, you know,
gets to the quantitative to tell that
[SPEAKER_16]: story.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, these people, you know,
we get, we have the knowledge that we can
[SPEAKER_16]: bring to the table to a, to let's say a
bill, for instance, is unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to be able to speak on the
plant, you know, the do's and don'ts in,
[SPEAKER_16]: in how IPM should be done.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it, it really, it stems into all
these different facets that goes way
[SPEAKER_16]: beyond numbers and, you know, bottom lines
and, and all the things that get so top
[SPEAKER_16]: line that are really secondary.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's, it's, all of that stuff in
terms of the industry, it's all about the
[SPEAKER_16]: plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you don't, you know, if you can't
actually grow the plant well, all the rest
[SPEAKER_16]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you don't know what the do's and
don'ts of that aren't, you just,
[SPEAKER_16]: it just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's where community I see has all of
the power and all of the knowledge and all
[SPEAKER_16]: of the, the resources really to share and
to really build this in the way that it
[SPEAKER_16]: really should be.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's, it's in the ornamental
that we're attempting to industrialize.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just said it, we're, we're still
finding cultivars that are really meant
[SPEAKER_16]: for making hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still going through, I, you know,
I'm still, I've been growing the same four
[SPEAKER_16]: cultivars for hash making for over two
decades at this point.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's because there's very few that
make the cut, you know, and we can spend a
[SPEAKER_16]: lifetime searching.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we had more people around like
ourselves sharing in the ideas that,
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I have this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, you should have that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get, we'll get much further.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's start right now with you telling
what four, four cultivars those are that
[SPEAKER_15]: you've been making hash with for the last
two decades.
[SPEAKER_16]: So lemon cake is one, this particular
variety of strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_16]: It has, since we've, we've sequenced it
with medicinal genomics, we've learned
[SPEAKER_16]: that there's a calio inside that variety.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a variety that is a chem dog times
OGKB.
[SPEAKER_16]: That is just, just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: That is just, it's, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have a, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I've had this, the chem dogs are
maybe a little bit, little bit less,
[SPEAKER_16]: but the other two, the lemon cake and the,
the strawberry and then this particular
[SPEAKER_16]: variety of Jack Herrera times hash plant
that is just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it just dumps.
[SPEAKER_16]: It has this like beautiful, beautiful
heads.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, and just this week,
I just, I just, you know, wash some of
[SPEAKER_16]: these varieties in a, in a, in a facility.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it just, you know, just, it reminds
me, you know, how simple it was and how
[SPEAKER_16]: complex it's gotten.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the end of the day,
we're still collecting these heads and
[SPEAKER_16]: it's, there's, there's really nothing
different here other than the process has
[SPEAKER_16]: gotten bigger.
[SPEAKER_19]: So- On that note, how about a bong rip all
you mother lovers out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus has a lot of knowledge about
varieties that perform well, collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: resin, making water hash using his bag
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has more knowledge than anybody else I
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and then with dry sipping,
there's different groups of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: have different clones that perform really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just dump the resin relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that sleet stack crossed with skunk.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a dream.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of our favorite.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Sam, yes, those varieties still are
with me now and they're growing right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're great.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we, we have really amazing hash makers
in our peer certification because we don't
[SPEAKER_13]: allow solvents in our, in our
certification and- Tetrochemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Ganja Gill and, and Brandon Kushkirk
and, and the families down there.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: But recently we've been hanging out with
Brandon and Gil a lot more.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're just amazing people.
[SPEAKER_13]: You should check them out online.
[SPEAKER_13]: They make incredible hash and,
and been also searching for hash strains
[SPEAKER_13]: and washing them a lot and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So recently we've gotten some really good,
you know, strains from them and other
[SPEAKER_13]: people in the family went out to Michigan
and gauge green.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got some really beautiful genetics from
them, but we recently just cloned a
[SPEAKER_13]: strawberry guava and a purple punch.
[SPEAKER_11]: A punch breath.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brandon was the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brandon and Amanda, they have killed it in
the garden this season.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was talking to Amanda earlier today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said to them, I can't wait to be back
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were saying like, let's just do a
hash stash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have amazing new strains.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm super excited to see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Superb.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love to hear what some of your
favorite strains is that you're coming
[SPEAKER_13]: across too in your travels.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and we, and we have them up in Canada
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, we got some Kushkirk going on
here in Amanda.
[SPEAKER_15]: Have I, have I, have you guys met each
other before Josh and Kelly, the girls in
[SPEAKER_15]: green?
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you know each other.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to hook you up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I told them I was going to introduce you
guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the end I'll give you guys like
contact.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess you guys have like entered later
presenting ourselves, but now one of like
[SPEAKER_11]: one of us I'm living actually in
California.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm a fan of you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I love, like I checked like Brandon's
garden too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I work also with sunshine.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's not like DEM certified, but she was
the one that introduced me like to you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's an amazing person and it's been
great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like to go and check out like what people
have been making because there are amazing
[SPEAKER_11]: hash strains that have been growing over
there, especially like dry farmed,
[SPEAKER_11]: like a bunch of like dry farmed love from
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredible what the dry farming
family is doing there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And sunshine is an amazing woman and,
and doing all the work at K mud,
[SPEAKER_13]: the local radio station and just an all
around awesome person.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while she's not DEM pure certified,
she certainly is a part of our collective
[SPEAKER_13]: and a part of our community and
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Jesse by a word or text, we got some
really good genetics from him this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: The GMO by, uh, uh, banana.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, S F O G banana dog.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's the banana by the black dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing that we've been really blown
away with lately, because we just really
[SPEAKER_05]: felt like we found the, uh, the unicorn on
our farm last year was a, uh, a coffee
[SPEAKER_05]: variety that we Fino hunted, you know,
massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, uh, Marcus, you saw that coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you got to smoke that and we
even did a little rosin press with that
[SPEAKER_05]: and got it, got some really nice stuff off
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we kept that varietal and we cloned
it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it's like anything else will
have any type of a, of a pathogen on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is just clean as can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem to be attacked by any type
of yeast or molds or any.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really going to start sharing
that with the community because it hashes
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is, that is a full melt certified
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got to add the full melt certified
certification on some of your D E M pure,
[SPEAKER_15]: because the cultivars that do,
you know, that melt and liquefy that's,
[SPEAKER_15]: that's full melt certified.
[SPEAKER_15]: People need to know that, that,
uh, information.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause we are going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is up?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, you can finish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could cure.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got something to say?
[SPEAKER_11]: Jump in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was going to say some strains that
I've seen here in Uruguay and Chile,
[SPEAKER_11]: because you guys are up there and I have
been like, while Alice has been living in
[SPEAKER_11]: California and well doing an amazing job
with hash making and growing plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been actually searching for things
that are happening here in South America.
[SPEAKER_11]: And recently I've come across like some
amazing hash women, hash makers in Chile,
[SPEAKER_11]: like Copa dos Anges, which is like,
the Andes cup for hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it had five Chilean.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Chilean cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It had five judges.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three of them were women.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I had never seen that here like ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And well in Uruguay Punta collective,
which are two Brazilians that have been
[SPEAKER_11]: growing there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have like made one of the best hashs
I've smoked of a very, very famous strain
[SPEAKER_11]: here in South America.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the 24 K, which is like,
yeah, super popular here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like every cup I go around here,
they some kind of, or a hash or the flower
[SPEAKER_11]: will get like first, second or third place
because here not so many people grow and
[SPEAKER_11]: like we exchange a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you see, we need to make like a seed
thing for Brazil too, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: because it is like this kind of
information that we're discussing here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that there are many Brazilians
that actually speak English, that have the
[SPEAKER_11]: privilege to speak English are watching.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a bunch of people, they grow,
they grow the seed that comes from the
[SPEAKER_11]: breed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's maybe like a land raise
kind of something from Paraguay,
[SPEAKER_11]: but they grow from that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know about phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know about selenium genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they check things on our Instagram
sometimes about hash making.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are just like doing hash with
their like trees from like plants that are
[SPEAKER_11]: not hash plants at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we bring this information,
if we manage somehow to like exchange
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds and then give this to the people,
also people are going to have information.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to start like a whole
different culture.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like a dragonfly on your arm,
by the way, if that's what I'm seeing,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's really simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they making in South America?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it water hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it tricept?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it rosin?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they doing it?
[SPEAKER_11]: The people that are doing most of them,
I feel like they're doing like solventless
[SPEAKER_11]: extraction, like solventless ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, I got to say it is a huge
privilege to be doing this here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's not everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to grow the amount that you need
to like make hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people are not like growing like six
plants in their places, like in the grow
[SPEAKER_11]: box, so they can wash it at all,
you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like no way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they wash it with the trim.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is just a little bit of hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just an experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: But a bunch of people do the dry sieve,
like the dry sieve and like some bubble
[SPEAKER_11]: bags.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are still experiencing a lot with
butane and some kind of solvents,
[SPEAKER_11]: but most people that are like competing in
cups and things like that, they have
[SPEAKER_11]: already shifted a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you see that the people that still
don't have much access to information and
[SPEAKER_11]: are like scared of not having enough out
of their trim and they could be doing
[SPEAKER_11]: something that they know that they would
have like a better amount.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like alcohol is still being used by
mothers that are producing their medicine
[SPEAKER_11]: for your kids in their house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: A bunch of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like alcohol and vape fans here in like
around Brazil are all different
[SPEAKER_11]: experiences because there's not much like
big cultivars.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard for you not to have big
cultivars for you to make a bunch of new
[SPEAKER_11]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Marcus, you did a huge educational
piece, you know, for Brazil as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that a whole bunch of people have
watched that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've done like really gotten on
ground level to really reach the
[SPEAKER_05]: Brazilians.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really commend you for that because
I took time to watch that educational
[SPEAKER_05]: piece and it was really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the feedback that we even got from
that was like awesome and telling us how
[SPEAKER_05]: great you are and the education that you
put forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Joao is doing really beautiful work.
[SPEAKER_13]: You talked about him before with Ganja
Talks and he was telling us about the
[SPEAKER_13]: Ganja there.
[SPEAKER_13]: The brick weed and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was talking about how there was,
and maybe you can elaborate on the public
[SPEAKER_13]: about how there was a boat full of Thai
weed that crashed off the coast of Brazil
[SPEAKER_13]: or something and a bunch of bags of weed
went onto the coast of Brazil and everyone
[SPEAKER_13]: said, oh, it's from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_13]: So any good weed in Brazil is called Thai
or skunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's not good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't condone this, but he said
that a lot of people just put terpenes on
[SPEAKER_13]: the brick weed in order to get like
different flavors.
[SPEAKER_13]: And really Brazilians are just learning
about different flavors.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just going to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear what you have to say about
this, but we are covering you really soon
[SPEAKER_13]: for regenerative cannabis down in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you're there.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are there, it'd be really great to
talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said it today that I'm going.
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking forward to meeting you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are kind of going on a world tour of
conscious growing and conscious living.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do all three sides of
regenerative cannabis, the one in Maine
[SPEAKER_13]: and Michigan.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also going to Hawaii to do the
Hawaii Cannabis Expo and do a whole
[SPEAKER_13]: Pakalolo Aloha tour learning about farming
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're going to, in May,
we're going to the Flame of Thrones in
[SPEAKER_13]: Ireland and learning all about the work
going on in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're doing little cups and little
conscious growing cups, the whole place.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would love to go to Brazil and South
America to bring that love and that
[SPEAKER_13]: education to there.
[SPEAKER_13]: But first of all, tell us about the weed
and Thai weed in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, Thai weed is like a very old
school way of like mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like nowadays, people smoke either the
brick weed or they smoke like some
[SPEAKER_11]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: They call it Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, well, at least that one,
you can see the butt because a bunch of
[SPEAKER_11]: people in Brazil were not educated on how
cannabis looks.
[SPEAKER_11]: If they saw a butt, they didn't know that
that was weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: They thought that that was just like a
regular plant sometimes because they
[SPEAKER_11]: thought that weed was the brick weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it shouldn't be green.
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be brown.
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be brownish.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you ever show something that it's
like a bit colorful, it's like a normal
[SPEAKER_11]: flower or something different because it
doesn't have the shape and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_11]: smell or looks like so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like in the last like five years,
people were looking for more information
[SPEAKER_11]: into cannabis, being educated about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people were like on the people are on
this drive of like wanting to grow quality
[SPEAKER_11]: weed, wanting to fight for like
regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it is so nice to be here in many
ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just I mean, just us are from South
America and like deal with like this kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of prohibitionist government in this like
this way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's crazy how much we fight for
legalizations and regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we go to California or we go to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we see the amount of issues that
actually what we have always dreamed of
[SPEAKER_11]: like will bring us like for the next
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like we see like all these
people in suits.
[SPEAKER_11]: We see like just big corporations in
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the culture as like humble,
like people growing weed for the past 30,
[SPEAKER_11]: 40 years like that, like making a bunch of
money out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have like a cannabis community
here in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is this year things changed a
bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like what he said is perfect,
but it would apply a bit for like,
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say before 2019 because this year
actually popular media started covering a
[SPEAKER_11]: bit of the benefits of medicinal cannabis
or therapeutical cannabis as we prefer to
[SPEAKER_11]: refer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we just got like therapeutical
cannabis legalized.
[SPEAKER_11]: Many, many quotes there because it's like
only imported super expensive only for
[SPEAKER_11]: like only an oil maybe like only separated
compound like the separated cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: like very less than 0.3% of THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very from the pharmaceutical industry,
you know, like not as like we could create
[SPEAKER_11]: a community of like people growing it in a
very sustainable way in a very
[SPEAKER_11]: regenerative farm like in a farm like
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But not yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we hope that we can bring that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So once this happens, this happens with
regulations, people can start growing like
[SPEAKER_11]: sustainably.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's very, there's very important
research in cannabinoids that have been
[SPEAKER_17]: done in Brazil, in Sao Paulo for years.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the original study that Mishulam
worked on to show its efficacy against
[SPEAKER_17]: epilepsy was done in the late 70s and
early 80s in Sao Paulo.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just posted in our chat here a very
important study that shows the connection
[SPEAKER_17]: between CBD and traumatic brain injury
memory that again could be the thing that
[SPEAKER_17]: underpins PTSD treatment.
[SPEAKER_17]: So truth be told, there's been cannabinoid
research going on in Brazil for years.
[SPEAKER_17]: And these centers of excellence have
generated very important data that show,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, clinical and preclinical
efficacy of cannabinoids to treat a number
[SPEAKER_17]: of disorders, including epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nowadays, there's been a study being made
in Brazil too with like CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you guys understand, like all of
this cannabinoids are not like grown here
[SPEAKER_11]: or made here.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're normally imported from America or
Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they get a permit so they can import
the substance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only CBD, even psychedelic research,
like they managed to import MDMA already.
[SPEAKER_11]: They managed to import LSD already.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there have been some researchers like
like that, but it's always imported.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they're making one with people
that have, well, some drug abuse with
[SPEAKER_11]: crack.
[SPEAKER_17]: So people from North America come down to
Brazil for ayahuasca treatment.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know two people who claim that they
would be dead if they did not go to Brazil
[SPEAKER_17]: for their ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that that's been commercialized in
some ways, shapes and forms of people are
[SPEAKER_17]: making money off the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I mean, if you think about it,
I mean, why would we limit ourselves just
[SPEAKER_17]: to, you know, the elements of ayahuasca or
cannabis when there's a whole rainforest
[SPEAKER_17]: of possibilities of different medicinally
active plants and, and compounds that we
[SPEAKER_17]: haven't even discovered yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's part of the reason why I think
we need to, you know, work like crazy
[SPEAKER_17]: until they, you know, get rid of all of
the rainforest to make sure that we we've
[SPEAKER_17]: made all the discoveries of life-saving
medicines before it all goes away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I think that, you know,
again, I, there is a program down there to
[SPEAKER_17]: look at that, but you think somehow Brazil
and the government should be able to
[SPEAKER_17]: exploit this basically pharmaceutical
company that exists in the rainforest of
[SPEAKER_17]: all these unknown medicines that are yet
to be discovered.
[SPEAKER_17]: And therein lies economic empowerment and
opportunity for jobs and certainly new
[SPEAKER_17]: medicines from biology as opposed from,
you know, drug companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our government right now is crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And doesn't invest in science,
doesn't invest in new talents,
[SPEAKER_11]: like the good people, like they want to
study, they want to, we even have someone
[SPEAKER_11]: that we really like that was on the TV
show here this week.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a neuroscientist and he studies
cannabis and dreams.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like he's a very crazy dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was actually on psychedelic science in
California presenting a bit of his work
[SPEAKER_11]: too.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said that scientists, like people that
do research, they are just leaving Brazil
[SPEAKER_11]: because we have no room for this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like scientists and teachers, they're
paying from their own pocket because they
[SPEAKER_09]: don't get like,
[SPEAKER_11]: what I just said that happened,
happened through a loophole, which is like
[SPEAKER_11]: FDA from America, like for our sanitarian
agency saying, look, there is no way
[SPEAKER_11]: there's like at least 7,000 kids who I
already import them CBD or THC or
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever, or both of them, because they
are going to die or they have like this
[SPEAKER_11]: proven cases, which are, they need to use
this medically.
[SPEAKER_11]: So even, and then the government,
when they were voting, they changed the
[SPEAKER_11]: board.
[SPEAKER_11]: They fired two people from the original
board and put two militars.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we still passed it, but like with
many, many quotes, as we said,
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's what's happening here in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have some very, very beautiful
studies, like Cedar Taideiro and
[SPEAKER_11]: scientists working, but they are getting
from like sometimes private investment,
[SPEAKER_11]: sometimes they're in their own pockets
right now because the government
[SPEAKER_11]: investment is even hard here for research.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just like a bunch of people that
are migrating from Brazil to study
[SPEAKER_11]: outside.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's, it's hard to be here doing
this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, they want to keep it
separated.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I mean, that's the thing,
you know, keep it separated, keep it
[SPEAKER_13]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So then they can capitalize on the good
information that's brought.
[SPEAKER_13]: So really that's fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's the way that it is, it just
takes people and the citizens and educated
[SPEAKER_13]: intelligence to rise up and create
programs that are undeniable, ones that
[SPEAKER_13]: make sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't say that the government paved
the way for MAPS to do their work.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that MAPS paved their own way to
do their work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now they're doing work that's
undeniable that the government can't do
[SPEAKER_13]: anything about because it's now become a
human rights issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think once we start using words like
human rights and here we are, we're taking
[SPEAKER_13]: our own power back and you know,
we're doing this through intelligence and
[SPEAKER_13]: through education that I think that we
just have to continue to be smarter and
[SPEAKER_13]: more intelligent than what's being
presented to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet again, like we continue to say is
that the, you know, the cannabis plant is
[SPEAKER_05]: an incredible catalyst to push us and
catapult us forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I love to separate the word
community to come unity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's really powerful
because it's now is the time that we need
[SPEAKER_05]: to start unifying as cannabis culture all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know who we are, no matter what
color we are, no matter what socioeconomic
[SPEAKER_05]: background we come from.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are somebody who uses cannabis,
you are part of the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it is time for us to come
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and also just a side note on,
you know, I, I don't, I don't really know
[SPEAKER_05]: very many governments that aren't crazy
right now really against their,
[SPEAKER_05]: their own people is listening to their own
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're hitting an incredible mass and an
incredible crisis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I truly believe that the cannabis
plant is making her, her announcement and
[SPEAKER_05]: making her way into the world because of
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just, you know, something that's
happening by coincidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all psychedelics are starting
to, to come out into mainstream culture
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabis is coming out into mainstream
culture because it is time for us as a
[SPEAKER_05]: critical mass to start questioning the
rules and the regulations of government.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's not think about our borders in
our countries, even though we do have to
[SPEAKER_13]: live within the regulations that are being
given to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we forget about the borders and
create common language, I think we're
[SPEAKER_13]: going to become stronger as an
international group.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that can be done through education for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing we don't have though,
like here we are, a few of us in
[SPEAKER_06]: California, our California program has
become widely known for its failures as
[SPEAKER_06]: much as its successes, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just, just this week, a couple of
things happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bureau of Cannabis Control decided
that they're going to run taxation
[SPEAKER_06]: differently, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be done at distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're moving it to retail part of
it's a big part of it's moving to retail
[SPEAKER_06]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the governor just put out this
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, this is a short story.
[SPEAKER_06]: The program's all messed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be doing a bunch of things to
fix it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're considering cutting
cultivation tax at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've stacked so many taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Equity is still a big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a model that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just don't, you know, we can target
disadvantaged neighborhoods and stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but I don't know how we're going to
do this thing and make it work.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for example, we don't have a model to
share with each other that builds on our
[SPEAKER_06]: problems and our successes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we can't provide our cohorts in South
America or Central America who need model
[SPEAKER_06]: legislation or even just send us a list of
facts.
[SPEAKER_06]: What worked and doesn't work, you know,
we don't have that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what we do have though, Debbie,
and I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like any time that, you know,
a government is involved and we have as
[SPEAKER_05]: many problems as we have solutions,
you know, unfortunately, because
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations are so steep.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we do have is we have the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have written SOPs on how you can run a
five acre farm that we can share with
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have SOPs on, on how to, how to create
healthy extractions, ones that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, are both medicinal and for the
recreational market as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we can continue to share.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the every bit of work that we do in the
cannabis community and inside of these,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, markets that we're living in
around the world, we can share with each
[SPEAKER_05]: other.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that really gives a step up to the
people
[SPEAKER_09]: from countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut out and then you stop talking.
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_17]: Did we lose her?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think she was done talking,
but she froze just for the last little
[SPEAKER_15]: bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're moving again.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_15]: We heard most of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Creating a repository for open source data
sharing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we don't know where to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know where to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the early days of the internet,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that how they did it?
[SPEAKER_06]: There was all the corporate guys and then
there were the people creating things like
[SPEAKER_06]: the well and creating these big open
source versus data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody can grow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Debbie, Debbie, can I share an
analogy when, when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_17]: an experience, like creating an
experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it reminded me of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, maybe it's because I'm
wearing a Jerry Garcia shirt.
[SPEAKER_17]: It reminded me of a Grateful Dead concert,
you know, that there were certain things
[SPEAKER_17]: that were going to be the same,
but there were certain things that were
[SPEAKER_17]: different every time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it created a unique experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I keep on throwing this Grateful Dead
analogy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And even like their business model,
which was so counter, like what the record
[SPEAKER_17]: industry wanted them to do, which was to
sell records.
[SPEAKER_17]: They sold tickets because the magic was
created in front of human beings.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Jerry Garcia used to say,
you can't manufacture intensity,
[SPEAKER_17]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't just go into the studio,
turn on the knobs and automatically just
[SPEAKER_17]: be intense, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: They did that in front of an audience of
people.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it went back to the acid test days of
where they made this connection with their
[SPEAKER_17]: audience to really transport.
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, when you said that,
I haven't really been paying much
[SPEAKER_17]: attention to anything other than this
analogy.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I wanted to share it with you,
but I just, you know, I was so lucky to
[SPEAKER_17]: grow up at the right time and live in the
right place to see the band during the
[SPEAKER_17]: seventies and the eighties.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was just such a magical
transportation.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_17]: And cannabis was a big undercurrent on
dead tour.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, there's so many, so many stories
like the chem dog story from deer Creek 91
[SPEAKER_17]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, you couldn't get good weed on
the East coast.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was brick weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just, just horrible stuff that was
smuggled in gas tanks out to the East
[SPEAKER_17]: coast market.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was easier to buy.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was easier to buy cocaine than it was
to buy weed in New York.
[SPEAKER_17]: The only place we found good weed was out
on grateful dead tour.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's because all my heavy friends from
NorCal would, would, would be on the road
[SPEAKER_17]: bringing their weed and, and everyone knew
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when the grateful dead played at a
venue, you could have got hassled at the
[SPEAKER_17]: Neil Young show or at the, at the Zeppelin
show.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm old enough to have seen
Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like, you know, you could go to a
grateful dead show and automatically
[SPEAKER_17]: you're allowed to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: No one's getting busted for smoking weed
because it was just the grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just part of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was always dank nor California
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a good friend who I got weed from in
the late eighties out on grateful dead
[SPEAKER_17]: tour.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope he's still around Ron from
Shasta, Ron, the pizza man.
[SPEAKER_17]: He had a pizza oven in the back of an old
a Connell line van and would make pizza.
[SPEAKER_17]: He would make pizza out on the grateful
dead parking lot scene.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just such a cool place,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So my association again, with this
transportation thing was back to my days
[SPEAKER_17]: as a spun out kid on dead tour,
but really it was the smell of weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just like, like even like today,
I mean, you could go to shows and you
[SPEAKER_17]: smell dank weed being smoked.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you knew that that was sort of like
the bridge and Jerry loved good weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, I think the Garcia state recently
has partnered up with a production
[SPEAKER_17]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were bound to, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: So there'll be some Garcia branded
products out there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking at Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you guys know tricks.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not grass family too, cause they
really raised up, you know, a community
[SPEAKER_13]: out of, out of, out of the ashes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's say I had a personalized,
grateful dead snot grass bowl back in the
[SPEAKER_17]: days.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's somewhere in my collection.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's smash.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I got to get it fixed again.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I mean, it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just that whole thread that to me,
I mean, I saw the dad and an early age and
[SPEAKER_17]: I really didn't know what I was seeing
when I was seeing it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I go back to Debbie's analogy of it
being a, a transportation from the
[SPEAKER_05]: grateful dead was open source.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every single bit of it was open
source and, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it sort of to reflect on what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't have made it through university
of Oregon without, you know, swinging bags
[SPEAKER_05]: of weed at every single show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm so grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at least I had the good stuff
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there at Ken Kesey's farm on 4th of
July with Jerry in 1990 by the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's smoked his very first bud out of
a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked at that moment about the
importance of cannabis and community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like that would like really
settled in me and it, and it made me know
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah, this is where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the weed that I was swinging
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, you know, I think there's,
there's grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Snodgrass family.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's Oregon country fair, which started
in the 1969, which was to create a new,
[SPEAKER_13]: the new world that doesn't rely on the
regular system and know the Quakers also
[SPEAKER_13]: did amazing things in the world too,
that came out of California and did
[SPEAKER_13]: different things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rainbow family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget the rainbow family.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fun bringing people together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to mention that the way that I met
Sam, this is a grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way back in the day in the nineties,
when I was a young advocate, somehow I got
[SPEAKER_06]: into this popular magazine and his
business partner saw it in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in the article it said,
Oh, Debbie's on great collector.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll always find her in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'd be where I met you was on
telegraph.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met you even earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were sitting at one of those can
booths.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the corner of telegraph
enchanting way pulls up in his car.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you've met him, you know,
he just got in his car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next thing I know, we're taking off to
this Japanese kimono.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they have these traditional hemp
kimonos that were on display.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were glorious.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted me to see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't even believe how beautiful they
were.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the, in the early day when there
was no hemp products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly we're in Berkeley looking at
these beautiful hemp kimonos on the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We go even way, way, way back.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember Michael finding us on the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he gave me two things just pops out of
the blue, like a, like a very,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, Michael was a serious dead end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I saw them four or five times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, what was the first year you saw the
dead?
[SPEAKER_17]: 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: 77.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, uh, 78.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, uh, um, uh, yeah, my first Brent
show was the fourth show I saw in 79.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, uh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 14 years old, which was real near
to, uh, Ken Teezy's, uh, farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, up on the summit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where did you see him skunk man?
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it in Vanita, Oregon?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, not in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when he still lived near,
uh, up, uh, near summit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Road in Santa Cruz, California.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I see down by the La Honda property.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: My first for Jesse on BioHortex.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm pretty sure his family's still in that
zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: My first show was Alpine Valley,
1986.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my first show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my first show.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super quick story about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time I ever took mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went with my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, um, I didn't have tickets.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost my shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost my ticket on the way on the way
into the event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost my friends for the whole weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was miracle all three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody gave me a pair of shoes and I
helped this awesome couple sell vegetarian
[SPEAKER_05]: chili out of their RV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they gave me a place to sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, family, I am here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on her way out on the third day,
she finds her friends hitchhiking on the
[SPEAKER_13]: way out and doesn't see them all weekend.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is an awesome story.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Bob Dylan and Tom Petty were touring
with the Grateful Dead at the time.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we went the night before they played
at the Hubert Humphrey Dome in
[SPEAKER_17]: Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then the next night was a Saturday night
and the dead said, no, Alpine Valley is
[SPEAKER_17]: our own gig.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Tom Petty and Bob Dylan played the
night before the two dead shows in 86.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so did you guys camp out for that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of us were just out in the parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_17]: No one bought tickets to go see Tom Petty
or Bob Dylan.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, imagine that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't, but that was in Milwaukee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't they play a gig in Milwaukee the
night before?
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they played at Alpine Valley the night
before the dead played and the dead
[SPEAKER_17]: refused to split up their shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like, no, Alpine Valley is our
gig.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's funny because at a couple stops
along that tour, 86 was a great gig.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a great year, except Jerry getting
sick, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: The dead actually warmed up for Petty and
Dylan.
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we saw them in Minneapolis,
the dead went on first and played one long
[SPEAKER_17]: set, which was very unusual for the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_17]: Didn't warm up for anybody, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is Tom Petty and Bob Dylan.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was a big, big production.
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of people actually, after the
dead got done playing in Minneapolis,
[SPEAKER_17]: they just packed up left, didn't even stay
for the Bob Dylan, Tom Petty show.
[SPEAKER_17]: We stayed for Bob Dylan, Tom Petty,
but then drove through the night.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the next night, Bob Dylan and Tom
Petty played Alpine by themselves one
[SPEAKER_17]: night.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the dead played the next two
nights, which was great.
[SPEAKER_17]: Those shows were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Recordings of them are wonderful,
you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, trouble had Jerry in red.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was about to get sick.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't stop grilled cheese markets in
the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't have a Tom Petty and a Bob Dylan
show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_17]: You probably get busted for smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't record.
[SPEAKER_17]: See, that was a big thing too,
is that, you know, Bob Dylan does not
[SPEAKER_17]: allow recording and the Grateful Dead
allow recording.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was the taping section.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a big thing at those shows.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's very little, I guess, recorded
stuff of some of the Dylan stuff because
[SPEAKER_17]: he didn't want people recording.
[SPEAKER_17]: But as you know, kind of going with the
Grateful Dead business model, we were
[SPEAKER_17]: discussing before, they let people tape
their shows.
[SPEAKER_17]: And through those tapes, they became the
most recorded band in all of human
[SPEAKER_17]: history.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's more Grateful Dead recordings on
this planet than any other band ever.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's no way anyone could even come
close because if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_17]: all the people who taped, then there's
second generation, third generation.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's so many copies, people's cassettes
probably getting moldy in their basements.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the most recorded band in all human
history.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, one thing that's really cool
about that is all those tapes and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that was done was done on an
honor system.
[SPEAKER_13]: No person was ever allowed to sell a tape.
[SPEAKER_17]: Open source.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Kelly said, open source.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you caught someone selling a bootleg in
the fucking parking lot, they might as
[SPEAKER_13]: well go move to fucking somewhere no one
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like a narc.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also about narcs, like the one great
thing about a Grateful Dead parking lot is
[SPEAKER_13]: you can score the best weed, the best
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: The best asset, whatever good thing that
you wanted that was for family.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there was ever a cop in the parking
lot, there was some guy 20 feet out in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of him going, narc, narc,
FBI, narc, this guy's a narc.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a great excuse when you do get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, where did you get that son?
[SPEAKER_17]: We're trying to draw your story.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I bought it on the parking lot of a
Grateful Dead show from some hippie in a
[SPEAKER_17]: tie dye.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always tell them I got it from this cop,
dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's right over there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll point him out.
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought it from an undercover cop.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not even an undercover, fully in uniform.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was him right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw one of my first dead events,
it was an acid test in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_17]: LSD was still legal.
[SPEAKER_17]: So which acid test were you at,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_17]: I was on one on Sunset Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so was that the Watts acid test?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Watts was, I was around there too,
but I didn't hang out long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I visited and then I left.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Jerry Garcia talks about the Watts acid
test in the movie, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the movie he recalls.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole lot of soul people got their souls
really, really electrified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it the Fillmore acid test,
cunk man?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're talking about the one I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was right on Sunset Boulevard and you
walked in and they had a big bowl of
[SPEAKER_03]: Kool-Aid and you took one cup of Kool-Aid
and it costs $5 to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it costs nothing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, five bucks was like 50 bucks now,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, five bucks back then, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: That's actually a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: You got breakfast though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they gave you, they gave you a
cup of acid also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well that's, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can get Carolyn Garcia on here to tell
us everything there is to know about this
[SPEAKER_13]: and it would be really cool to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone should know about Mountain
Girl Botanicals if we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_13]: about Grateful Dead and cannabis,
because she.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always liked her book, The Primo Plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going to have her on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you guys remember that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, I know she's thinking about it
because listen, she literally called me
[SPEAKER_15]: out of the blue one day and I don't know
her.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is Caroline, this is
Mountain Girl.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, oh, hey, this is the
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, right, right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when are we going to do that Hash
Church?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Josh and Kelly, break it down for
the audience who Mountain Girl is.
[SPEAKER_17]: They may not know who that is.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sort of a code name.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I mean, Mountain Girl is Carolyn
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_13]: She was an amazing woman who was on the
scene at the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she had a daughter.
[SPEAKER_13]: She has a daughter named Sunshine with Ken
Kesey.
[SPEAKER_05]: A love child in the early 60s when they
went down to Mexico to step out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole regime of the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they went down to live and join a whole
new culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on the legal run.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then got together with Jerry
afterwards and had Annabel and Trixie,
[SPEAKER_13]: amazing ladies who are in the community
now doing incredible work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Annabel is an amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_13]: Trixie does amazing work all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another friend of mine in California's
father was a judge that sentenced Kesey
[SPEAKER_03]: for that crime.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why he was on the run for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This son was a stone cold smoking man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, honestly, I think that we can
almost just let Carolyn describe herself
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're going to be down in Oregon
here really soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll just like the problem she was
having was with technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can just help her out with that and
have her on with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that her father was a botanist.
[SPEAKER_13]: She grew up, you know, loving gardens and
loving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she's always been a person who just
really soaks up information.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we really love about her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's incredibly intelligent.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she did write one of the first
cannabis growing books in 1916.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a very outdoor organic growing kind
of book.
[SPEAKER_09]: Frozen up here or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, maybe we continue to talk
about how we're recreating history.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be in Eugene actually in a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could get Bob Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Carolyn Garcia in the same room.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could do a hasher.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob Snodgrass used to come out on hemp
tour with us in the day touring around and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing hemp festivals.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to the fact he was on dead
tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we took him out with Jack
Herrera and LV Musica and hit the road
[SPEAKER_06]: doing college campuses and big cities back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Debbie, where were you living in 1986 for
that to have been your first show?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because I was a college kid in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking 86 smoked weed for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: First Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe me, the LSD and VW bus were just
minutes behind and minutes behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you Midwestern?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to Lake Forest High School in
Illinois on the North Shore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that show, I got grounded for an
entire month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was supposed to be babysitting like at a
lake somewhere and a fully ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it was worth all,
however many months I was grounded for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was worth it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was in Michigan Tech and UP.
[SPEAKER_17]: So for us, it was maybe like about an
eight hour drive, but it was like our
[SPEAKER_17]: closest shows.
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw him in Madison, Dane County.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they played in Madison and also
saw him in Poplar Creek.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to say there was like 1984 maybe in
Poplar Creek, but that was like suburban
[SPEAKER_17]: Chicago.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I was also at Brent slash Tinley Park,
which is just outside of Chicago too as
[SPEAKER_17]: well.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and a bunch of Soldier Field shows.
[SPEAKER_17]: I asked my wife to marry me.
[SPEAKER_17]: First night of Soldier Field.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that the one that Sting opened up for
him on and they had the big thunder and
[SPEAKER_13]: lightning storm?
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to clear the whole main floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was exciting.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that was, that was, that was in 93.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sting was 93, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: This was, they were rolling with the Dave
Matthews band was the warmup.
[SPEAKER_17]: Crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: They had some crazy warmups.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, it was traffic in 94,
Sting in 93, Steve Miller in 92 and
[SPEAKER_17]: Santana in 91.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was such great years.
[SPEAKER_17]: We really didn't know how good we had it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dave Matthews was pretty killer in 93,
94, 95.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had a raw, well, Under the Table in
Dreaming came out in 95.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I remember being on Fish Tour in like
93, 94 on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did the Halloween show in 94 and I did
like the Bangor Main where they did the 30
[SPEAKER_15]: minute tweezer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I did like a Syracuse show and some
other ones.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I got turned on to Dave Matthews out
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were at some, we were at some same
shows together and we didn't know it,
[SPEAKER_17]: did we?
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't know each other.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, no, we must have though been at
the same shows together.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Henry Schwab, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: So were you going with those guys?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I knew Henry, you know, I would
always go see him at the Waterwheel table
[SPEAKER_15]: and whatnot, but dude, I was traveling in
India.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was at the Kumbh Mela, the Maha Kumbh
Mela in Haridwar, India in like seriously
[SPEAKER_15]: in the North.
[SPEAKER_17]: These were your dready years, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 kilometers away from Kumbh Mukesh.
[SPEAKER_15]: But listen to this, this is super trippy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I bumped into Henry like in a tiny little
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was sitting at a table.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was like three tables in this whole
little place and I looked beside me and
[SPEAKER_15]: it's fucking Henry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm looking at him like, I'm like,
I've never seen this person outside of the
[SPEAKER_15]: fish Waterwheel foundation table,
like ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even think I ever saw him in the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I seen him a lot.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then he was sitting next to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And while this was happening
simultaneously, the two people that we
[SPEAKER_15]: were traveling with were doing it with
each other as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: They had traveled to Asia together for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: The guy I was traveling with, Alex and the
girl he was traveling with, they knew each
[SPEAKER_15]: other.
[SPEAKER_15]: Me and Henry knew each other.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we didn't know, like Alex didn't know
Henry and I didn't know the girl Henry was
[SPEAKER_15]: traveling with.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was super trippy.
[SPEAKER_15]: At least the psychedelic as high as I
would be when I would see him at the table
[SPEAKER_15]: and like have a 20 minute conversation
with him or whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Were all four of you there for the Kumbh
Mela?
[SPEAKER_15]: They were not there for the Maha Kumbh
Mela.
[SPEAKER_15]: We told them about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The girl knew all about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Henry was just like, dude,
I'm just trying to, you know, be somewhere
[SPEAKER_15]: other than official.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, really it wasn't until Jerry
died that we decided, wow, we could
[SPEAKER_13]: probably move.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we would have never moved while
the Grateful Dead were alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Jerry died in 95 and we were working
and doing midwifery and herbalism and
[SPEAKER_13]: building.
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of a sudden, I got a job building
two yurts in Nileston, B.C.
[SPEAKER_13]: in 1998 in May.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we went in the Holy Smoke Shop and
smoked hash oil in town.
[SPEAKER_15]: Off the mayor?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, those are my, those are my boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to meet my friends upon opening
our VW bus for the first time.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Paul D, Alan Middlemas,
Dustin Sunflower.
[SPEAKER_15]: Amazing, amazing people.
[SPEAKER_15]: The first time I went to the Kootenays was
in the early 90s, like 91.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hooked up with those guys and we
went and like prepared organic soil and
[SPEAKER_15]: mixed our own soils.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we went and dug holes in the mountain
and we planted plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was my first time growing outdoors
and it was really their grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was just happy to help and to be
like, be with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were just such an amazing,
they are such amazing people.
[SPEAKER_15]: So shout out to all of those guys for
being such good folks.
[SPEAKER_15]: They also, we shared a booth at a
psychedelics conference in Whistler and
[SPEAKER_15]: where we actually met Finn McKenna and
Paul Stamets came by and hung out.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just this really super cool little
mini psychedelic event in Whistler,
[SPEAKER_15]: BC of all places.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did it with the Holy Smokes guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: We shared.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they went on to Dustin Sunflower
had shows on the radio every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the amount of intelligent
exploration that happened here in Nelson,
[SPEAKER_13]: BC then and still now is truly phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Nelson is an amazing town.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pioneers, pioneers of the mop up trip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, people came here to draft the
dodge, dodge the draft, whatever it was
[SPEAKER_13]: called, and learn how to survive and grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and it's a potent group of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always say now at the time that we
came in, you know, in the late nineties
[SPEAKER_05]: that we came up as cannabis refugees
because so much, you know, there was guns
[SPEAKER_05]: happening in Southern Oregon and in
Northern Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we were a big time part of
the cannabis industry at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had just had a, you know,
a small child and we thought, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we could go up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do our craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can, we can grow outdoors in nature and
really continue to make medicine without
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, all the heavy artillery
and the heavy energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to come up here to BC and then become
Canadian citizens, you know, as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: refugee is, you know, it's an important
part of our story because we really felt
[SPEAKER_05]: like following the medicine and growing
and cultivating the best medicine that we
[SPEAKER_05]: can.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like it was, you know, those
grateful dead years and those psychedelic
[SPEAKER_13]: years and those herbalist years of
gathering mushrooms and being in the wood.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it was like, it was church,
you know, like it, it set up a dedication
[SPEAKER_13]: that is like going to be set in our souls
for the rest of our life.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's been set in our lives before we
feel like it's been set in our eyes in the
[SPEAKER_13]: future.
[SPEAKER_13]: And coming up here allowed us to really
embody that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that whole, that whole psychedelic
thing was important for me as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was, I went to the school of,
you know, originally I was into all these
[SPEAKER_15]: different sort of conspiracy novels and I
liked Robert Anton Wilson and that sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: led me into Terrence McKenna.
[SPEAKER_15]: And once I got the Terrence McKenna,
like Esselam Institute, like recordings
[SPEAKER_15]: with Rupert Sheldrake and Ralph Abraham
from like the mid eighties to late
[SPEAKER_15]: eighties, I was very, very, very stoked on
that at a young age and started,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, Mike, you know, hype macro
dosing the five grams dried and ordering
[SPEAKER_15]: spores from Terrence and Kat in Hawaii and
growing our own, I guess it was a sygeny.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's important to make note that Vancouver
and British Columbia has an equal
[SPEAKER_13]: importance as the stuff that's happened in
Oregon and California.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's almost like what can't happen
there happened here and what can't happen
[SPEAKER_13]: here happened there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And somehow they're both balancing each
other out to become the better situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've really appreciated being able to
you know, we're basically a product of
[SPEAKER_13]: British Columbia and Oregon at this point.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it feels really good to be able to
just embody what's right as a human.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Canadians just always pushing the
envelope up here to make way and headway
[SPEAKER_05]: for what's been going on down in the
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Josh said, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big ups to the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big up to radical human beings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, I guess we'll just extend.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big up to radical human beings on the
earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also, you know, got an awesome
chance to be able to meet Terrence McKenna
[SPEAKER_05]: to when I was in KL Kekua Bay,
you know, five o'clock in the morning,
[SPEAKER_05]: five days in a row.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sort of took me on the second day,
like, wait, this is Terrence McKenna.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognize his voice, you know,
from late night radio when there before
[SPEAKER_05]: there was internet, you know, we used to
listen to the super late night radio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and he got to download, you know,
hours and hours of what he was up to at
[SPEAKER_05]: that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really sent me on a whole new
journey to be able to convene with,
[SPEAKER_05]: with his energy and where I really wanted
to go in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I know we're all big up in
Terrence, but I'm going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, when we, we started growing
commercially here in 99 outdoors and
[SPEAKER_13]: started seeing the outdoor British
Columbian genetics and growing the white
[SPEAKER_13]: grizzly from the Kootenays really allowed
us to see a lot of different genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we recognize now that we had Otto
flower genetics happening in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had Hayes genetics happening in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing hash genetics, that Nepali strain
that people talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus, I know you remember that one,
you know, that Nepali or Nepalese people
[SPEAKER_05]: called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was incredible, beautiful hash strain.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of my favorites from the Kootenays
from back in like that 91, 92 era was
[SPEAKER_15]: called the A1 Magenta.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you ever see Dustin or Paul,
ask them about the A1 Magenta.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you, that was a special,
special, special plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And forever British Columbia was locked
into one strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that it's, it's beyond that
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you hear about it in Brazil,
like, oh, that was, that was back in the
[SPEAKER_13]: day when it was all Thai and skunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's changed now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, well, here in British
Columbia, you know, it may have used to
[SPEAKER_13]: all be rocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was in Seoul, but I do see a lot of
people making big switch to just exploring
[SPEAKER_13]: strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I like to see that here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's a tide that can't be
changed now and that the world has awoken
[SPEAKER_13]: to cannabis as a chemo var or as a
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really excited that we can move
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of our hard work that we put in as
cannabis community before now can really
[SPEAKER_05]: relate to everybody in Canada that can
grow their four plants outside that are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to finish outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter where you are in Canada,
you're going to have beautiful finishes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have amazing outdoor
genetics that when you experience this
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine, you're going to have a really
good experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're huge advocates for everybody
growing their four.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, big ups to all of the
cannabis community in Canada that's been
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding, you know, since the eighties,
you know, we were even standing on the
[SPEAKER_05]: backs of giants that, you know,
we got the genetics from the elders,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, at that time we're in their late
seventies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we took that breeding and then
bred for another 20 years that we can now
[SPEAKER_05]: pass on to regular people that are growing
their four plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just an incredible stride.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to challenge people to grow four
food plants and maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_13]: So with your four plants, take that
opportunity to grow food along with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's take on the whole idea of
victory gardens or the whole idea of us
[SPEAKER_13]: all having a little bit of food grown so
that we can live in an abundant culture
[SPEAKER_13]: and an abundant society rather than the
scarcity one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to see your big ganja colas,
but we also want to see your big massive
[SPEAKER_05]: zucchini too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or your holy basil growing underneath.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like part of the regulation that
you guys just brought up is being able to
[SPEAKER_11]: cultivate at home.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's, it's, it's a ride for everyone
and everyone should be able to be in touch
[SPEAKER_11]: with their medicine and understand how the
plant works and then see like sprout a
[SPEAKER_11]: seed for different first time plan,
like make a bunch of mistakes,
[SPEAKER_11]: like water too much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this is the most important step
towards like yourself making a medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that we have to
fight still a bunch in Brazil,
[SPEAKER_11]: unfortunately here we have 60 people
growing weed legally in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not even, yeah, 50 something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They, they, they had to apply.
[SPEAKER_11]: They had to go individually.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the justice to fight for themselves,
you know, say I have a condition and I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: planting weed already and this is good for
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they get, you know, but it's just
not a thing here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how beautiful it would be if everyone
could grow their own four or their own
[SPEAKER_11]: six, like in California outdoors,
like every, like people could see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We wouldn't have this amount of like
indoor grows with a bunch of like crazy
[SPEAKER_11]: electrical like I don't even know how to
say that in English.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, like when you, when you,
when you get the fire hazard, very poorly
[SPEAKER_11]: made electrical like grows that are
dangerous for a house that can put up a
[SPEAKER_11]: house on fire sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause that's what we see here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it will be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow four plants outdoors,
you should be able to get eight kilos
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaned and dried.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would also like to say, you could have
four root stocks and graft other strains
[SPEAKER_13]: onto it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you could potentially, let's say have
four different strains on one root stock
[SPEAKER_03]: and still be able to have 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had 25.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course you have Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course you have.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had 30 once, but I don't want to talk
about it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Four plants in Italy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to hear a little bit more about
the 25 different cultivars that you
[SPEAKER_15]: grafted onto a plant though, Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that all about now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first what we did was we just tried
grafting and that was successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we put two and the next year we
did 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next year most I ever put on one
root stock was 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing you have to do is you have
to make sure your root stock is later
[SPEAKER_03]: maturing than the grafts that you're
putting on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise the whole plant dies before the
final plants are done maturing branches.
[SPEAKER_15]: Timeline wise, would this have been after
the publishing of marijuana botany?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, because I didn't move to Holland
till after marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I wasn't sure if you did some of
this in Cali or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I did a little bit of cloning in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't a big believer in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that if you made a copy of a
copy of a copy, it's separate from Xerox
[SPEAKER_03]: effect, which I found out not to be true.
[SPEAKER_13]: So were you grafting skunk one through
skunk 25?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was grafting both male and female
branches onto a late maturing root stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times I try to use hazes as a
root stock because they're later maturing
[SPEAKER_03]: than any of the grafts that I put on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted the grafts to finish before
the root stock died.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's super smart.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were having a really amazing... You're
breaking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if everybody's hearing you
break up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard it was breaking up for me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that was good was when
people had a plant in it, like here in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Netherlands, you can grow five plants in
your balcony or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you've got five plants and each
one of them has got 20, 25 different
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic branches on them, then you
actually are keeping a library of 100
[SPEAKER_09]: plus.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I was just typing to someone in
the... That's quite all right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was Jan from New York.
[SPEAKER_15]: You might have even met him before,
but he said he's glad Sam clarified the
[SPEAKER_15]: cloning does not decrease.
[SPEAKER_15]: He said it doesn't, but if your plant is
plagued with virus, fungi, and microbials,
[SPEAKER_15]: and it's been impregnated with thousands
of these, it can appear to be that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's where that whole like,
oh, it's genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they take up a viral load, or a fungal
load, or a bacterial load, then their
[SPEAKER_03]: yields are bigger, can be greatly,
greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Marcus, could I ask the girls from
Brazil just a quick question?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the regulation in Brazil Brazil is
a very large country with large cities,
[SPEAKER_17]: and a large economy, and large natural
resources, and certainly the presence of
[SPEAKER_17]: industrial agriculture is all over the
place down there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where is the law in Brazil?
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you possess, or can you have,
or do you go to jail, or is it
[SPEAKER_17]: municipality dependent?
[SPEAKER_17]: What advice would you give tourists who
want to go down there and get high?
[SPEAKER_11]: For tourists wanting to get high,
it is very tough to find good quality
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis or hash in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to be very close to a specific
niche.
[SPEAKER_11]: Instagram helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a tourist, and you're a stoner,
and you get in touch on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_11]: it helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: With the legislation in Brazil,
you want to talk a bit about the
[SPEAKER_11]: legislation?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a criminal offense.
[SPEAKER_11]: To have under 20 grams, to possess under
20 grams, if you're white.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything has to do with how the police
officer that gets you, interprets the
[SPEAKER_11]: situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our drug policy, unfortunately,
opened up the room for a bunch of racism,
[SPEAKER_11]: in fact, for the interpretation of the
police officer to be whatever is going to
[SPEAKER_11]: come out for that situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: If he interprets as drug trafficking,
or if he does not, or if he's just drug
[SPEAKER_11]: user, just sign up, and then you have to
present yourself in the court,
[SPEAKER_11]: and then you have your first offense,
but then it's your first, but it all
[SPEAKER_11]: depends on your color.
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on your color, and also on...
Everything, it's bias.
[SPEAKER_11]: If the police officer, or if the judge,
so there are judges now who are ruling in
[SPEAKER_11]: favor of people who present cases,
as we talked, the 50 people who can
[SPEAKER_11]: legally grow cannabis in Brazil,
medically, who have presented cases.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is changing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The federal law is that it's not a
criminal offense under 20 grams to
[SPEAKER_11]: possess.
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot grow, but as Alice says,
that's the federal law, but it depends on
[SPEAKER_11]: the interpretation.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Brazil, it has a lot of prejudice.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a tourist with money,
and you can buy off the police officer,
[SPEAKER_11]: you probably might not have a problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard for you as a tourist,
for you as an American person to get
[SPEAKER_11]: caught on the street.
[SPEAKER_11]: They won't choose you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since a bunch of it is a racial thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our drug policy is a tool to criminalize
specific people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's not new, and something that
came from America too.
[SPEAKER_11]: In America, like in the United States,
it was like that too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But definitely in Brazil, that's still
ongoing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like we are still signatories of
the war on drugs, and we're years back.
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think like a regulated industry,
kind of like in some ways, like the way
[SPEAKER_17]: medical starts first with addressing
patients, again, whose lives are
[SPEAKER_17]: basically, these people are alive because
of cannabis, that there'll be programs
[SPEAKER_17]: like that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Or do you think that there's still just
such a bias against it, just a stigma that
[SPEAKER_17]: it's drugs and all drugs are bad?
[SPEAKER_11]: It is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we are legalizing medicinal
cannabis, like with many like this,
[SPEAKER_11]: there is a bunch of big corporations that
are now, not only big corporations,
[SPEAKER_11]: but pharmaceutical industries,
they're very interested in producing
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids for this specific kind of
medication.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is going to be a big suit egg business,
because in Brazil, that is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once they realize, especially with hemp,
once they make it with hemp in Brazil,
[SPEAKER_11]: DEM, we need you guys here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need you guys here for you guys to
teach people how to make it sustainably,
[SPEAKER_11]: because in Brazil, people don't grow
sustainably.
[SPEAKER_11]: They grow like big.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I think the first step will
still be medicinal, because that's what's
[SPEAKER_11]: happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what has happened with the health
agency, and that's what's happening right
[SPEAKER_11]: now in our chamber of deputies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like I just interviewed two of our
deputies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Deputies from Brazil and Uruguay,
who are studying the Uruguayan kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: regulation, and they are going to Canada
in February to study that too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are talking here about medicinal
cannabis and growing in Brazil,
[SPEAKER_11]: and they are thinking about research,
growing, importation, exportation,
[SPEAKER_11]: but everything attached to some kind of
medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_11]: So hemp might come along, it hasn't
happened yet, the movement for industrial
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp, because I think the lobby of other
industries is very big here.
[SPEAKER_11]: But from medicinal cannabis, I think that
like the next two years, we are going to
[SPEAKER_11]: see a big movement.
[SPEAKER_15]: But did it happen in Brazil the same way?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I picture it happening this way,
which is, you know, the way cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: works, it's slow, but sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to change the way people think.
[SPEAKER_15]: And generally, the way I see it,
the way I saw it happen down in the US was
[SPEAKER_15]: they fought it and fought it and fought it
and fought it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they kind of were like,
oh no, they're finding out about the
[SPEAKER_15]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're putting all these things together.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it was like epileptic children.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was kind of like the last leg on
the table of like prohibition,
[SPEAKER_15]: being able to keep this from happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like how did it happen in Brazil?
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it sick children?
[SPEAKER_11]: That is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like all of this like individual approvals
that are called Abias corpos, that these
[SPEAKER_11]: people have to grow weed like legally in
their places, are like sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them sick children.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or like moms that have like proven that
they were given already like illegal like
[SPEAKER_11]: RSO for their kids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And still they were improving a lot and
not taking like the anti-epilepsy
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine, like medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you see that's the displacer?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the one where they're all sitting
down going, okay boys, like we're going to
[SPEAKER_15]: have to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't going away.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm certainly not going on the news and
telling everyone that that kid can't have
[SPEAKER_15]: its cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's how it starts.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they think they're going to
control it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyone that's ever grown cannabis
knows, if you give weed an inch,
[SPEAKER_15]: it'll take the whole yard.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like the beautiful thing is we do have
associations that either they are growing
[SPEAKER_11]: or they are importing the oil or they are
arranging to make it come to Brazil and
[SPEAKER_11]: they are giving this children and they are
doing better or as well as children who do
[SPEAKER_11]: have the money to import the, because
that's another form.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people who are growing and there
are people also like there are 7,000
[SPEAKER_11]: licenses for importation.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is the treatment,
just for you guys to understand how it's
[SPEAKER_11]: extremely unreachable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Monthly treatment for children cost like
2,800 reais.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is like, no, just for them to
understand, like the minimum wage months
[SPEAKER_11]: in Brazil, it's like a thousand.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like almost three times that
minimum wage.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so you guys can understand,
like it's just like very rich families
[SPEAKER_11]: that can afford that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are like stars.
[SPEAKER_11]: Baby steps take a long while.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have this increase of the
cannabis community here for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it's a worldwide movement.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are traveling to like South
America.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're experiencing like Uruguay,
Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are traveling and understanding how
the cannabis community somehow can also
[SPEAKER_11]: rise.
[SPEAKER_11]: And deputies are also starting to see the
money that they can get out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also something that this year for
sure happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like we have been to medical
conferences and things like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have also been to meetings for like
cannabis business, the billionaire markets
[SPEAKER_11]: and a bunch of like white men with
politicals starting to discuss.
[SPEAKER_11]: So studies who foresee how many billions
of dollars they can profit in the next
[SPEAKER_11]: three years if the regulation does like
this or like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't even legalized or regulated
and the green rush somehow has started.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's somehow what has been happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're already counting their money.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they're counting the money
without even having the regulation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know, once again, just like Sam
said, see cannabis is going to change the
[SPEAKER_15]: way they think.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're not going to be able to fight
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you have them like, we're not
going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not, we'll just be into the money.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, oh, still getting you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Still getting you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important that, you know,
hand in hand, we're having the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations that cannabis is good for
you, but what is good cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's as imperative as, you know,
the medicine itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be talking about what is good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that starts to have conversations
on what is good medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that helps us question big
pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we start wondering, well,
what is good cultivation?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that has us questioning big
pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're wondering, well,
what is good community?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that has us start questioning the
communities that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: only are fractured due to, you know,
misalignment and cannabis helps us align.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that these conversations need
to be, you know, uh, being pushed forward
[SPEAKER_05]: as much as the medical has been the one
that comes through the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these huge core poly corporatics,
I don't want to say corporations,
[SPEAKER_05]: poly corporate to then take that lead.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical cannabis and then make medical
illegal, like, like that continues to
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be the pattern.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important that we keep having the
conversation that this is a medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: plant, whether you're using it
recreationally or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, even in California, it's kind of a
problem with the culture of medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana was so much more compassionate,
just the way we thought about it and the
[SPEAKER_06]: things that we did in our facilities and
the way that we gave so much of our
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis for free to people that really
needed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really empowered people who are
sort of at their lowest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's kind of a pain in the butt to
get your medical card and the two tier
[SPEAKER_06]: system is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so many places have just stopped
dealing with two tiers, including our
[SPEAKER_06]: members, you know, now they're coming into
our place, even though they could go get
[SPEAKER_06]: their medical note and gain some extra
benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just too much hassle.
[SPEAKER_06]: They come in under the recreational hat
and it is a different vibe when you put
[SPEAKER_06]: that hat on, you know, or recreational or
personal use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to figure out how we still
talk about medical in our facilities and
[SPEAKER_06]: how we still keep at a driver of what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously in places like South
America, Brazil, it's still what is
[SPEAKER_06]: happening and they're still at square one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to, it would be, I'm curious,
how do we prevent medical marijuana from
[SPEAKER_06]: falling by the wayside all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say that John Conroy here in
Vancouver, BC is dealing with Canadian
[SPEAKER_13]: law, but John Conroy has put up incredible
discussions and court cases to support
[SPEAKER_13]: compassionate care.
[SPEAKER_13]: So really we just need to continue saying
the word compassionate care as a group,
[SPEAKER_13]: because in Malaysia you would never think
that it would ever be legalized because
[SPEAKER_13]: it's the death penalty.
[SPEAKER_13]: But over the last year in Malaysia,
a person brought it to the Supreme Court
[SPEAKER_13]: to be able to legalize medical marijuana
because he got in trouble for providing
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis oil to terminally ill patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just like you said, here's a country
where it's a death penalty and this person
[SPEAKER_13]: is giving compassionate care to terminally
ill patients and now they have to
[SPEAKER_13]: recognize it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're gonna go through their whole
own process, creating laws around it
[SPEAKER_13]: rather than get help from the US or
Malaysia is gonna do their own thing,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's opening the doors for Thailand.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so Thailand is creating medical
marijuana and we have good friends in
[SPEAKER_13]: Thailand who are working on regenerative
projects who would be interested in coming
[SPEAKER_13]: on Hasher if we wanna hear their story.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to hear someone in Thailand
who's doing amazing work over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: That shows how strong cannabis can change
your mind when Malaysia considers that
[SPEAKER_15]: shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: If anyone's ever flown into Malaysia and
seen the big like death sentence,
[SPEAKER_15]: like we're gonna kill you if we find drugs
on you signs, like zero tolerance,
[SPEAKER_15]: for sure we're really gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're serious, like you better not have it
to, well, maybe we'll allow a medical
[SPEAKER_15]: system.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thailand and Laos are both really pushing
the envelope for Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a really interesting collide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are again, like Indonesia,
it has death penalty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really follows under a very strict
Muslim regime for that whole entire
[SPEAKER_05]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've gone into the Aceh region and set
up in Sumatra and that's where like a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of the Indonesian flower comes from for
all of those regions and areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we set up a clinic, a free clinic
right after the tsunami.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we weren't just working with women and
children at the time because we were the
[SPEAKER_05]: first boots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we were dealing with patients of
all kind, people who hadn't seen any
[SPEAKER_05]: medical care since the tsunami had come at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was really surprised to see every
single one of the men were wearing two
[SPEAKER_05]: pocket shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, well, how much do you
smoke?
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe they would come in with
emphysema problems or some kind of lung
[SPEAKER_05]: issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say, how much do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would say, well, I smoke four of
these a day and four of these a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was their tobacco pocket and
the other one was their cannabis pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's totally normalized as soon as
you like, they don't know about government
[SPEAKER_05]: rules or government officials.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they don't care, but they know about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean anything to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're an autonomous region.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're an autonomous region.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their culture has always kept cannabis
as a part of their medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they use the language like,
this is for my fun, which would be the
[SPEAKER_05]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I use this as my medicine to get
through my day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were keeping that culture from
their great, great grandparents.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were telling me that those
varietals that they were growing were from
[SPEAKER_05]: their great, great grandparents.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that might be some unadulterated or
non-contaminated land race.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that might be some unadulterated or
non-contaminated land races in northern
[SPEAKER_13]: Sumatra still because of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a potentially good spot for
unique cultivars in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know about Ache, a flower
sconce man?
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that Ache, I will say, is spelled
A-C-E-H, Arabic, Chinese, European,
[SPEAKER_13]: and Hindustani.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the name of that lake with the
island in the middle of it over there?
Toba.
[SPEAKER_08]: Toba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Toba, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some of the first cannabis that I
saw in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I knew people who were taking Thai
seeds in the early 70s to Lake Toba and
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in Lake Toba Westerners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know people who were doing it in
Bali also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to depend on those being a pure
variety, good luck, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, jet travel has made it so that all
genetics are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they even say in the history and
historical accounts of the weed coming to
[SPEAKER_13]: the Ache originally came from India.
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: They say 300 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds that I saw were bigger than most
normal Indian seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked more like a Yunnan or a really
big Thai seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that I was dealing with in
Sumatra, because you had to sift through
[SPEAKER_05]: so many seeds, were teeny, teeny tiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure black seeds on really tall,
long, blooming, thin leaf-structured
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all that I saw when I was in
Sumatra.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to introduce you to Danny,
who works with me here at Magnolia.
[SPEAKER_06]: He got his degree at UC Berkeley,
biology, studying the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_06]: thesis about genetics and works here with
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we're sitting here thinking about
South Korea.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, where it's just like,
it's so stringent there, like Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difference is that with South
Korea, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in Thailand, Malaysia, you had a
history of cannabis and you had a history
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, for example, the left
pocket, right pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about Korea, South Korea is
like, you know, it's a stop and test
[SPEAKER_01]: state, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where, you know, if they think you're
on drugs, they can stop you and test you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, recently even hearsay of,
you know, famous people that have been in
[SPEAKER_01]: connection with vapes and things like that
have gotten into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, Korea is so stringent on
their research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of Korean buy outside companies
reaching out to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually get the research to bring back
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the issue is that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has, you know, had this stall on research
for so long that it's like, is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: correct channel that Korea should be
approaching and coming to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to even gather our data to go bring back
to theirs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it, you know, because recently,
especially in the U.S., it's less focused
[SPEAKER_01]: on the distance, more focused on
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I feel like that's an
issue because, you know, there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: break that the plant brings, but we don't
know the opposite side effects and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, is it a proper channel for
us to be taking this into Korea itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a way for Korea to start
benefiting from Malaysia or Thailand's
[SPEAKER_01]: research and kind of refocus as like an
Asian kind of collaborative work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it better for them to kind of reach
out to us and work in collaboration in
[SPEAKER_01]: that aspect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not Israel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's actually a great point,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing about Korea is that they have
had a traditional hemp industry since you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, for hundreds of years, and they
still do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow industrial hemp in Korea and
produce hemp textiles, particularly for
[SPEAKER_03]: funeral costumes and stuff that they wear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because we collected a bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I introduce you guys to our RN,
too, speaking of still having a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: focus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to poke your head over here?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an RN in house at Magnolia three
days a week, Barbara Blazer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thanks for introducing Danny and
welcome Barbara.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom, she's my mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: She started using cannabis when she was
70.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she helps the seniors.
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes out and teaches them about it and
brings them in and sits down with them and
[SPEAKER_06]: they just go through with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she does classes and courses and runs
our wellness programs also.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's amazing, Barbara.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a very important component in this,
because a lot of people who are at a
[SPEAKER_15]: certain age are kind of just like scared
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: They've they've heard all of the
propaganda.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't really want to be bothering
with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really good and empowering for
them to have someone like yourself who can
[SPEAKER_15]: walk the walk and share the education and
have have an incredible daughter like
[SPEAKER_15]: Debbie, who's been like one of the.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, crack me up like my straight mom
starts at 70.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what every time she wants to
do it on video.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get a text from my daughter who's
like 16.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went on your YouTube channel and I found
the video of grandma vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me tell you what I think I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I provide normalization for all
those people who are seniors who have been
[SPEAKER_10]: stigmatized when they thought about using
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I now say, look, here's what I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's how it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually teach classes and things like
enhancing your sexual experience with
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at her plug your ears.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't talk to mom about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently your daughter.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to hear anything about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very funny because she knows better
than to introduce me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Earlier today, I was just telling someone
that I remember when I was explaining the
[SPEAKER_10]: facts of life to Debbie.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she was nine and she just looked
stunned.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said, sometimes you tell me stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not ready to hear.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks mom.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nice meeting you all.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're definitely having Barbara back on
Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, I want everyone's mom to come on
Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is happening for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: My mother as well, she worked for the
Winnipeg police for 35 years and
[SPEAKER_15]: absolutely could not even consider using
cannabis without losing her job.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually going to see her in a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's turning 70.
[SPEAKER_15]: And just for the last maybe couple of
years, she's been using cannabis just to
[SPEAKER_15]: help her sleep, go to bed.
[SPEAKER_15]: She buys these sublingual oils from one of
the Canadian LPs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's Whistler Medical right now,
which I know they're using organic
[SPEAKER_15]: material.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know they're making water hash with that
material.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they're taking that material and
making a high terpene content sublingual
[SPEAKER_15]: oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: And my mom, she's not using it throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's still kind of a little bit afraid to
use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it makes me happy that she's less
afraid because we can laugh about it and
[SPEAKER_15]: that stigma and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's really life-threatening.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can tell you a story about my uncle,
my mother's brother, who just recently
[SPEAKER_15]: passed away of cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had asked me if I could send him some
oil for him to use to try and battle this
[SPEAKER_15]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got 60 grams of this really nice
oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I sent it out to him.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he got afraid.
[SPEAKER_15]: He thought that if he took it,
he would lose his mind and that he might
[SPEAKER_15]: lose his dignity.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he didn't want to die like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so he got afraid and he sent it back.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the end, with the medicines that he
had and the way the cancer took him,
[SPEAKER_15]: it really took him the same way that he
was worried that it would take him.
[SPEAKER_15]: I sent the oil to a friend of mine's
mother-in-law who had had some breast
[SPEAKER_15]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was in her 70s already.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just saw her post.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was her 74th birthday yesterday.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was with her grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_15]: She took the oil and got rid of the cancer
and the stigma.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I kept my uncle from taking the oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he perished.
[SPEAKER_15]: So keep doing the good work.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get rid of that stigma.
[SPEAKER_15]: And let people know that this is something
that they should not give a crap about
[SPEAKER_15]: what anyone else thinks.
[SPEAKER_15]: They should do their own research and look
into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you said is really valid for what
happened this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really think that we need to talk about
those people who are waiting
[SPEAKER_10]: to try your first one with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's going to work right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a nurse if something happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a pretty exciting time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we based the program, or we learned it
from our colleagues in Israel,
[SPEAKER_06]: going back there where the seniors like
to, where you get, maybe you get the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the cannabis at the pharmacy,
but you bring it to the community center
[SPEAKER_06]: and you try it with your community for the
first time with a peer counselor sitting
[SPEAKER_06]: with you, helping you learn how to use it
and ingest it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're there in case you get afraid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the end of life
conversation in cannabis use is absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: imperative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that brings, you know, cannabis back
to medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: On my mother's death bed, I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I midwifed her through her death.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was because cannabis, she was
having a very difficult time.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said she was going through,
you know, all of the thoughts of her life
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was bringing her tremendous pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, Hey, let's try out the
volcano.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my son got on the bed, you know,
just fully immersed her in, in vapors from
[SPEAKER_05]: the old school volcano.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything changed her whole, everything
changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: She went from reviewing her whole life and
maybe some of the bad times in her life to
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that was positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: In her life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only was she afraid to die,
but after the cannabis, she was actually
[SPEAKER_05]: excited to make the crossover.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, this is somebody who,
you know, was incredibly conservative and
[SPEAKER_05]: it wasn't until maybe the last eight years
of her life that I started to introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis to her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was taking more cannabis than I
could ever take in a whole week in one
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like she, we were calling her the cannabis
queen at the end, like girlfriend was like
[SPEAKER_05]: fully immersed with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in her last eight years of life,
she changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: She became a completely different person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of what happened on the bed
and her last, you know, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: moments of life, the last thing that she
said to me, and it was important.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like folly, but it was so
important to her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She drew me close and she said,
Kelly, in my next life, I'm going to smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was like telling me I've come
from here and now I'm going to there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a really, it was, it was
something incredibly powerful and it makes
[SPEAKER_05]: me know that I'm on the right path in my
life to continue to share these stories
[SPEAKER_05]: and share good flowers and also share
healthy flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only, you know, medicine, uh,
that's good, but medicine that's good for
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even on her death, you know,
getting close to her death, she was like,
[SPEAKER_13]: I recognize I'm going to die now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it's just, how do you die?
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you say, oh my gosh, you know,
I'm ready and, and I know this is
[SPEAKER_13]: happening and it's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the cannabis just kind of
soothed her to the point where she didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it just, it happens like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the most beautiful, you know,
passing that anyone could, could ever
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's, it's just like,
here we are again, cannabis even creates a
[SPEAKER_05]: catalyst for the living to understand true
dying and, and what it can be and what
[SPEAKER_05]: that crossover is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the most valuable points of our life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring cannabis into births.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used cannabis multiple times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's part of my pregnancy T
CBD that I give women, women that are
[SPEAKER_05]: having a really hard time, you know,
making that transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they've been sexually used.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many women today that I deal with,
you know, they're saying like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, one in four have not been
sexually abused now in our culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you go through that abuse when you have
to have a child and cannabis creates this
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful avenue to be able to deal with
that, for women to deal with their,
[SPEAKER_05]: their fears.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is, it's true compassion and it
allows you to realize, Oh, I can go ahead
[SPEAKER_05]: and make this with ease on my own terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I feel like that's like,
you know, life and death it's hidden from
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and cannabis gives us really good
language to be able to help us as a
[SPEAKER_05]: culture, unveil these, these mysteries.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's beautiful when you say that about
women and also family, what has been
[SPEAKER_11]: happening with my family here in Brazil,
it is very crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you guys understand when I'm in
Brazil, I live with my mom and my grandma.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just women.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very powerful.
[SPEAKER_11]: My, my grandma's name is Maria,
which is like marijuana somehow too.
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom's name is Huchi Maria and my name
is Alice Maria.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we all have the Maria under our
names.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's crazy because starting as an
activist, I feel like we have to be an
[SPEAKER_11]: activist in our places too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it starts from the inside to the
outside.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I broke through the stigma with my mom
and my grandma about cannabis in the past,
[SPEAKER_11]: like, I don't know, maybe six to eight
years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now my mom dabbed sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: She loved the puff call.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like she dabbed the cookies and cream like
Marcus the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she loved it.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was like, Oh, this tastes good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my grandma has been actually taking
like take like the oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I figured out that actually only the
CBD does not work for her because she has
[SPEAKER_11]: a bit of depression.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it has to like the THC helped her out a
lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like one year ago was the first time
that I started like giving this to her.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw in her eyes, like and in her
movements and in her appetite and her
[SPEAKER_11]: happiness, like how much it changed her in
many ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: She became less grumpy.
[SPEAKER_11]: My grandma is grumpy, grumpy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maria knows it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like it changed her a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, here in Brazil,
since we can't buy it and it's not an easy
[SPEAKER_11]: access.
[SPEAKER_11]: This year she stayed a few months without
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I have a whole setup for her.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I brought Candani, I brought from
California a bunch for my grandma and my
[SPEAKER_11]: mom, but everyone's being medicated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it was very, it was very beautiful to
see how like all these women like breaking
[SPEAKER_11]: the stigma, like through family.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absolutely beautiful and sorry to
interrupt, but it's what it really is,
[SPEAKER_15]: is it's the answer I'm giving everyone
from now on when they tell me how should I
[SPEAKER_15]: get started in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling them from now on, learn
everything you can go deep dive,
[SPEAKER_15]: have a personal intimate relationship with
it, and then turn your parents on and your
[SPEAKER_15]: grandparents.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once you've turned your parents and your
grandparents on, you are now ready for the
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis industry because when you go out
and you tell people how you got into it
[SPEAKER_15]: and that's your story, you're going to be
listened to because the people who have
[SPEAKER_15]: those stories to me are the most valid
stories.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate you guys turning on your,
your grandma and your mom.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's pretty hardcore stepping it up
to my mom dabs sometimes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Holy Moses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus, when you say get people started in
the cannabis industry, what do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's something I question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't even go into what it means
because it means something different to
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what it means to me is they want to
come to the cannabis party.
[SPEAKER_15]: They just want to come to the cannabis
party.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are looking at it like I'm
trapped in this job that keeps me from
[SPEAKER_15]: doing anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a slave and they see people living
this cannabis life and they're like,
[SPEAKER_15]: is there a place for me?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a way that I can do this and do
what you guys are doing?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a way for this?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a way for this to somehow
eventually allow me?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's more attached.
[SPEAKER_15]: The people that I listen to any way that
I, when I read the emails and I get a lot
[SPEAKER_15]: of emails, I can feel this passion in,
in like a spark in their, in their email
[SPEAKER_15]: or sometimes they'll send an actual
letter.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't know exactly what it means,
but to me, I'm, I'm telling people from
[SPEAKER_15]: now on how you should get started with
cannabis is by having your own
[SPEAKER_15]: relationship with it, learning as much as
you can, and then turning on your parents
[SPEAKER_15]: and your grandparents.
[SPEAKER_06]: We definitely, before we opened our first
consumption lounge at Berkeley patients
[SPEAKER_06]: group, we did two things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We visited Vancouver and we looked at what
Hillary Black was doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the whole crew was doing there
down there in downtown Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we liked what Hillary did because she
had a store in one storefront and a
[SPEAKER_06]: medical center, like a health center.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were right next door and they
were, they worked together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really liked that model.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we went to the Netherlands,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: To check out the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like, we got a hybrid of those two
models.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you make a totally cool place that
you can hang out and smoke weed and has a
[SPEAKER_06]: vibe of compassion attached to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we started, you know,
20 years ago in 1999 with Berkeley
[SPEAKER_06]: patients group and still trying to do it
here at Magnolia.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you it's a workout these days to
try and still stay tuned to that culture
[SPEAKER_08]: and that transformation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's so true because I told the
story earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if you heard it, but yeah,
we, you, I met you like 20 plus years ago
[SPEAKER_15]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was, I'm still, I'm still on the
same street, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm two houses over from the house
that I met you at.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's beautiful there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who were you with?
[SPEAKER_14]: You came with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came up there a couple of different
times.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you were with a woman.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't remember what her name was.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super tall.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she wasn't that super tall.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very smart.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe, maybe it was Samma UC Berkeley
student.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also just a science person.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that sounds more familiar.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that kind of leads me into a
introducing Brian, uh, who, who has spoken
[SPEAKER_15]: a few times, but I haven't even introduced
him.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's actually from a company called D
Nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, I've been working close with him
as well as Etienne.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I kind of switched to this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it might be a little bit of a
different topic, but when Debbie said
[SPEAKER_15]: science and Berkeley and, you know,
thinkers and super smart, I was like,
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well let's bring in Brian and talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause what Brian's kind of been,
Oh, super smart Brian.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, well you've been focusing
and nerding out on the surfaces that we
[SPEAKER_15]: take our dabs off of and the types of,
you know, composite, these different
[SPEAKER_15]: silicon carbides and these different
courses with the different spinning balls.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've just been going into it and
kind of opening that discussion a little
[SPEAKER_15]: deeper than most.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know hash churches is going to end
here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought we could just end it with a
conversation of, you know, how different,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, what are you doing these days
with, with the different dab surface areas
[SPEAKER_15]: and the different, you know, I noticed
you're doing all these different,
[SPEAKER_15]: um, methodologies of getting the resin to
spin around the courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk about new stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to, do you want to do a quick
intro there?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is years of my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do a quick, do a quick little intro and
try to fix your mic.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's crackling a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a little bit better?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, kind of let's just go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you guys can hear me,
uh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, short version is when we started our
work, titanium and quartz were pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the discourse was pretty much the
titanium guys saying fuck quartz and vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no real science, no particular reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even worse, uh, no one was able to
interpret what data there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just decided to look at all
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, initially we'd set it, we'd settled on
silicon carbide for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk at length on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later we ended up settling on
Sapphire, which, uh, as you 've seen has
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing flavor properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of new things to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The that's optical grade Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parts are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, where we are with it now,
we spent some years working in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cannabis distillation, uh,
essential oil extraction, uh, distilling
[SPEAKER_00]: by gradient, putting everything back
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having really spent time studying up
close on, on a molecular level,
[SPEAKER_00]: how cannabis comes apart, goes back
together, bringing that back to related to
[SPEAKER_00]: dish hardware, how, how oil moves across
the surface with the surface adhesion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface architecture, the thermal
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of refining what we call the
flavor equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does all of this relate to,
to, to our flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately flavor is preservation of
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get them out intact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get them out in the same narrow
window of time intact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, silicon carbide is amazing for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something, something about
Sapphire, we're actually homing in on that
[SPEAKER_00]: to math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, actually the, the big thing that we're
doing right now is we're trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what relevant safety tests for
materials are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got in some off gas tests for a
new kind of quartz and we've sent out some
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon carbide because what are the
safety tests available for the nails?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of been a he said,
she said what we're smoking on is safe all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way back to aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember smoking on brass pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember smoking on an aluminum bowl and
a plastic bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke can?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke can, aluminum foil, apple,
bamboo thermos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A papaya leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a papaya leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had one handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're hollow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mangle, you know, like the mango seed
inside the mango seed if you dry it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry it and drill it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Good old fashioned apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been smoking off all these random
things and today I'm finding myself asking
[SPEAKER_00]: the question is thermo, is thermo
gravimetric analysis a relevant test for
[SPEAKER_00]: materials?
[SPEAKER_15]: I asked myself the very same thing this
morning, actually, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the short version, it's, it's fancy
speak for get it really hot and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there was any glass at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a good way to tell if
anything is actually coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really, really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, let me break this down.
[SPEAKER_17]: So TGA thermo gravimetric analysis is a
very sensitive hand that basically ramps
[SPEAKER_17]: up the temperature.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then what you do is the pan is
basically measuring the weight loss as a
[SPEAKER_17]: function of temperature, which is a
function of time, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: So if your temperature ramp ramps up like,
I don't know, like 10 degrees a minute,
[SPEAKER_17]: you'll see basically the temperature start
to rise, start to rise, start to rise.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if some, sort of physical
transformation happens to like a solid,
[SPEAKER_17]: then it turns into a liquid and ultimately
a liquid vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_17]: You would see this as a loss in mass over
a period of time because you're starting
[SPEAKER_17]: sort of with, you know, a full gram on
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the time you've gotten to like 60
or 70 degrees, perhaps like a quarter of
[SPEAKER_17]: it has been vaporized because there's
terpenes in there and you're going to see
[SPEAKER_17]: that in basically a loss in mass.
[SPEAKER_17]: So TGA or thermo gravimetric analysis is
just a measure of weight loss as a
[SPEAKER_17]: function of temperature done on a very
sophisticated instrument that costs about
[SPEAKER_17]: $200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you say conducting that kind of
a test on our nail materials, the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually vaporizing off 1000 C TGA,
would you say that's a relevant test for
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to determine material safety?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, well, there's two things.
[SPEAKER_17]: So in a TGA, TGA experiment, you're
constantly changing the temperature.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're not, you could, I guess you can
take the temperature to a particular
[SPEAKER_17]: temperature and then hold it there to see
what it's like.
[SPEAKER_17]: Typically what you're doing is you're just
looking at the thermal properties of
[SPEAKER_17]: something as it's heated up and you're
basically just looking at the loss in
[SPEAKER_17]: mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're looking for is get it up,
hold it there and 100% weight the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it's anything other than that,
the nail shedding something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really even matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want zero.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so the thermo gravimetric analysis may
not give you the result you're looking for
[SPEAKER_17]: because you're going to pass through that,
that number, unless you hold it at a
[SPEAKER_17]: particular, a particular temperature.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I think the, the example where you
want to look at the impact of the nail
[SPEAKER_17]: surface on the vapor profile is something
called a headspace GC measurement,
[SPEAKER_17]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: So you want to be able to put the nail
material inside a vessel that's got,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the stuff vaporized in it to now
where you're measuring the amount and the
[SPEAKER_17]: constituents of what's in the vapor phase
above the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about, you're talking
about vaporizing oil off the nail and then
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzing the vapor to see if it's
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm not talking about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just saying that you can look at the
impact of a nail surface in a headspace GC
[SPEAKER_17]: measurement a little bit more in detail
than you can say just in the TGA
[SPEAKER_17]: experiment in and of itself, which is just
going to give you one number, one number
[SPEAKER_17]: alone, which is weight loss.
[SPEAKER_17]: Weight loss is a function of time,
which is again, can be translated to
[SPEAKER_17]: weight loss as a function of temperature.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you put in your, your temperature
program file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our purposes, we're looking for
thousand degrees Celsius zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing being lost at 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing being lost at 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing being lost all the way up
to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an analytical chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the best thing I could think
of to just go for a blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this nail going to release anything at
temperature?
[SPEAKER_15]: And see what my interest is, is in knowing
is what is happening in how are these
[SPEAKER_15]: surfaces different?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I, you know, you've sent them all
to me in the way of, well, I mean in,
[SPEAKER_15]: in generally in regards to when I have
them all at the exact same temperature and
[SPEAKER_15]: I drop a dab of the same resin,
I noticed that the terpenes are either
[SPEAKER_15]: destroyed or preserved differently from
the different surfaces.
[SPEAKER_15]: And for me, I honed in on like a low temp
dab off of Sapphire as being one of the
[SPEAKER_15]: most preserved you know, like it,
it tastes like what I want it to taste
[SPEAKER_15]: like.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I didn't even realize how different it
tasted off of a different surface at the
[SPEAKER_15]: same temperature.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I want to understand.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On using quartz as an example,
quartz, quartz is an extremely poor
[SPEAKER_00]: conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start putting oil into it and
it's going to start phase changing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a puddle and you're going to
get vapor coming off under the puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not displacing that fluid,
if you don't have any adhesion going on as
[SPEAKER_00]: that that vapor is created, it's going to
spend a lot of extra time in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher temperature, which is going to
start degrading the compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to automatically lose a lot
of your flavor because these things with
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 Celsius boiling points, 50 Celsius
boiling points are cooking, degrading and
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down your, your more,
your most volatile flavors are just the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals are gone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Brian, Kelly had a good idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's try you without your headphones or
your mic.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we do, or is that the only mic you
have?
[SPEAKER_15]: Does your computer have a mic?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still pretty crackly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't mind putting up with it myself,
but I thought Kelly's idea was good and I
[SPEAKER_15]: thought it could just fix that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems like it's, I've had people before
where they had to like play with the
[SPEAKER_15]: little, the little, you know, the Jack
that goes in for the headphones and then
[SPEAKER_15]: it's gone away.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, I'm still willing to listen,
man.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was better with headphones.
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, okay, Jay Henry's not really,
but we've disabled all of our microphones
[SPEAKER_00]: in the house as best we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went through and I specially tried
to set something up for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do better next time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, with the work that we,
me and Maria do, we do a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_11]: education into some stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like wondering this last couple
of days to write about like different
[SPEAKER_11]: surfaces to dad, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we have to be a bit more like,
we have to talk a bit about my titanium
[SPEAKER_11]: and quartz and the differences in glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was wondering if you have any
material that you could send to us,
[SPEAKER_11]: like into information about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there is any kind of like,
I don't know if that's the word in English
[SPEAKER_11]: for that, but like the weathering of the
materials.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how much do you use?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what I see a lot is like people
dabbing from quartz and then the quartz
[SPEAKER_11]: starts to like, it just doesn't stay the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be something.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it weathered out with the heat,
with the temperature?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it releases like toxic things for us
in a way?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, some of that we're trying to
answer more specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short version with quartz is that it's
oxidizing and breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: At higher temperatures, it's more that the
raw quartz is accepting extra oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that bad unless you're
actually hitting it, rubbing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to do a lot of education
stuff, let's make sure we can contact
[SPEAKER_00]: after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will just make sure all your
questions are answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can't answer your question,
I'll point you in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, when we get a solid mic for you too,
I want to do like a full show,
[SPEAKER_15]: whether it's even a hash church or just
you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And me and a couple other people who are
interested in talking about it because
[SPEAKER_15]: it's another.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll go to the store now.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a question here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you are you working with the way that
temperature is heating material at the
[SPEAKER_16]: same time as well as the type of surfaces
that it's heating?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: For instance, like, you know, right now,
you know, a typical battery zero to 60,
[SPEAKER_16]: right?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's typically not how we take breaths or
inhale.
[SPEAKER_16]: Material, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, we're not just like zero to 60 with
a hit.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's it's a slow pull.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then maybe we're pulling a little
harder at the end or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, how does that affect the surface
area and the material and all of that,
[SPEAKER_16]: that trifecta kind of working together?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things that I learned in
distilling is that if you have stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want, your tar, your heavy
resin, whatever degradation compounds are
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted that would be left behind,
the energy you need to vaporize is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the energy you need to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things we're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does how does this all fit together to
getting everything out of your oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the simple things is just
raising your temperature a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the exact opposite of a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature curve is on its way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either reheating toward the end or
increasing your temperature on some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a tap control device or accept that
there's loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, to answer your question,
it's it's a it's a non homogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time, pressure, temperature, variations
within them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these end up creating an equation
that is so highly variable, has so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different results and outcomes based on
what people are trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In trying to answer even like what's
better, you have to do an intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better now?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we backtrack that to what kind of
nail, what kind of oil and what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: technique and hardware do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's no there's no answer to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is going to keep evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just discussion.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the exciting stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do a lot of talking to people about
what do you dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to backtrack that to what
kind of hardware can we make that even if
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have a specific construction set,
this hardware gives you the option to
[SPEAKER_00]: augment your skill set to get more of what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and it shows in the in the in the
equipment because tons of people send me
[SPEAKER_15]: stuff and I, you know, I've got the puking
beagle, you know, flared banger in there
[SPEAKER_15]: right now with the two silicon carbide
spheres.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a great it's my favorite banger.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also flared at the at the top.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got this little piece of quartz,
but they've they've pushed it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the oil pushes out and then really
flares beautifully around in here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was inspired by the thin film
evaporators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is actually spinning around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pneumatic actuated thin film
evaporator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bead leaves a semi-spherical thin film
of residue on the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly efficient.
[SPEAKER_15]: You sent me even some other crazy more
like a thin film like experimental.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know where it was,
but it was like a heater that went around
[SPEAKER_15]: like didn't you send me that one too?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you drop the hit and it was a big
glass like That's the falling film
[SPEAKER_15]: inspired by the falling film, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's not something we've been
promoting, but that one is specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: designed for people with pulmonary issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gravity assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set the lowest possible
temperature and just sit it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are thinking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think about a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything translates to a product,
but you have to think about 100 things to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up 10 products and 10 products to
have one good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you guys reminded me of my own
company.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you weren't the first electric
nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: You took a lot of guff, but you pushed
through it and continued to be innovators,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I feel like bubble bags did the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we weren't the first bag
company, but we certainly innovated,
[SPEAKER_15]: changed the game, and brought it to a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thread in the chain, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a different specialty and skill set
than most of the people here, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: irrelevant without all of you and
everybody that came before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you know, I'm trying to focus on
my specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we keep describing our work
was we're trying to do what's not been
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's done at somebody else's job,
and if it's not been done, then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone has to.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to get some bubble bags over to the
girls in green, actually.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, I made that promise,
and then you guys never hit me up for
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got to reach out.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got to reach out and get you guys
bubbling in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great to be able to give bubble bags
away.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll say it's one of the greatest things
ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've given a lot of bubble bags away over
the years, and what a nice gift.
[SPEAKER_15]: The gift of making hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: It works for me too, because then
generally I'll be like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to like the middle of nowhere
soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I gave some guy some bubble bags
that lives in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have to give that guy a call.
[SPEAKER_08]: You gave me a set.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, no shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You gave me a set.
[SPEAKER_16]: You gave me a set, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_16]: We got some- Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good to give.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good to give.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know who really taught me the gift of
giving?
[SPEAKER_15]: Fish.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fish taught me the gift of giving.
[SPEAKER_15]: I miracle'd 16 of my virgin fish friends
into a fish show in like 96.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like, I never seen such enjoyment
and joy on someone's face.
[SPEAKER_15]: I realized, wow, giving is incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to be a giver.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_15]: Be generous.
[SPEAKER_15]: Give.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it's your time, your energy,
or something else, don't be afraid to
[SPEAKER_15]: give.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_15]: 11.47.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got another 15 minutes to shoot the
shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have maybe a quick thing to retouch on
with South Korea.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Korean natural farming is playing
such a big role in cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_13]: these days.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you combine Korean natural farming with
permaculture and with biodynamics and with
[SPEAKER_13]: everything, you can create a really
dynamic farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Korea also has an incredible amount of
information with medicinal mushrooms
[SPEAKER_13]: historically.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of information that we in
the English speaking world can't access
[SPEAKER_13]: that we want to access through medicinal
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it behooves South Korea to
hold on to its information any more than
[SPEAKER_13]: it behooves the United States or any other
country to hold on to its information.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's opening the information that
makes us all better.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that that's what we've been
talking about a lot here today.
[SPEAKER_13]: The non-compete aspect of feeling better
on earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have created some laws that make
sense in North America, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_13]: the US or in Canada, I think that it would
make sense for South Korea to say,
[SPEAKER_13]: hey, this has made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been a lot of things that don't
make sense out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: As we've recognized, our legalization has
a lot of flaws.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that with countries that are new
and they're coming on, it would be really
[SPEAKER_13]: smart for them to enact the things that
are working within each system and to
[SPEAKER_13]: allow open exchange back and forth because
the ultimate reason for a country to take
[SPEAKER_13]: on legalization would be for health and
well-being.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, we're recognizing that health and
well-being isn't just a product,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's the way it's made.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cultivation is the health and well-being
of the earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're using these cultivation practices to
heal the earth, and then we want those
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivation practices to go and heal our
humans through products.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's come together with South Korea and
be the most educated group of people ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Russia could play an amazing
thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Japan, China, there's so much information
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we have to say is free up the
information for the betterment of
[SPEAKER_13]: humanity.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we learned that as... Oh,
go ahead, Debbie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be fun to maybe get some of the
greenhouse strain hunter guys on at some
[SPEAKER_06]: point to tell us what's happening in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Photos coming across, they're really
trying to rebuild that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's long been a ganja based society.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a lot of work there.
[SPEAKER_15]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: We could probably get... There's a few
good family members.
[SPEAKER_13]: Potent Ponucks is in Zimbabwe right now
and working with some people that are
[SPEAKER_13]: doing beautiful work with track and trace.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've worked within the cacao industry,
trying to support small farmers through
[SPEAKER_13]: cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those cooperatives give them collective
bargaining, which allow them to set prices
[SPEAKER_13]: rather than the market setting prices
where the farmer never sees a benefit from
[SPEAKER_13]: a rise or a lower in price.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cooperatives allow farmers to exist
better.
[SPEAKER_13]: Track and trace programs that have been
placed on the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_13]: can be a really good thing and we can
learn that through coffee and cacao in
[SPEAKER_13]: Africa is a huge frontier of
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some amazing people in South
Africa doing work.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be interesting to see how
that comes up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously THCV and a lot of unique
cannabinoids are coming out of places like
[SPEAKER_13]: Malawi, also Nigeria, also Swaziland in
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, freeing it up, is for the
betterment of humanity.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's why I always shared clones,
always.
[SPEAKER_15]: People will be like, oh, you're not
supposed to share that one.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because every time someone loses all their
genetics because they're an idiot and
[SPEAKER_15]: don't give them away or share because
they're an idiot, just to reiterate that
[SPEAKER_15]: one more time.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all crying and bummed out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you know what the first thing they
do?
[SPEAKER_15]: If they taxed someone hard and sold them a
clone for big money and said, don't give
[SPEAKER_15]: it away to anyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: They say, oh, do you think I could get
that clone back that I told you not to
[SPEAKER_15]: give to anyone and I charged you $5,000
for?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm such an idiot.
[SPEAKER_15]: Third time I lost it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Protect your genetics.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a big company.
[SPEAKER_15]: You spent millions of dollars on breeding.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one thing, but like you just have a
great cultivar that you barely had
[SPEAKER_15]: anything to do with other than acquiring
it and you're holding onto it with greed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Shame on you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Shame, shame, shame.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to save it, give it away.
[SPEAKER_15]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually a good thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's funny because I had a
conversation with a local guy here in
[SPEAKER_15]: Vancouver who was pissed that I gave the
Congo away to everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was like, you know, you got to,
you got to like filter and figure out who
[SPEAKER_15]: deserves this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, everyone deserves it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's like, well, that's just not true.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'm like, well, how do you know
if say someone that you think doesn't
[SPEAKER_15]: deserve it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Ends up with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But really the only reason they ended up
with it was to give it to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_15]: people who did deserve it that you didn't
have access to.
[SPEAKER_15]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_15]: I stumped him on that one.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was kind of like, Oh, but just give
your gift, give the cultivars away.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're in a position that you can,
you know, if they're not like the,
[SPEAKER_15]: your entire business or whatnot,
if you can and you have a great,
[SPEAKER_15]: great cultivar, it's good to share it more
so in an envious photo shot on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_15]: but also by giving it away.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've given a lot of the clones away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcus or Johnny, can you tell us about
your $180 gram of rosin?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I bet you Johnny's been dying to tell
us about the $180 gram of rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_15]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I muted you a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you're unmuted.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you unmuted?
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I unmuted?
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I hear you perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you guys?
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_15]: My fellow Huff Wednesday host.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, that was a beautiful Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was so and the thing what was so funny
is, is the message in the morning,
[SPEAKER_12]: what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_12]: We should do something like laugh out
loud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't we try and find some legal hash
and then we'll go buy it on the black
[SPEAKER_12]: market.
[SPEAKER_12]: We named a couple of our friends are like,
don't fucking worry, they're going on
[SPEAKER_12]: camera.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're like, we got to figure something
out.
[SPEAKER_12]: He goes, well, make some calls,
see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I called down to a couple places in
Vancouver and like, yeah, no, no,
[SPEAKER_12]: we don't have that at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got we got nothing.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of some gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I call my friend, Rohan, and he's
working for verbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, dude, he got me got me hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, dude, I just picked up some
rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what was a good friend of mine,
I've known the guy for 20 years,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're going to Green Cross, sharing is
caring.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we still have different strains for
different pains and really giving back.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, you have to try this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So of course, I call Mark and he's like,
I'm 51 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was what came out of his mouth.
[SPEAKER_12]: 51 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, I'm 47 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we basically ran like kids to go and
get this, you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, I do, of course, have it like
right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been saving it to let certain
people try it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we got there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what, opened it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess you guys, if you haven't seen
Puff Wednesdays, you have to watch it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I went home and tested the water
activity on it right away.
[SPEAKER_12]: A.W.
[SPEAKER_12]: It said the 55 sweet.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always say 55 fresh.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just the terpenes were there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I get a good flavor.
[SPEAKER_12]: We both got really nice and high from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did a dab with it just right down the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I jumped in, I pulled it out to do a
little dab with it and get that flavor.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's uplifting.
It's.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I see on the black market,
does it compare?
[SPEAKER_12]: I know people in Congress, you were
looking for that killer hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Time out, time out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trying to find that on the black market
wouldn't be as easy as you think,
[SPEAKER_15]: because it was organic hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hung dry, organically grown, washed,
pressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like I'm going to say it's a good
price.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: $180 is not a terrible price.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the worst price ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they have to do, Marcus,
to make a good price?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you right
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me tell you what they need to do right
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_15]: So these guys at Berb, they had some
really nice flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to buy it from these legal
grows.
[SPEAKER_15]: But some of them, like a percentage,
I don't know, like maybe 25 percent that I
[SPEAKER_15]: was looking at was like, holy shit,
that's nicer than I thought they were
[SPEAKER_15]: going to have.
[SPEAKER_15]: They had it in custom jars, little glass
triangular jars that were sealed,
[SPEAKER_15]: but had a down stem coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a down stem coming out of them with a
cork in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you could take the cork out and you
could smell all these different varieties.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust me, any cannabis user would have
walked into their front area and been
[SPEAKER_15]: like, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were like, we don't do the iPad
thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: We want you to see the bud, look at the
bud.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I said, well, are you able to like,
what do you do?
[SPEAKER_15]: Just sell the bud at a discount once it's
been deterred?
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: The regulations, we have to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, no, listen, we have to mix it
with bleach and kitty litter, grind it and
[SPEAKER_15]: throw it in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_15]: And because they're of this sort of
connoisseur nature and they're not going
[SPEAKER_15]: for that iPad photo thing, they want you
to see it and smell it and sort of,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, have that experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: It costs them an enormous amount of money
just to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's all sorts of stupid regulations
set up where it screws these shops in a
[SPEAKER_15]: way that sort of locks them into basically
this is it for now or nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can do this or you just have
nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so of course, as we've been sort of,
you know, jamming our foot in the door of
[SPEAKER_15]: ending prohibition in Canada, because at
first it was like a little pinky toe that
[SPEAKER_15]: held the door open.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I'd say we're probably around the
knee.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to get that elbow around the
door and have it crack wide open because
[SPEAKER_15]: we're still dealing with an enormous
amount of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_15]: And no one is really blaming the right
people.
[SPEAKER_15]: The division in the community is the
people who went to start legal stores or
[SPEAKER_15]: sellouts and that the activists who did
not have the access to getting a licensing
[SPEAKER_15]: or whatnot are still like the real deal.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the meantime, the government who
makes all the rules and is creating the
[SPEAKER_15]: division over here is kind of the more
responsible of the three for creating a
[SPEAKER_15]: system that if we understand in Canada,
our system was created in part by us
[SPEAKER_15]: telling them, no, we need this,
this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm saying, oh, well, we'll give you
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then us coming back and saying,
no, sorry, we're going to need this,
[SPEAKER_15]: this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in our Charter of Rights.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've taken them to court.
[SPEAKER_15]: These companies that were selling legal
herbs sort of lobbied at one point that,
[SPEAKER_15]: hey, maybe Canada doesn't need a grow
license thing, a medical license anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we could just supply them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Went against our charters and we won in
court thanks to John Conroy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and some other great lawyers,
you know, fighting this right fight,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's so slow.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just one little point at a time.
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line is I'm still happy that
there's, there's a gram available.
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone has 180 bucks, they can go and
try it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't buy it personally, but I went
with John.
[SPEAKER_15]: I bought a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was super happy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like, you know, don't fight
against access that already exists.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just create new and better.
[SPEAKER_15]: Better access.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need to, you know, tear the
system apart.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are, there are, there are lawmakers
still going, you know, around communities
[SPEAKER_13]: that are, are trying to, you know,
affect the law here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are, and, and that there's more
of us and we have the charter on our side.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's, and Canada actually seems to
respect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want a cheaper price,
you think they need to grow a larger
[SPEAKER_03]: volume of the same high quality.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Giving licensing, allowing more craft
growers, allowing more people to be a part
[SPEAKER_15]: of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Allow opening up the pool, letting people
process, making it more available,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, you know, loosen up that control
over it can only be sold here,
[SPEAKER_15]: here and here and open it up in a more,
in a way that's more like, okay,
[SPEAKER_15]: well, if you can, you know, if you have
the business savvy and you have the
[SPEAKER_15]: investment and you have the ability,
then you should be able to do this instead
[SPEAKER_15]: of everyone being kept out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have no objection to taxes or
regulations to protect the consumer,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that is common sense to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I just can't understand the $180
a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand that might be
necessary at this moment for them to make
[SPEAKER_03]: a profit because of the particular
structured way they're selling it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you and I both know that $180 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, either one of us could produce it
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, beyond cheaper.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is for the recreational market in
Canada, not the medical market by any
[SPEAKER_15]: means.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now how everyone's in, in a big uproar in
the meantime, if you were going to,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you were to go to the black market to
get such quality, you would maybe,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you were really in the know,
get a $50 price tag, uh, but more likely
[SPEAKER_15]: it would be 80 to a hundred dollar price
tag, which is even though it's half price
[SPEAKER_15]: just as absolutely ridiculous because
honestly those companies and how much they
[SPEAKER_15]: have to pay for overhead and taxes and
like the regulations and how they're,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's all set up to screw them.
[SPEAKER_15]: That extra hundred dollars is for sure
burnt in that plus more out of the second
[SPEAKER_15]: hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_15]: The black market people are probably
making a way larger profit margin because
[SPEAKER_15]: their lack of, of, of, of cost,
their burn rate is way lower than some of
[SPEAKER_15]: these hundred million dollar LP.
[SPEAKER_15]: These that have, you know, put themselves
public on the stock market and done all
[SPEAKER_15]: these things.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm sort of upset with both of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the most ridiculous 80 is still not
affordable.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our story is in Brazil where the only the
wealthy people can participate,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and in that way it's similar in
different parts of the world, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: where they've created the system that is
just so overblown that it becomes a,
[SPEAKER_13]: a civil disobedience just to keep going
the other direction.
[SPEAKER_13]: If, if legalization was supposed to get
rid of the black market, that isn't
[SPEAKER_13]: working yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it was supposed to create access to
people, that's not working yet in Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's where compassionate care
is allowing that to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can, you know, make it really,
you know, heady and good products still
[SPEAKER_13]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just looking up expensive wines and
there's plenty in the $7,000 range for a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curious to see where we go with this
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time you bought a $700
bottle of wine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a 7,000 and never, and I probably
never will.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone must be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's obviously out there, Marcus,
but you know, people do all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have friends who were so many
layers and they told me that the guys
[SPEAKER_03]: would come in and ask, what is the most
expensive wine you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because value.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, they written in a very
expensive restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't paying for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is in the lower tier,
not in the five and 10, not in the five
[SPEAKER_00]: and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a very expensive stuff,
but humans are capable of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, there is a justifiable level of
effort that can go in from, from soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, to genetics, to care,
to produce some really, really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know anybody that's really
targeting a $500 gram, but conceptually I
[SPEAKER_00]: can, I can justify it, but it would have
to be something really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to see that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you can't use to fund
something better than producing a luxury
[SPEAKER_00]: good for rich people, but you know,
there's going to, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at, look at the food market,
look at the liquor market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that just ultra high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it is justified in terms of
the effort that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I probably would have dropped five hundo
on some of Sam's dry sift when I first met
[SPEAKER_15]: him.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he would never sell it in a
million years, but had, if he would have,
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have been like, look, 500 seems
like a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for the historical context of like,
oh, so you've not only grown these plants,
[SPEAKER_15]: you're actually bred them with seeds you
collected in hash producing countries that
[SPEAKER_15]: you lived in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like ding, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historical context is one of the biggest
reasons things get a high price tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Thomas Jefferson made it, it's going to
be worth a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say in California
right now, there's a proposal coming from
[SPEAKER_06]: some big part of the government saying
that we should consider taxing cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: more like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't even know that there was a
higher excise tax on things like bourbon
[SPEAKER_06]: or whiskey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they actually tax alcohol on potency.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the state of California now is
considering a taxation policy that changes
[SPEAKER_06]: taxation and makes it based on potency
rather than just the flat rate they have
[SPEAKER_06]: right now for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That just sounds so crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the table right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not proud of the $180 gram of rosin
hash rosin here in the Canadian legal
[SPEAKER_15]: market, but just keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, I'm hoping that our company can
make enough hash that the price can only
[SPEAKER_15]: go one way.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen $150 half grams in California,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_16]: Were they any good?
[SPEAKER_16]: They were phenomenal, but to Sam's point,
it doesn't need to be that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It just is that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supply and demand.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we were at the Emerald Cup and
before that was the Ego Clash,
[SPEAKER_13]: which was, you know, a hash cup at the
third James House.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good name.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was named that way for a
reason, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: The hash that was there is absolutely
insane.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not just like four or five hash
makers, it's barn.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's filled with hash makers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the level of quality there is
absolutely mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were just talking with James at
Product Earth in the UK, who has an
[SPEAKER_13]: amazing conference going up that we're
going to.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was saying when Skittles got first
created that seeds or a clone went out to
[SPEAKER_13]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it was grown, the ounces were a
thousand pounds for one ounce.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a matter of- Back to the diesel
days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I was watching all week in a
walk-in freezer all week with my cousin.
[SPEAKER_16]: And like I was saying earlier,
it could be expensive, but the process you
[SPEAKER_16]: go through can be really complex,
but it can also be really simple.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's definitely a range here that we
can hopefully one day capture more people
[SPEAKER_16]: with and more affordable option that's not
150 for a half grand.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you have 50 people producing
hash, it's no longer going to be that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then again, strains, that's why strain
specific is so important.
[SPEAKER_13]: People can wash away their whole entire
garden without the right strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: So those good hash strains like Marcus is
talking about full melt, full melt
[SPEAKER_13]: certified hash strains are incredibly
valuable to people.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be amazing to start that
program.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you guys did that, that would be- Well,
I'm involved in anything- I'd be in line.
[SPEAKER_15]: Certified.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me tell you, because originally back
right before Mark Emery got arrested,
[SPEAKER_15]: my idea with a friend was let's start a
seed company called Full Melt Genetics and
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll just resell the seeds that we
personally have run and made kick-ass hash
[SPEAKER_15]: with.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the basis of the concept of
the seed idea, the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then the DEA just decided to step
over sovereignty laws and roll into Canada
[SPEAKER_15]: wearing balaclavas and abduct and arrest
Mark Emery and Michelle Rainey and Greg
[SPEAKER_15]: Williams.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_15]: So needless to say, I quickly shut down
the idea of starting a seed bank here in
[SPEAKER_15]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when they arrested Mark, they said
that he was one of the top 100 most wanted
[SPEAKER_15]: criminals in the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was the only one I think from Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: And everyone else was terrorists and the
head of organized criminal syndicates.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they had Mark on this list.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was super scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember something, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, at that time, if you were
arrested and convicted of manufacturing
[SPEAKER_03]: more than 10,000 plants or 100,000,
I forget the exact number.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a million pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: A marijuana kingpin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get the death penalty in
America.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a million pounds and they hit Mark
with that because right before,
[SPEAKER_15]: when they released the announcement,
they claimed that his seeds were
[SPEAKER_15]: responsible for over a million pounds of
cannabis produced in the US.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they used that number specifically
because it is the minimum number.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wouldn't have died from those seeds,
I would have broke two million.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Still, when Mark was supposed to be
extradited and didn't know what was going
[SPEAKER_15]: to happen, and he was like, I'll just take
the rap for everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get Michelle and Greg off and I'll go
down and do whatever I have to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just like, I worked for the
magazine at that time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm selling them just kind of freelance.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was like, you would just go down
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was like, it just wouldn't look good if
I ran.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just face the music.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, but it's possibly the death
penalty.
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you go face the death penalty?
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark always was kind of balls to the wall.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's scary shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll never forget that article when that
came out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: They hit him with everything they could
think of, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: They hit him with everything in the
kitchen thing, too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: It really was crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, I am thinking of cutting it down
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 10 after 12.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got a five-year-old that's just
itching to go play in the snow.
[SPEAKER_15]: It snowed last night.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's very beautiful and snowy out here
in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want to thank the girls in green for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much for sharing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope you'll come back and hang out on
Hash Torch with us sometime.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just invite us for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in like almost 90 Fahrenheit here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see all of you full on fire with
jackets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're here 30 degrees Celsius right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, really, thanks for coming and
sharing your perspective.
[SPEAKER_15]: And keep doing you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And send me a message, and I'll get you
guys those bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Josh and Kelly from
Dragonfly Earth Medicine, as always,
[SPEAKER_15]: for sharing such positive and great
perspectives, ones even that I learned
[SPEAKER_15]: from today, that one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Kelly, you really rocked me with that one
perspective that was quite the opposite of
[SPEAKER_15]: mine.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Marcus, for the opportunity,
for the dialogue we want to give.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The people that we meet here become
lifelong family.
[SPEAKER_13]: Members, and we really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Marcus, you continue to make me think
outside of my box, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to be minus 20 Celsius here
in the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do a FaceTime in both minus 20.
[SPEAKER_15]: I bet you Winnipeg might even be minus 40
by the time I get there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's some dry sift, live dry sift
in the minus 20.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where you do it for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Debbie, for coming in as well
and introducing us to Barbara,
[SPEAKER_15]: your mother, and Danny, and yeah,
just showing us your new dab bar and what
[SPEAKER_15]: you're doing over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate you always have.
[SPEAKER_15]: So keep doing you as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll, of course, have you back to
Hash Church as soon as we can as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: You were muted, but I saw you say thank
you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the thumbs up worked as well.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wade, thanks so much for coming out today
and sharing your smiley face with us.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always appreciate your perspectives as
well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, good session.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure we'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_15]: Brian, we're going to get you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you already ordered a new mic.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go deep, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it's a Hash Church or whether it's
just our own kind of show geeking out on
[SPEAKER_15]: this, I would like to talk about it for
hours myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know you can as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focusing on publishing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be more just reference
material to go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rebuilt and restructured the company in
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2020 is just building on what we did
last year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you just fixed your mic for your
last statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, I'm just did this
actually work now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's no crackling.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was messing with it in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually researching and modifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you'll see both me and Johnny B this
Wednesday for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: We might just whip out to Victoria and go
see Jack Phillips, who was our guest last
[SPEAKER_15]: week.
[SPEAKER_15]: Who spoke about the opioid crisis,
getting drug users off of drugs by giving
[SPEAKER_15]: away free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he sort of started this really cool
concept that we're going to go cover a
[SPEAKER_15]: little more in depth and just him sharing
on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we're going to say thanks to
Colin for coming out over there on the
[SPEAKER_15]: East Coast.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to hang out with your brother as
always.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for giving me a platform,
brother, as always, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess Dr. Mark is going to play us out.
[SPEAKER_15]: With some Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hash music.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, let's see.
[SPEAKER_17]: We used to have a song, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like, on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to make verses for everybody who's
on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nah, just play your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got Stunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_17]: Stinking Up Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: They always got something brewing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we got PTN.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting up to medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Using those LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got lots to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: About the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: On Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Mark.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the best.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are all the best.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Hash Church.
Yay!
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace out, everybody.
