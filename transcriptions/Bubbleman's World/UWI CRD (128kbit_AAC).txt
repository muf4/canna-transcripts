[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here at the University of West
Indies on the campus just in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Usain Bolt track that he obviously
practiced on for many years and helped him
[SPEAKER_00]: win some gold medals in running obviously,
one of the fastest men on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm here to talk to you guys a
little bit about the standardizations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be coming to Jamaica in the
near future and how we're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to test the cannabis that all the local
farmers and all the companies that come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and make their attempts at growing,
whether they're using local farmers or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're bringing people in,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have the plans on doing a little
bit of both, obviously using as many local
[SPEAKER_00]: people as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the worries is standardizations
and one of the machines right now that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being promoted as the new standard in
Jamaica is the Quanticam from Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is quite a unique machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grind up the herb and it takes
this little photograph and moisture and it
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of has a reference of the product
that's photographing and it references the
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they've done a thousand
tests for different strains with gas
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatograph or LCP or whatever it is,
liquid chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which ones they did,
but it's basically a reference model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the beginning of what we will get to
in the future, but in the meantime,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the University of West Indies,
they have all the machines on point here
[SPEAKER_00]: on campus that would be used in regards to
standardizing the medicine and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to test for microbials, molds,
THC percentages, cannabinoid percentages,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also stripping down and breaking
the terpene and terpenoid contents down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there's even monoterpenoids
and sesquicenteroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the science gets more and more complex
the deeper you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the main reasons CRD and
UCAN has signed a contract and an MOU with
[SPEAKER_00]: the University of West Indies because we
know that they're the people for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the students available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the machines available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it really is is a little bit of a
synergistic relationship of us bringing a
[SPEAKER_00]: few key people in to help train the,
for instance, the proton HNMR that is
[SPEAKER_00]: being used here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two of them, a 250 megahertz as
well as a 500 megahertz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be going to see those
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those machines have the ability to do more
than most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things that they don't do,
GC and liquid chromatograph and then mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spec, all of these are available here with
people who are on them and trained and
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when UCAN and CRD just brings
a small amount of key people in to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: training, you're really going to see some
standards take place here on the island in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to talk too much more
about it, but I want you guys to go check
[SPEAKER_00]: out United Cannabis' new page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the link for their YouTube page
right in the bottom of this video so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to look and Google for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just be able to click the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see Tony Verzura along with
Maurice Ellis from Sunspice Seasonings
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing a little bit about the
situation here in Jamaica and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about the proton HNMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check that out and we will catch up
with you guys soon on Bubble Man's World,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to film some of this campus
mural, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the building over there that we
were going to do the greenhouse project
[SPEAKER_01]: on, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see them today or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going away from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonet Institute of Applied Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just parked by the banana trees,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our own toxicity reports, we're not
able to do this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of trapped us, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check, check.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're walking the corridors of the
Faculty of Science and Technology now
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the medical science that you were
at before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Engineering, these were all science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Engineering, life sciences, chemistry,
physics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the basic science, but it's not
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
So.
Yeah, we had to sign the whole line.
We've been working on the contract for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contract allows us to pay you to set
some fees for exploring and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also offer to bring it on staff and
offer to take it to the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop it on campus and make it develop
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do a box for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make like, you know,
own your 30% on a group of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they offer a box of what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's fair to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to find out what's working,
what's not working, what slows drugs down,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you can't use for other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's find out what's good with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest, let's stop using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not going to solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: 40%?
[SPEAKER_01]: 30%?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10%?
100%?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what it comes down to for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen too much anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen what it does to hundreds of
thousands of patients who don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they rely on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents are being ridiculed by
11-year-olds on P2 drops and P4 drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has no violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a non-verbal, violent autistic child.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't express violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's eating food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you know, metallic stuff,
NMRs, is going to attract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be very careful with the metallic
things that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's magnetic, nuclear resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to stay on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stay on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait there for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magnetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to muck up the cameras,
though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yours is more expensive than mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is prime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not magnetic film.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean the components in the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one you can't get around because it's
too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a supercritical fluid extractor,
even though it doesn't belong to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supercritical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do supercritical CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying this is supercritical CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks totally different than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you what ours looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we do most of our
drug-herb interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the AX acleon or whatever they are?
[SPEAKER_02]: The data.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something Brent would really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started a medical cannabis company six
years ago in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We formed a Canadian, U.S., Jamaican-based
company in Jamaica with some people that
[SPEAKER_01]: graduated from here before, as well as
some seasoned agricultural scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got stem cell scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to spare you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have an agreement with the
principal to work on campus, which is why
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt that they're particularly
interested in NMR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, I did call for a
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did call a report, and I can't get any
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what I want to do is to verify
it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at CSU in Colorado, one of the
guys that's on our team graduated many
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been using proton NMR analysis
for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually been sneaking in
products and cannabis-based products that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about and studying them for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't allow us to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we're over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your new bill that just passed
allows us to study this for scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we would love to do is bring
somebody on campus that can teach you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: how to read the data and maybe help the
staff understand the vital components.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the only person.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how normal he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, tell me, it's worked every
day?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mostly graduate students use both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for other structural uses,
we can use more persons we can match,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe like phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a code for phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a molding material code.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a carbon protein in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one I've seen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the standards that have never
been used in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we want to help develop here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizing each PLC with a mass spec that
you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then judging the proton NMR allows us
to certify the crops and then certify the
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So standards should be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a process that we want to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want science.
[SPEAKER_01]: The background is B.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: in science and engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my heart's here trying to find out all
the scientific reasoning for things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking eventually maybe this lab
would be involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see clearly how yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what's being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the moment, it's a tool for
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for graduate students, it's research.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We extract things from plants and test
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do some due diligence on the equipment
if you don't mind us just kind of filming
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so we take some pictures and show the
other scientists what tools you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since you're alone here, you might
like the company.
This is okay to go in then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who can help us, just let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
