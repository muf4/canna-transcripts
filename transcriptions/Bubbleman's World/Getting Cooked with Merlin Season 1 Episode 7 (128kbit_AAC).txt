[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Brixton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brixton's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the chef, Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, getting cooked with Merlin is about
to begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We figured first things first,
get cooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you've already got your dab
pre-loaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: You low temp motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I never choke myself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, that's not the one I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're going to do a little
cooking here, but we figured we'd start
[SPEAKER_03]: with a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually going to do a dessert
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm excited, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: A quick dessert you can make in like 15
minutes when you're baked at 10 o'clock at
[SPEAKER_02]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good amount of time for a
dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fast, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that for you, Brixton?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was asking for one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a super great taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to concentrated X for the
strawberry banana hash rosin that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: puffing on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll light a joint too for a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorgeous day out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorgeous day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The orcas are out in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already had multiple friends in the
village here texting me, telling me that
[SPEAKER_03]: the pod of orca killer whales are out in
the house sounds such a beautiful,
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful area that we are in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's truly, it's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the orcas, got the dolphins,
sea lions and seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mountains right now, the snow is
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really riding pretty often,
as I've been saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been trying to get up to
Cyprus, which is our much more local
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain for Merle and I, just 20 minutes
really from here to the parking lot in
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyprus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you say that's what it takes you?
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes longer from the highway up to the
parking lot than it does from there to
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The exit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how busy it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I have been getting up to
Whistler and definitely taken lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet shots up there and just vibing out
in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite thing to do really both
in the summer and the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the summer, I'm up there on dirt
bikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the winter, it's like sleds and
snowboards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during the week you're making hash and
I'm helping the seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Merlin and I are working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's over at Lifeson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lifest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Canmart really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's Canmart.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to get this right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've just changed their name to
Lifest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working with us over at Embark.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had our sale go through with Bev
Canna, which now they're called Naturo.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you keep up with all of this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lifer, so it really doesn't matter
what the banner is that I do these things
[SPEAKER_03]: under.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just always doing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty excited to get some of
these products going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to get the Bubble Man brand out
there with the actual hash that I want and
[SPEAKER_03]: the rosin that I want, that is a dream
come true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it's a small group, but they're a
group that recognizes quality when they
[SPEAKER_03]: see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really who that will be for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to make it affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not $100 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to see it be closer to 40% less than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be good to have some legal stuff to
dab sometimes, because right now there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not enough anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I did hit some of that Afghan
Kush that we made a while ago and sold
[SPEAKER_03]: under the Hank brand, it was lacking in
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have a great flavor,
but I cannot deny how strong that hash is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close to 70%, but even though it's the
number that means anything, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever is modulating it, because it's
not just THCA, whatever is modulating it
[SPEAKER_03]: just makes it really heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still to this day, it's the best hash I
have for going to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm all amped up and I'm like,
I just hit it up, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking a lot of these,
just smearing like I was saying on these
[SPEAKER_02]: joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smearing joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smearing live resin on the joint,
and that's a good night joint I have to
[SPEAKER_02]: say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it burns pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of flour you got in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is wedding cake with Girls Go Cookie
live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not a lightweight doobie.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a pretty hardcore doobie,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, it's burning like you were
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually blue smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's burning clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very blue smoke, and it has a light ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't smoked a joint in a very,
very, very, very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm excited to get watching you make
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to make something in 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we surprising them?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making chocolate raspberry lava
cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's the best for late at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually gluten free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because you, of course,
just had this discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get pretty experimental in
cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've always kind of been pretty
experimental with cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just a shift on the
experiments that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's much easier to do than
say go from a regular person that just
[SPEAKER_03]: cooks kind of blandly and doesn't
experiment a lot to just trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You experiment, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, open up the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, look at this, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make that today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever made it before?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, no, no, but we can make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This recipe here, I do it all the time
because it's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like nine o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Munchies, nothing to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got cooked, getting cooked, doing some
cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with some tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you, amigo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very nice of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little mint tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's cook some lava cake.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's going to make for four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty simple ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need four eggs, five ounces of
chocolate, one and a half tablespoons of
[SPEAKER_02]: gluten-free flour, some raspberry jam,
some sugar, a bit of vanilla, and four
[SPEAKER_02]: tablespoons of butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just toss the butter in with the
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, in she goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for like one minute and 30 seconds
at 50% power, and then just toss it after.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they missed out on seeing
that, so I wanted to give them the best,
[SPEAKER_03]: not so good view.
[SPEAKER_02]: While that's going, get your little
ramekins good.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you want to do it is you want to push
it up like this so that it rises properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a bit of butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a bit of sugar in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just toss that around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to just coat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just make sure that the cake
doesn't stick to the sides when it rises.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just make sure that it's coated all on
the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest of the chash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate dash butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate slash butter starts to melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix all that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably have to put it back in the
microwave for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised at how melted it was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise you can do a double boiler,
but that takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of got to pay attention to that thing
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a walk away and down
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This you can do at your house super fast
at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: First we'll start with the eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eggs in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then two egg yolks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will make it super creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the chocolate sit for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll lift these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to beat it so that it's nice and
consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a bit of vanilla in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get a little bit of salt in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and salt with the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to do chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it nice and consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we'll mix the chocolate in with the
eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make this all mix nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to whip nice so that it rises
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now get a bit of flour in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need very much flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have done this and forgotten
the flour before and it still worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like a souffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the oven is on at 475.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really key point to when you
start this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start the oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 475.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we'll pour these things in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try not to drip any on the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want to keep just a little bit left
in here so that we can cover up the jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a bit of jam here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of push it down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of scoop it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover that little jammy, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way it becomes part of the lava.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of just smooth it over just
to make sure there's no jam exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now toss them on the pan so that the heat
gets distributed evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In they go.
[SPEAKER_02]: In they go.
[SPEAKER_02]: For eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can do dabs and make whipped cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can have our dab that we've all
cleaned up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need my torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, torchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll show them out the window on
such a beautiful day in Lion's Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a beautiful day in Lion's Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where the orcas were out here
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were actually out over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And had we been here with the camera we
probably would have been seeing them right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were swimming around north of that
island right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a great view at this spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Band of windows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear the sound beckoning the eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use my temp tech if you wanted
or just heat it up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoon the balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plan is to, was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The plan is to make some whipped cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little vanilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of vanilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little sugar, sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is my machine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your machine?
[SPEAKER_02]: I misplaced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You found it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what machine is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's like a little blender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cream whipper?
[SPEAKER_02]: A cream whipper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like way easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like such a ridiculous thing to just
pull out of the drawer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there it is folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're baked, you've been enjoying some
fine cannabis or extracts or edibles or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make this cake real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a real fast one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put the ingredients list in the
description.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Merlin said this is the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried to get it down to 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 was about as close as he got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be more rushing than we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're doing a slower version for you
guys here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, I don't think it'll be much
more than 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there is one minute and 30 seconds
left and we got pretty much everything set
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our whipped cream is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some strawberry powder too.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little strawberry powder?
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry powder, hey?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just an extract, a strawberry
fruit powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be ready any second here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then just take a knife, gently go around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can get out, eh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you put the sugar too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps it to not stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can definitely see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sugar's doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't add any sugar besides the
semi-sweet chocolate that we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of recipes will tell you to add
sugar, but I don't think it needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now this is where it gets a
little trickier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're not just going to serve them
in those little cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to try to flip them upside
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be very fast if you are going to
touch them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful grabbing them if you are going
to grab them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now give them a little...
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was like harder and louder than
I would have anticipated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just waiting for one of those things
to break.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this one's not as green.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lava popped first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that little guy, eh?
That
[SPEAKER_01]: one's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come out fucked up sometimes too,
but they still taste just as good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one definitely looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to add a little of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to make it just for our show here,
a little weed leaf, a little strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so sweet, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first I was like, what is it he is
doing here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's a lot to put on there,
Merlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting cooked with Merlin is always fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little imprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes artistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes he does art.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one didn't work out as good,
but it's still going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we are with our teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just picture perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you guys can see the cool weed leaf
insignia there that he put on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's take our opening hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this one, look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best munchy trip ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just exploded into the cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gluten-free, don't say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's over the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really eat treats too much these
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was like a sugar blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not too sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're going to go and crush this
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a joy to film you making awesome,
delicious preparations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I should appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back when we're back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers out, everybody.
Cheers out, everybody.
