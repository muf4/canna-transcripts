[SPEAKER_00]: little shot to get that last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love the niche cap super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you niche such a good nice gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Got another one given to me from
spacewalk And I really love it as well
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks like the top of his jars if
you ever look at niche His glass his
[SPEAKER_00]: little His little cap is the top all of
his pipes have this mouthpiece on them so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty cool little thing I think that
oh my net my egg is about like just under
[SPEAKER_00]: nine inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Yeah, it is pretty short little
fat little stout little egg One day I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not connected to these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of sharing Them and
passing them on letting them get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're beautiful They're you know,
it's not like it was given to me or that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have some special connection to it You
know what Adam Sinclair that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good one, but I'm not going out of respect
for my wife I will not answer that I love
[SPEAKER_00]: to make jokes But not with my wife at the
but end of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pun intended Would love to own a bubble
man mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go Nicholas Cross they
come up for sale every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold my Taurus I sold my straight fab
and what do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Klein I have a mini frosted mini
and I have this egg as well as another one
[SPEAKER_00]: That I've been waiting for this deadbeat
to pay me back I've been so good and not
[SPEAKER_00]: blasting this guy because I know how many
people follow me and it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes a good idea to make your own
personal gripes public So I always sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: would say to people listen if you have a
problem with someone and you feel like the
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing to do Is call them out in
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's probably not the best thing to
do They might be going through some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things in their life and it's best if you
just have some cash compassion and some
[SPEAKER_00]: empathy for them even though you're in the
situation where you're feeling wronged and
[SPEAKER_00]: not to do that not to call those people
out because I just don't think it brings
[SPEAKER_00]: any positivity to anyone I don't think we
all need to what's the purpose in waking
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the morning and trying to build and
Get your followers to be against someone
[SPEAKER_00]: or to feel negative in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Me what I'm trying to do with this
thing is and I've already failed miserably
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of times I've gotten a little
upset and I've gotten pissed off here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I am human No, no, no,
no one broke my egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke my egg long time ago broke the
neck right here Perfect snapped it off
[SPEAKER_00]: sent it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me back with this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little R right on the bottom
It's not going to affect the sale of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like it better with the new neck
actually Well, that's what that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to what are my thoughts on
Frenchy cannoli?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Frenchy cannoli has very different
belief systems than me in regards to hash
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time my thoughts on
Frenchy cannoli are that he's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: kindred soul a kindred brother a brother
in hashish a hashish aficionado He loves
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish and so my thoughts are good I
think Frenchy cannoli is good and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: good for hashish and he's good for the
people and if he says things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different in some Times even
the opposite of what I say who am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: To say otherwise, I mean someone's got to
cover the opposite of what I'm saying And
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just because it's the
opposite of what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly doesn't mean that it's wrong
It's just different and as I learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: the quiver I have an appreciation for all
things Different for all things unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Frenchy is a good person and my
thoughts are that I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a kind person and All-around lover of
hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I could say about Frenchy
cannoli now five ten years ago I might
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone on and on and on about how I
thought he was wrong about this and wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: about that and he should this is how I do
it and this is what I would do and blah
[SPEAKER_00]: blah blah blah, but really You know get
over yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what people need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need everything They don't need
just what you have they need everything So
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't try to stunt or quiet or or
muffle anyone else's voice because exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: Octo Tom we all have our own way and we
all have our own voice So it does come
[SPEAKER_00]: with maturity, you know, it's I was
immature for a long time I had my own
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurities about things in life but as I
am a humbled father of three and The
[SPEAKER_00]: humble husband of a beautiful wife for
well close to 30 years now I've learned to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit more patient and look at
things from a little bit more of a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and so that is the perspective
that I'm looking at things these days in
[SPEAKER_00]: the meantime When can we hang out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can hang out September 9th and
10th in Toronto at the Karma Cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: although I was going to do an unboxing
video I kind of feel like I still possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: could but I'm gonna do it right here

[SPEAKER_00]: it Sorry Christopher Reese, I just can't
make them all you know where in Toronto,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why don't I find out?

announced closer to the time Let's see
[SPEAKER_00]: September 9th and 10th competition live
music speakers downtown Toronto,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I guess that's That's about as close as

certain things I'm not sure if she has
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy VIP judges that you can just judge

[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to pass it on to all of you
What was that question do I know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices psoriasis and topicals well I know
cannabinoids work on almost anything so
[SPEAKER_00]: without knowing much about much you could
easily start experimenting through
[SPEAKER_00]: bioassay if you have psoriasis With
creating your own bombs which is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: simply enough find out what's not
irritating to your skin Maybe some shea
[SPEAKER_00]: nut butter, maybe some coconut Oil,
maybe even some Naomi coconut oil extract
[SPEAKER_00]: the further Distilled if you will it's
quite the singing voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that Hello from Bavaria
here in Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is impossible to get good oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I press myself with a hair straightener
That's the way to do it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear that oh Yeah, we've been
smoking hard and killed to one fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can smoke more it is a wake and
bake Why not right let me turn on the D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail because that's always nice I don't
always like to torch like three four times
[SPEAKER_00]: in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of loud I don't like the way it
sounds when we're filming John Burfellow
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to what might he have more info
he could John has much info he's a man of
[SPEAKER_00]: many hats from processing and growing and
running a business I Got some fire flower
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin hey you guys want to see Some fire
fire rosin go check out my Instagram at BC
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble man or the new one at bubble man
brand Just all one word go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a follow over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have like 3,000 followers so far
But look at the last picture of the turp
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin that that the video that Tony took
That is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you dry sifting rub the real
dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we knew that was fire the second We
saw it so very excited for that To be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to I guess people at rosin or at rosin
people at chalice if you see Tony V
[SPEAKER_00]: walking around or if you guys know the
guys at the green dragon the real green
[SPEAKER_00]: dragon Go see them go see if they've got
any left cuz yeah might be worth checking
[SPEAKER_00]: out Might be worth checking out And then I
guess Tony was entered a whole shwack of
[SPEAKER_00]: times I think he entered One bubble man
brand into chalice, but I know he entered
[SPEAKER_00]: like three or four with gold drop Grandpa
Ketchum in Vancouver definitely you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want to go check out Sunrise
Wellness They probably have some fire Ross
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe some fire melts from West Coast
concentrate The best rosin I've had has
[SPEAKER_00]: probably just been stuff that I've made I
love I love a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff when you surround yourself with
exceptional quality and people who really
[SPEAKER_00]: push themselves to have exceptional
quality I find that the best is
[SPEAKER_00]: Reoccurring often and shows up in
different places and shows up in different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars and even different processes So
I just love perfectly grown cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: resins that have expressed themselves to
full potential And I love of course of
[SPEAKER_00]: whole host and variety of terpenes and
terpene profiles Well That makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that weed makes you lazy people try
to say weed makes you lazy when I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it as a tool and how I lost 150 115
pounds yeah, I don't find that it makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy at all I feel that certain people who
are overworked and just in this mentality
[SPEAKER_00]: of being a zombie there might be a level
of being baked and on a couch that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go through to unbrainwash
themselves from the current reality that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been in and I went through that as
a younger person I remember being super
[SPEAKER_00]: not motivated and just hanging out and
being baked and that was just as my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: was adjusting to cannabis and my body was
adjusting to having it back and I lost
[SPEAKER_00]: that very quickly and very early on it
became extremely active and In fact when I
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis, I want to go do something
that's active I don't want to just sit
[SPEAKER_00]: around and be you know I'd rather go for a
hike or a bike ride or a snowboard or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, a wake skate or whatever Yeah,
they're not puffing on 73 bubbles melt 73
[SPEAKER_00]: knows He knows Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, love me some 73, you know,
and then there's the real 73 Which is if
[SPEAKER_00]: you use the eight bag kit, but you remove
the 90 micron and let that all fall into
[SPEAKER_00]: the 73 We used to call that everyone needs
the haze Christopher Reese We used to call
[SPEAKER_00]: that well, I just called it the 73 But
once I got the 90 and we'd make batches
[SPEAKER_00]: without the 90 we'd call it the real 73
That's what we call it Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the real 73 or the true 73 that
works, too Yeah Hayes gets you motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh You're most welcome one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got a couple hundred people
in the room I think it's a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: core group of people that we've had
Probably for the last maybe four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: or six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure, you know hard to say
jobless once again The favorite thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything's a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that my mind works that way
anymore I mean it might in certain aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of things when there's very when there's
no second place But with the motherships
[SPEAKER_00]: what they all have is their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain times I love the blasting chug
of a ball rig or The Faberge egg they chug
[SPEAKER_00]: these are chug mother ships Then you have
the more almost like a Silencer on your
[SPEAKER_00]: gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the Klein and the Taurus
both of those hit in this real sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have this Crazy chugging
feeling they're more relaxed and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have your mini and the mini or and the
straight fab for that matter as well Which
[SPEAKER_00]: are much more open and hit more like a
Swiss perk the the straight fab hits more
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Swiss perk the Mini it just hits
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open, but it's a very short space
that it's traveling so it's still quite
[SPEAKER_00]: tight and it's very small and I just like
them all I really do like them all then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the FTK also the FKT I never went
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always called it the FTK which is like a
fab egg a Taurus and a Klein all stacked
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of one another that one to me felt
You know, there was a hype because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the most expensive the most
sought-after one Because it's all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty unique and it definitely hits
really cool, but it hits very very like
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really pulling on the FTK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them hit more open than others But
generally if you're used to hitting any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other single pieces, you'll find that
the FTK hits a little a little tighter
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going on fat a Mike chooch Zach
Willie and black starliner Talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: it means to only have resin in the 25 you
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't see It very often if
you're talking about making bubble hash
[SPEAKER_00]: All only having resin in the 25 micron bag
I'd almost right away Think that your bag
[SPEAKER_00]: kid if it wasn't bubble bags and even if
it was for that matter not that we've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it But I would wonder if the screens
were mistaken and maybe bigger screens got
[SPEAKER_00]: put on for the other seven bags
Accidentally or some screens were mixed up
[SPEAKER_00]: But 25 microns very small heads even in
places like Australia where the Sun is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely hot and really cooks those heads
down Into tiny little heads where full
[SPEAKER_00]: full full mount resin comes out of the 25
and the 45 micron I still see Resin in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other bags So I'm not too sure that's you
might have just cut it down like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know that's even like so early to get all
Premature like all small little heads like
[SPEAKER_00]: that unless you're growing like in the
extreme heat of like the Australian Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna produce smaller heads
Otherwise if you're growing indoor or
[SPEAKER_00]: almost anywhere in the world, that's not
tropical outdoor Then it's likely that
[SPEAKER_00]: those heads were never really fully
allowed to mature Possible early early
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah fata me too man, I like hanging
out and talking with you guys I always try
[SPEAKER_00]: to just make it like a not too long,
but not too short It's always nice when
[SPEAKER_00]: the information flows naturally and we can
just have great conversations without too
[SPEAKER_00]: Much awkwardness Like I said, I'm excited
for any of you that are gonna be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood of the Karma Cup come see me
I'm gonna be speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be out of booth I'll have Blue
River terpenes and I'm sure I'll have dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll be dabbing everyone out with as
always Just won't be selling the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're at Chalice, you can go check
out the real green dragon I believe they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be selling the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although probably not it'll probably be
one of those things where they just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it and say no This is just personal head
stash for the crew but we'll see let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you guys run into the real green
dragon say hello from the bubble man and
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go follow those guys on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a chance give this video a like
if you get a chance or Don't whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, I don't want to ask you
to do anything that you don't want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: seems ridiculous It's like hey man,
like my video fuck your video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit about your video

Google go find him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is all about his Chasie bangers.

[SPEAKER_00]: Much like that Congo rip was Yum,
oh Yeah, that's delicious that's tasty and
[SPEAKER_00]: we won't be producing any Chasie bangers
here No, actually quite the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: Anomalaya when I switched to concentrates
I was at a point where I was smoking so
[SPEAKER_00]: much cannabis that my I had hit a ceiling
There was no more getting past Where I
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly was and it was kind of a little
bit of a bummer and then I got into Excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me a little bit of cough there then I got
into the concentrates and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was basically every time I hit the I do
not get a lot of phlegm No, I do not I
[SPEAKER_00]: woke up a little bit feeling like a tiny
bit of a cold today from my little son But
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's already most almost blown
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might sound a little more nasally than
usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Shvet Anatoly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome I don't speak Russian but I'm
gonna think that you might have said
[SPEAKER_00]: something like hello from Russia or how's
it going hash family and Either way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's wicked to have some people in here
from Russia I just think the world is such
[SPEAKER_00]: a cool place and we've been so tricked
with trying to Be divided by our borders
[SPEAKER_00]: and our languages and our cultural
differences and they are great dividers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong When we can elevate
ourselves beyond and above those things we
[SPEAKER_00]: really start to respect those things
instead of Resent them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for me anytime I go to any country I
feel like honored to be in the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: another Cultural group to eat their food
to listen to their music to dance to be
[SPEAKER_00]: with the people It's just a good thing
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah Right on we're happy to have you here
Shvet Anatoly and I hope you're dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you are in the motherland because
wow Russia That's a big country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like Canada, you know, like when
you're from Russia to people say hey Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you must know so-and-so they live near Cuz
it's like you'll see that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a friend from Halifax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know him?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like well, no, I live like 7,000
miles away and fairly far from your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: respect from Germany John 420 Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have you Yeah, of course Chuck
that is the attitude to have while
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling and that's usually when you're a
traveler You know, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling because those are the things
you're seeking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeking out these cultural
differences You want to experience other
[SPEAKER_00]: human beings living on planet Earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: in a different way with a different vibe
and How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sooner than later bingo Lombardi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's drop another dab Sam will be is

there you go I'll tell you the Russians
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Dutch have a good relationship or
they did back in the day when the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: showed the Russians how to sail and Wow,
did Russia ever do a lot with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a museum in Amsterdam that you can
go to and it is kind of treasures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tsar in from Russia and it's the only
place in the world these treasures ever
[SPEAKER_00]: leave Russia to go and it's because Of
this relationship with Amsterdam Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: the Netherlands teaching The Russians
about sailing and building boats and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, this I went with skunk man Sam
and his wife one time Maybe I even just

some different languages happening today.

[SPEAKER_00]: of the higher numbers for the waking wake
and bake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Going to harborside in a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's happening at a
harborside right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to ask I might have to find
out what's fresh on the menu because You
[SPEAKER_00]: know for for the bubble man brand We're
really really just getting things going
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and the places that we've worked
with that have produced property a product
[SPEAKER_00]: for us so far hasn't been harborside,
but I know harborside has some material
[SPEAKER_00]: coming down in the near future and We will
absolutely be working with some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Very nice man visiting the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss visiting the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go at least Once a year
sometimes two three times a year anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fly into Europe I would fly into
Amsterdam first and then of course every
[SPEAKER_00]: year the Cannabis Cup Damn near 20 years
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I do miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Did give away two pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys send me those emails and
in the email I want to see episode 80 I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see The pin that you won and that
you want and then I just want in one real
[SPEAKER_00]: nice separated spot your name and your
full address So I can just copy and paste
[SPEAKER_00]: it that would be super helpful and I do
appreciate it And I'm sure Sarah
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciates it and I'm sure you guys
appreciate it So always happy to be giving
[SPEAKER_00]: away some things here and there What do I
think of hash out in Washington State?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jimmy I've heard good things about
hash in Washington State It's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually just hanging out over at
the what is it the hub studio?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the hub studio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to link Them on my Instagram,
but you must have seen some of the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've posted recently I was lucky
enough to go and visit team Japan Busting
[SPEAKER_00]: out some absolutely ridiculous glass
They're all building a cup right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: dosa is also up from Washington State and
he was just saying that it's quite quite
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful in Washington State right now
with the quality and the Access that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have so good for Washington State sure all
sorts of people have complete Complaints
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's not the best and I'm sure
it's overtaxed and I'm sure it's blah blah
[SPEAKER_00]: blah blah blah But let's just be happy
with what we have not fight against it and
[SPEAKER_00]: fight instead Instead we're going to fight
For more for what you want You can get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want without fighting against
what already exists when we have our foot
[SPEAKER_00]: in the door You know fighting against this
foot-in-the-door mentality approach is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very dangerous thing to fight against
because it's how the cannabis movement has
[SPEAKER_00]: Moved us forward to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's ever happened major It's been
these tiny little foot in the doors and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way through you've had these
people saying no That's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't accept that we can't have it like
that if we can't have it the way we want
[SPEAKER_00]: it We don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like who the fuck is that guy talking
for because I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Want whatever I can get and then I want
more and more and more and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course We'd love to have it
instantaneous, but holy shit man like
[SPEAKER_00]: people fighting against access that
already exists Is completely insane We
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get our foot in the door each and
every time and if we can get more than our
[SPEAKER_00]: foot in the door great But don't cut out
one step at a time because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump 20 steps You know the movement itself
is not an Olympic long jumper It's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not so baby steps right baby steps as
Richard Dreyfus says in the classic Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: Murray movie They call me Bob Or sorry,
what about Bob?
[SPEAKER_00]: your memory Yeah, what about Bob?
[SPEAKER_00]: classic What about Bob Nicholas knows what
about Bob Chris Flores knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome That's it look I'm sailing Tell us
a pirate joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you a pirate joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you all my pirate jokes How many
pirate jokes do you think I have I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly?
[SPEAKER_00]: BC bubble man at icloud.com What does the
pirate say on his 80th birthday?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 80 get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he says
[SPEAKER_00]: I Know it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones that you're not
really laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good way to finish it bubble man not
a good way to finish it But you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: someone might have gotten some enjoyment
out of that and if one person got
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyment out of it Maybe everyone else
can you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: sit on their annoyance Right, I'll be your
rep for bubble man brand, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow that's not that's easier said than
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't cross State lines so anywhere we
set that up we have to have our labs
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing everything has to be done in
that state So I think that'll be the horse
[SPEAKER_00]: before the cart you can be the cart But we
got to get the horse in there first and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get into more States give
people access.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's about right there Well,
it was better than a pirate joke it was
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the pirate joke I was thinking
of well I told another one a while ago
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter s which was Kind of like my funniest
pirate joke, which was the classic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the guy walks into the bar He's
got a steering wheel coming out of his
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts Out of his crotch and he and he's a
pirate and he the bartender says,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my god Does does that hurt and he says
our it's driving me nuts So like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a funny pirate joke, but I've told
it before it is what it is Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have any on the East Coast bubble man
not as of yet Not as of yet, New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Got my finger kind of pinched about a
few weeks ago and now there's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sensitive nerve in the outside part
right here and I just kind of pinched it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's Whoo, I think we better fix that
with a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I do the Swiss perk?
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice I looked at my sapphire just
wasn't clean enough Yeah, soil King brand
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know about that but all right
favorite rig someone already asked me that
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them all the one that I'm using
currently ie that can change the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Certain ones I prefer to travel
with more than other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense so There's
different times, you know, if I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the boat, there's certain time
There's certain ones that I like to have
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh That sucks chillin like a villain I
hope I didn't like do some crazy nerve
[SPEAKER_00]: damage that'll never be fixed it didn't
even make a mark on my pinky but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: right in there and I definitely pinched it
between the boat and the Dock was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: one right at the start of boating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like this is gonna hurt all day,
but it didn't I was kind of surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis Actually is quite amazing for
pain management and it's almost more like
[SPEAKER_00]: it just takes the attention from the pain
receptors Away and puts them on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors and it's like hey,
look over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels better.
It's weird
[SPEAKER_00]: Mmm How big of a part is taste and smell
when it comes to your relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hashish I would love to come
to st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birders Petersburg and swim luncheon
Channel Rivers and see beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking about that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always stay In the Krasnopolski
hotel in Amsterdam and I'd always made me
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go to Russia
[SPEAKER_00]: Little wheeze in the in the cough there
Little wheezy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some wheezing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Tastes everything smells not
that important to you though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Brian literal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think smell and taste are definitely
important They're not always the same ie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it won't smell as good as it
tastes Sometimes it doesn't taste as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice when it tastes as good as
it smells Like really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Sanger as well at the V 230 The
Sanger yes, my boat is a Sanger You can't
[SPEAKER_00]: taste without your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go Smell dictates buzz to
a degree Elliot, but it's yeah It's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you really like it and you get
excited you almost know your your your
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness knows Oh, this is gonna be a
good collaboration You know because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like those those receptors are really
receiving some of those components when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're smelling them into your olfactory
the turps Absolutely those terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinoids Mine's a What is mine a 2007
2007 I purchased weed last night that
[SPEAKER_00]: smells amazing, but give it almost nothing
when squished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not squishing Properly or
though maybe you know how to squish
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and it's really just maybe not
enough moisture You could try Boveda packs
[SPEAKER_00]: get that moisture content back up there
moisture is a huge huge Helping factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: this in when you squish as squishing
really is a steam distillation process
[SPEAKER_00]: here Steaming the moisture out of the bud
and that's melting the resonant and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing and carrying it outward as the
moisture evaporates and disappears You
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want too much in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it tends to stay in the rosin
and then you get that poppy crackling
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Don't feel that way Tony D all those
people are incredible In their own right
[SPEAKER_00]: and why would you want to cut yourself off
from good information if it's out there Go
[SPEAKER_00]: support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge everyone when we turn this off to
go support the show It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel wronged You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Todd and I have been talking about
doing another show for a long time So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: natural that he would want to do a show
After making the decision after kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: putting me in a position where I had to
choose him or someone else And I just said
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I'm not choosing anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying anyone can come at any
time and if the conversation is Is is
[SPEAKER_00]: proper and it's like I need to invite this
person in right now I can't feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's gonna feel blindsided by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna say don't feel bad in
supporting that show and It's all good
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gunkman Sam and Tom Alexander and K
and all those guys are good dudes You
[SPEAKER_00]: should I don't want to create any division
in any way shape or form those go a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys are mentors and so Yeah,
let's let's not create the division You
[SPEAKER_00]: know and if you do go in there be
respectful if you're gonna be trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent me Don't be upset for me be

[SPEAKER_00]: show is called talking with cannabis and
