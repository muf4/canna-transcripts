[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they can come up with
evidence on cannabis that sort of turns it
[SPEAKER_04]: into something so dangerous that you can
sustain treating it in this restrictive
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really need to acknowledge that all
of these years we lied about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people get their information from a
five-second clip on television or a couple
[SPEAKER_08]: of paragraphs in a newspaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the major benefits of
legalization is a lot more people are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen what a hundred years,
give or take, of stigma have done to just
[SPEAKER_02]: change everyone's perceptions of this
plant to the point where they bear so
[SPEAKER_02]: little resemblance to the actual
properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's terrifying to see how
misinformation can lead to so much
[SPEAKER_02]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still not enough, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that legalization is rolling out,
there's still going to be other fights to
[SPEAKER_09]: take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's different functions
in society.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think activism is an important function.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having enforcement is an important
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think you have education in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Politicians who are catering to emotional
reactions in terms of votes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't stop to talk rationally and
reasonably most of the time about things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's people suffering.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's people, countless people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see somebody who's going through a
financial withdrawal and you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: something to alleviate some of that pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many good things that happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are expected to come up with innovative
solutions to the opioid crisis we find
[SPEAKER_09]: ourselves in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transitions are always, you know,
it's like giving birth to a new life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's an intense process.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I say move things forward,
it's not just about the things that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: very actively trying to move forward here,
but like what could we do next?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you need to protect kids from
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Last time I checked, kids have
endocannabinoid systems too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there with the doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at me and he said, you're a
desperate mother reaching your grasping
[SPEAKER_03]: out straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him, I was like, yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, what are you going to do if I
don't give you this prescription?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm going to go home and I'm going
to do it anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't deny me the chance to save my
child.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabinoids regulate all biological
functions through the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_10]: system.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_06]: Legalization, I mean, it's coming for
everybody and then cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization kicking in especially at this
time, it really is important to be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about these other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have faith in the activists and the
next generation to just continue this
[SPEAKER_05]: movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see this as a point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see this as the destination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if we all keep that in mind
that there have been some pretty big
[SPEAKER_05]: victories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of people writing,
but the ones I respond to the most and the
[SPEAKER_03]: quickest are the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know I've been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you try to take on a medical
system, that's really scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if there was a regulatory market
in place, it might be a real good
[SPEAKER_07]: transition, but there isn't anything in
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, there's this big,
not just a gray area, but a great timeline
[SPEAKER_07]: of when that's going to be and when those
shops can open up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what all those guys are,
baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, I mean,
the plan is going to be a legal entity in
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada and we can do anything we want with
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just change their mind about one little
thing, you know, and then come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: then one more thing, you know,
and then one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we need all the stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're all stories, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A clinical trial is a type of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a piece of that story where
it's so expensive to be able to tell that
[SPEAKER_02]: story that it limits who gets to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what 's so great about
something like Move the Movement is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting other people who have wisdom and
who have important information and
[SPEAKER_02]: important stories to share to share those
stories as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just this one story where the
entrance into the storytelling club is
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awesome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
