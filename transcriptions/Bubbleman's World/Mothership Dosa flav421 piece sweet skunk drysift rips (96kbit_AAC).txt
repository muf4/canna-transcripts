[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made a video in a couple of days
here, aside from our really great Hash
[SPEAKER_00]: Church that we did today, so I thought I
would give you a quick little show of an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible piece that Flav421 dropped off
the other day for a couple of days here
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to get photographs of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Dosa Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so many beautiful things about this
Dosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this perfect opal in the marble
on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this incredible kind of mossy
green colour with the crushed opal in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainbow cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really an incredible chubbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real deep, deep pull to it for
the amount of water that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the D-Nail set in with the
direct injection quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit a little bowl of the
sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a big bowl, actually,
because we're doing dabs for a video here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me count the ways on how that was an
incredible, awesome hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the size of the hit was great,
but the pipe takes the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you put through this thing,
I swear, it just, it pulls with such
[SPEAKER_00]: ferocity that it really is, and for such a
small downstem on the thing, I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how he nailed it, but this is a
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thumbs up on the Dosa Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Flav again for
bringing it by, and I want to thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for the next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
