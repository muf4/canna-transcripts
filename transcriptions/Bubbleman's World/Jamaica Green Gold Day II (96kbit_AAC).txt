[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome you to our panel discussion on
ganja, marijuana, sensimeter, hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really Jamaica's green gold?
[SPEAKER_02]: I should tell you, and I see my beloved
friend and colleague Professor Morrison
[SPEAKER_02]: across the room, I must tell you that my
first and early recollection of ganja is
[SPEAKER_02]: being about nine years old and my brother
being found with a spliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my parents were so agitated and
agitated that my brother could be turning
[SPEAKER_02]: faster and smoking the spliff that has
shipped him off to the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not a very pleasant recollection,
I must say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other recollection I have is
about woman drinking some strong ganja tea
[SPEAKER_02]: and screaming and shouting and speaking
very loudly and I thought this ganja thing
[SPEAKER_02]: is just not ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today I spent the morning looking at
ganja and I thought to myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this thing can't be money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja and other medicinal plants have the
ability to generate revenues for your
[SPEAKER_02]: makeup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give you the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worldwide market for ganja products is
up to 140 to 150 billion US dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at natural products,
those numbers just baffle my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.5 trillion dollars is what Henry who
told us this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, for the first time at last,
I'm sure that there's some of you in the
[SPEAKER_02]: audience that are saying to yourself,
but this ganja thing not so bad enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it's something that we should look
at and so if you were someone who was 80
[SPEAKER_02]: years old in Jamaica, I suppose you'd be
asking, should we really be making ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: products, making products from ganja?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have harmful effects on human
health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people lose their mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they go crazy when they drink some
ganja to have ganja products?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it have medicinal benefits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because today we heard that it's
beneficial and it can help you with nausea
[SPEAKER_02]: after chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a friend, you know,
she said, boy, I wish I had a chickpea for
[SPEAKER_02]: just one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a little soap, a ganja in
some rum and when I drink it, it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen, man, I have to try this
chickpea thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the foreigners, chickpeas are virus
and when you get it, you create a die
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so many pains and so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pains and high fever and arthritis
has a new meaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: When she had it, she said to me,
you know, this ganja thing works.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second question I think that we could
ask, if we are going to go into this ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: business, can we produce enough of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the standards we would need
to meet to grow and use it for medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we register ganja grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they're growing it using
greenhouses or they're growing it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, should we be doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we just synthesize it in the lab,
just make it in the lab?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we are to maintain our competitive
and comparative advantage, shouldn't we
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve the good stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawthorne told us what, today said we have
the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember being at my farm and somebody
says they were growing ganja on my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, no, God, not today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today I said to them, come let me grow
a little ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: You understand me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he said we have the best stuff as
usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But shouldn't we, yes, man, this thing is
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't we be preserving the original
germ class?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big word for making sure that the
real stuff still remains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should we be developing new products so
we can maintain our competitive advantage?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ahead of the competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are the issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our colleagues, one of our
panelists, will look at the economics of
[SPEAKER_02]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're gonna do this thing properly,
we need to have an economic framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look at what incentives are we
gonna put in place?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we gonna help SMEs?
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have to look at how do we find
financing for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we use the regular DBJ funding to
finance it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hear this thing is big business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not small money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how will we finance it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How will we move from research and
development to products?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we gonna get that innovation into
something that is bankable and which
[SPEAKER_02]: people want to finance?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the questions that we will be
looking at in this discussion this
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have Dr. Winston Delahaye,
who will look at the medicinal and health
[SPEAKER_02]: implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a little bit more about him
so you can tell whether when you smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you drink the good ganja tea whether
you do better or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Hawthorne Watson will look at the
scientific implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who's gonna tell us how we're
going to preserve the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Paul Burke, when he joins us,
will tell us about the farming
[SPEAKER_02]: implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Tony Versura, I will pronounce it
right, Tony, will look at the economic
[SPEAKER_02]: implications and the reference to Gary
Harriot, who talked about the biblical and
[SPEAKER_02]: moral implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know if you're religious,
it says the herbs, the good herbs,
[SPEAKER_02]: are for the healing of the nations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel a prayer up there, Reverend
Harriot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's gonna look at the moral and
biblical issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said to my friend, but why would he care
if we can't make money?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is wrong with us?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not smoking the good weed,
Dr. Delahaye.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're drinking it, we're making mental
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I can get over these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would he care?
[SPEAKER_02]: How could there possibly be some biblical
and moral issues related to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But he'll tell us, he'll explain it to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. William Corley, who was scheduled
to speak, will be replaced by Mr. Courtney
[SPEAKER_02]: Betty from Timeless Herbal Care that will
tell us about the medicinal tourism
[SPEAKER_02]: implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we get tourists in?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I looked at Sanjay Gupta on CNN,
and I looked at the various persons that
[SPEAKER_02]: were being, I think some kind of
palliative, relief from their epilepsy or
[SPEAKER_02]: serious pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably we could get people to come in,
Mr. Betty, to somewhere notorious or open
[SPEAKER_02]: a malady or near to a compound where they
have the cool breeze and everything is
[SPEAKER_02]: fine and we can just, we won't smoke it,
we'll just drink it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a pill, we'll eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are not issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we will discuss in this,
in this panel discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you, after that, after they have
given you the only, each person will spend
[SPEAKER_02]: five, 10 minutes, we want to have a
vibrancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to hear from you and you tell us
whether you agree with them and whether
[SPEAKER_02]: you have other perspectives that we can
look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me tell you a little bit about
our panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one that will be speaking is
Dr. Winston Delahaye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Winston Delahaye is an electrical in
psychiatry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a consultant psychiatrist and a
clinical director of the Addiction
[SPEAKER_02]: Treatment Services Unit at the University
Hospital of the West Indies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He completed his MD at the University of
Pets, Hungary.
[SPEAKER_02]: His postgraduate degree in psychiatry at
the University of the West Indies.
[SPEAKER_02]: His master's in public health,
specializing in substance abuse and mental
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the John Hopkins University and a
Fulbright-Huberts Humphrey Fellowship in
[SPEAKER_02]: substance abuse, education, prevention and
treatment at the John Hopkins University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find this particularly interesting that
he is the chairman of the Bellevue
[SPEAKER_02]: Hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think we're all gonna go loony,
he'll be able to talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can understand me and treat you,
but I don't think that's what he plans to
[SPEAKER_02]: say.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the deputy chairman of the Jamaican
National Council on Drug Abuse,
[SPEAKER_02]: chairman of the National Homeless
Committee, amongst other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and past president of the Jamaica
Psychiatric Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, help me to welcome
Dr. Winston Delahaye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, friends all, but thank the
organizers for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know too much about the format
and so on, but because I do these lectures
[SPEAKER_05]: every day at the university, it wasn't
difficult to get something together for
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a very important matter that we're
discussing here today, as a psychiatrist,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm affiliated with all aspects of
cannabis as an addiction psychiatrist,
[SPEAKER_05]: as a specialty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly see the other end of things
where persons who are not so lucky,
[SPEAKER_05]: as others are, succumb to the ill effects
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the same way, as the clinical
director of Medicando Limited and the
[SPEAKER_05]: chairman of that clinical committee,
I'm involved currently at a very advanced
[SPEAKER_05]: stage with clinical trials using cannabis
for treating a wide range of illnesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I certainly recognize the positive
effects of cannabis in terms of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: use for medicinal purposes and support
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the same breath, given my
specialty, I recognize the negatives and
[SPEAKER_05]: treat the patients, including a while ago,
which is when I was almost a youngster,
[SPEAKER_05]: only 16, with cannabis and new psychosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly am exposed to both ends and
have to share with you that aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been asked to comment on the effects
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you may or may not know,
persons who are pro-cannabis are more
[SPEAKER_05]: likely to be associated with what for them
are positive effects, which isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily on good balance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I certainly speak to all aspects
very briefly this evening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a lot of debate around the whole
issue of deep realization, which I'm also
[SPEAKER_05]: actively involved in, recognizing the
challenges that we face as a country in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of the management of any substance
related disorder.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I'll share with you the most
recent National School drug survey of
[SPEAKER_05]: November last year where, and this is
really alarming, so I've been with
[SPEAKER_05]: National Coastal Drug Abuse for the past
10 to 12 years, and I've seen the amount
[SPEAKER_05]: of work they've been doing in the last
five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has doubled, tripled in terms of
their efforts and the number of man-hours,
[SPEAKER_05]: for lack of a better word, that they have
put in educating youngsters in particular
[SPEAKER_05]: about drug use.
[SPEAKER_05]: In spite of that, in the last November
survey, 60 to 70% of youngsters reported
[SPEAKER_05]: not having heard a single word about a
prevention message.
[SPEAKER_05]: That clearly tells you that the funding
available for these messages is just not
[SPEAKER_05]: where it should be, and the National
Coastal Drug Abuse, in spite of its
[SPEAKER_05]: efforts, needs more resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do more to reach persons who may not
be as lucky as others are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm very happy, and I tell patients
who come to me, if you see positives in
[SPEAKER_05]: what you do, that's fine with me,
very happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the same breath, if you're
experiencing negatives, I'm able to
[SPEAKER_05]: identify them and help you along.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my talk isn't necessarily for our
audiences as it comes, as it arises.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Professor Lowe spoke to this
slide in terms of the number of years that
[SPEAKER_05]: internationally we're now seeing banjo
being used.
[SPEAKER_05]: That includes as an analgesic,
as an anti-inflammatory drug, as a
[SPEAKER_05]: spasmodic, and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Larger area, I'm pretty sure you've
covered this morning, probably use the
[SPEAKER_05]: exact slide I'm looking at, because we're
working together.
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is, at Medicons Unlimited,
we've determined that we'll start our
[SPEAKER_05]: clinical trials with pain-related
disorders, chronic malignant pain,
[SPEAKER_05]: post-operative pain, acute pain,
pain in the gynecological area,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Larger area for the potential to help
persons, that's why we're physicians,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we want to help people,
and the potential to help Americans do
[SPEAKER_05]: better with the illnesses that they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the socioeconomic development,
potential development, which others here
[SPEAKER_05]: are far more versed in, but I'll share
with you that globally, currently,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a 2.5 billion-year business,
that's a medicinal cannabis component that
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm discussing, and it's expected to be
doubled in the next three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so many developing countries like
ours, with economic challenges like ours,
[SPEAKER_05]: could use the industry to help grow their
economies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it all positive, and that's a
resounding no, and I'll just now real
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly share with you the negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the main psychoactive ingredient,
meaning the ingredient leading to the
[SPEAKER_05]: potential problems with cannabis that I
treat every day, is Deltanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deltanol and trans THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is to say, though we support
medicinal cannabis, and we recognize that
[SPEAKER_05]: Deltanol and trans THC is the main
psychoactive ingredient, we also recognize
[SPEAKER_05]: that where you separate the products and
use all of the cannabis for treatment,
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't work as effectively as when you
have all components present in the
[SPEAKER_05]: products that you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate and recognize that,
and so the attempt is to reduce the
[SPEAKER_05]: Deltanol and THC component to a tolerable
level in products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, in our clinical trials,
we therefore need to exclude persons with
[SPEAKER_05]: schizophrenia, because we recognize that
they will be the worst, potentially,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they're exposed to any amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all the challenges that we
have, in spite of that, the potential gain
[SPEAKER_05]: is far more than the loss, and so we
proceed and press along.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to look at the potential negatives,
I'll start with addiction to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: very well established, that 9% of adults
using cannabis may develop an addiction to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number increases significantly for
adolescents.
[SPEAKER_05]: For children, it's 50% of those,
and hence the focus of the National
[SPEAKER_05]: Council on Drug Abuse and Preventing Any
Drug Use, and in this case, we're
[SPEAKER_05]: discussing cannabis in adolescents,
because that's one in two, and if you have
[SPEAKER_05]: two children, it's like one of them can
both use, who may succumb to some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: negative effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we call the drug use
disorder, the cannabis use disorder,
[SPEAKER_05]: meaning the addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DSM-5, which is the Diagnostic
Statistical Manual of Mental Diseases,
[SPEAKER_05]: which we use as our binary, for lack of a
better word, for the illnesses that we
[SPEAKER_05]: treat and recognize, specific illnesses
associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DSM-5 came about in March of 2013,
and the illnesses they recognized include,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just list them for you, cannabis
intoxication, cannabis withdrawal,
[SPEAKER_05]: recognized, well established, I've had a
couple of patients with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the most common illness we see,
but it is present.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis intoxication in the liver room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually in my presentations, I have this
one highlighted in red, because people
[SPEAKER_05]: like specialty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see these patients every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder,
so people do get mad from smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabis can make you mad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be very clear about that,
in person, with an underlying
[SPEAKER_05]: vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just real quickly, because this is
so important, because we're unsure of the
[SPEAKER_05]: genes coded for psychiatric illnesses,
we cannot today, through genetic mapping,
[SPEAKER_05]: determine that you are at risk because I
found the gene in your system,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so you might not want to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not sure, and so you're taking a
chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sure that if you are mentally fit
today, but your cousin is schizophrenic,
[SPEAKER_05]: your mother is schizophrenic, your aunt is
schizophrenic, it is highly probable that
[SPEAKER_05]: you have the gene for psychosis,
and probably will succumb to using that
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: If today you're in Utech, or University of
West Indies, and double-disciplinary or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything you want to finish, you're not
going to upgrade, because we are clear on
[SPEAKER_05]: the impact of cannabis on memory and
learning, you can categorically state that
[SPEAKER_05]: you might not want to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to list some of the effects,
and I'll close with my most recent
[SPEAKER_05]: research with my team on cannabis on
memory, which the findings of,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was very alarming, the findings were
alarming to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the common physiological effects,
I'll just lift out a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: Decreased libido, constipation,
mild bronchial constriction, followed by a
[SPEAKER_05]: bronchial dilation, ataxia, and that is a
normal gait.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I used to be in the Army as a
military officer, as a medical officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could easily detect who was using
cannabis because of the gait.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to lift a few more, restlessness,
depersonalization, these are the psychotic
[SPEAKER_05]: features now, and these are features which
users of recreational cannabis enjoy,
[SPEAKER_05]: but to others it's an illness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depersonalization is where,
in other terms, you burn out a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: experience, where you're almost seeing
yourself in the world, but you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing yourself, if you follow what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Derealization, you feel unreal,
you don't feel you're apart of the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: panic reactions, paranoid ideation,
and of course, the main and most negative
[SPEAKER_05]: of the illness is the cannabis-induced
psychotic disorder, which unfortunately
[SPEAKER_05]: for some, presents as a huge psychotic
disorder,
[SPEAKER_05]: but some, and we don't know because we're
not clinicians, have to wait a long time,
[SPEAKER_05]: even with and after treatment,
still a psychotic disorder.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an unfortunate thing, and you never
know before if that will be you,
[SPEAKER_05]: so you're taking a chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll close now with cannabis and its
impact on neurocompetitive performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my most recent research to be
published shortly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at the impact of cannabis on
neurocompetitive performance of Jamaican
[SPEAKER_05]: adolescents.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a sample of youngsters in Jamaican
schools who smoked weed at least three
[SPEAKER_05]: spits per week.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a sample of youngsters who were not
re-users, and we confirmed that using
[SPEAKER_05]: testing and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at their performance in various
ways, and so learning can be broken down
[SPEAKER_05]: into a number of areas, not to get into
the intricacies of that, but the most
[SPEAKER_05]: important is that our findings show that
in all aspects that we looked at,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, that was almost alarming, so we know
there is impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we looked at 10 things we expected,
maybe six or seven would be impacted.
[SPEAKER_05]: All 10 were impacted negatively in terms
of learning by cannabis, so that's food
[SPEAKER_05]: for thought for our country.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all children, and we're not doing
very well in things like mathematics,
[SPEAKER_05]: English, and known throughout the
Caribbean and in Jamaica, and so with
[SPEAKER_05]: those kinds of challenges, and given the
monetary resources, or lack thereof,
[SPEAKER_05]: we really need to start back a little,
and though we recognize the potential gain
[SPEAKER_05]: from the medicinal cannabis, not move too
much ahead of ourselves, but keep it real,
[SPEAKER_05]: and ensure that should there be any
changes that we have with funds available
[SPEAKER_05]: to step up the prevention messages.
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I'm not so sure those funds
are available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Dr. Winston Delahaye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting, because all
Mardinger heard about how good cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: is, and how it helps dirty, but only that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, should we drink it, no, should we
drink it, or should we eat it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we rub it on our knees?
[SPEAKER_02]: That we can ask him in a little while,
but he did say that the main psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: element that affects you negatively,
am I correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is delta 9 THC, and the rest of us don't
know what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm correct, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I must tell you, that a man is coming
immediately after Dr. Winston Delahaye
[SPEAKER_02]: that will tell you something about delta
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna look at the scientific
implications of ganja, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: sensimila.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any help?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, is it really Jamaica's green
gold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nothing in life comes with it
being perfect, am I correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Prof. Low told me today that CBDs,
I need to explain all of what that means,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDs are more valuable than gold,
than an ounce of gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, good Lord, you're telling me
there are problems, but for all that
[SPEAKER_02]: money, I'm sure that there's some people
who are saying that, and he will look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the scientific implications of ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna ask Mr. Hawthorne Watson,
who is the acting executive director of
[SPEAKER_02]: the scientific research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna show you a scene he has said
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: The acting executive director of the
scientific research, he is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: persons, one of the persons who isolated
some critical compounds early in 1969.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lectured at the College of Arts,
Science and Technology, Nowutek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where among his several achievements,
he founded the chemical technology
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first to establish and publish
the structure of a unique compound found
[SPEAKER_02]: in minute quantities in a plant of
worldwide forensic and medicinal interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ganja, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawthorne?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us not deny the fact that ganja has
tremendous medicinal effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so excited to hear about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there's a whole long blurb about him
and his experience at Central,
[SPEAKER_02]: and his experience here, and his work on
science, technology, and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's hear it all again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say, Mr. Hawthorne Watson,
please, we invite you to speak to us now
[SPEAKER_02]: about the scientific implications of
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will speak as soon as I can get over the
part about ganja reduced in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you all soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told you all the lectures this
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I was going to give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scientists have yet to find a way to
make science and technology sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't be very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the scientific implications,
what we at SRC are really interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, Jamaica is known to have a high grade
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over these past years, they have been
dilution of the breed by various strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not species, which have been brought
into the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be interested in preserving the
original ganja, the original germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the moderator said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why we are
interested in preserving the original
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm is that science is very funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, you'll really find something,
and the next day, you'll find out is your
[SPEAKER_00]: savior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because though we vilify THC, and I'm not
making a case for THC, in a recent study,
[SPEAKER_00]: one out of Spain and one out of France,
it has been shown that THC suppresses the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of ganja cells in the liver and the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know whether 10 years down the
road, THC will take and THC will be a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any case, part of the mandate of the
scientific research council is to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: the original plant, whether it be ganja,
whether it be ackee, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the first things that we
will do with ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working, of course, with the University of
the West Indies, you heard from Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: Matlock this morning, about the wonderful
work that they are doing in identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: the different strength of ganja in
Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect of the science that we
are interested in, you heard mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: we isolated a new cannabinoid way back
sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was isolated and characterized,
so we know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no further work has been done on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because it's one of those components
in ganja that is presented to remind you
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember getting a ganja from the police
and a 50 pound of compressed ganja might
[SPEAKER_00]: give you less than a ounce of the stuff
that we isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are going to go back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at whether or not it
has any beneficial property, or if in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: it is harmful to mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes, we don't have the
charts of the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a slight difference
between one component and another that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you even take, say, THC,
there are two different THCs in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One with a certain feature going this way,
and one with the same feature going this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one which is going this way is a
psychoactive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one which is going that way has been
shown to have no psychoactive effect at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes features found in the
compound can influence the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that in the case of
cannabitriol, which is the one that we
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated, there are features present that
we just hope that we could have something
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to go through with clinical
trials with those who seem to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, first and nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the results are positive,
then we will move to human trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to take some time,
because the slow process, maybe here,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe here, can also be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very costly, but we believe that is
an avenue that should be pursued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at the same time, we isolated another
chukenaminol C21H30O4.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the molecular structure is,
but we don't know exactly how the thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: arranged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's a clean compound,
because the melting point is 107 to 108.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a very pure compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do now is go in back and
isolate the structure of that compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in much the same way as CBT,
we want to look at clinical trials with
[SPEAKER_00]: mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two aspects of study there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simultaneously, while we're going back
into the plan for these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are also going to look if there are
other compounds there that might be new
[SPEAKER_00]: and not so far known.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting, when I started
working at Ganja, the purpose for the
[SPEAKER_00]: research was that, at the time,
it was said that it is a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they say all that bad
things about her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female plant that gave you the
hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: True?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's face it, the female plant has more
of a resin than the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could distinguish physically what
they are, but what the government of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day wanted was the chemical
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you find the chemicals in there that
differentiate the male from the female?
[SPEAKER_00]: But before about six months into the
research, the government of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: changed its mind and just said,
Ganja is Ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you form with Ganja, male or female,
you get locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, by then, some very
interesting compounds started to appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the various talks this
morning, you'll see that there's a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: case there for nutraceuticals and
cosmeceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, there are several on the market,
and I know my visiting friends from the
[SPEAKER_00]: North do have samples of various
cannabinoid products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Lo, as you know, launched seven new
products the other day, and Dr. Lappert,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to his two asthma sol and
cannasol, is launching two others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fledgling industry, but we feel
that it has enormous potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we continue to look at developing
those cosmeceuticals and those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other area that we at SRC would be
concerned with is that we need to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: robust backup service in terms of
analytical support, because if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to establish an industry,
we have to establish an industry that can
[SPEAKER_00]: meet international standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't grow Ganja with money here in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can make two shillings,
but we don't want to make two shillings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make a couple pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the only way we're going to do that,
we have to export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we are going to export,
we have to make sure that it meets the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard that is required by the world
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, people are going to want to
know whether or not the Ganja they are
[SPEAKER_00]: importing has any insecticidal residue on
it, they want to know if it is soil
[SPEAKER_00]: residue on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think that we would hope from
SRC that we could do is to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis in that if you
bring your Ganja and you test it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be able to say this particular
sample of Ganja has X percent THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one area, again,
in which we are hoping that we can provide
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the industry will have enlarged
and unreal day, we can employ a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics and capabilities in our labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. Watson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next speaker is not unfamiliar to
anybody in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told you in my opening remarks that
in the good old days, when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was such a long time ago,
I told you that my parents shipped off my
[SPEAKER_02]: brother because he was fought with a knife
and they said, God, God is where they get
[SPEAKER_02]: into this rasta fear of Ganja smoking big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul Burke is one of those
visionaries, you know, who in the period
[SPEAKER_02]: that people did not find Ganja useful and
the thing to do, he believed in something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, when I think of Paul Burke,
I think of the phrase, vision is the art
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeing the impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because 20 years ago, you just couldn't
think that one day a group of nice middle
[SPEAKER_02]: class people would be sitting in the
Pegasus or wherever talking about Ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul started his campaign some time ago,
asking the Jamaican people to rally around
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of the decriminalization of Ganja
and the use of Ganja for medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said before, if we're going to do
this, we're gonna start with Ganja based
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we grow enough of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we need to synthesize it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we grow it, how will we grow it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the standards we must meet?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we gonna trace it from start to
finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we gonna do life cycle analysis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Paul Burke is gonna explain that to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna tell us the family implications
of a viable, productive, and profitable
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Paul Burke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, today's a strange day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never put my key in the ignition on a
car that's not started until this evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some inexplicable reason, it just
would not start.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a battery problem, so I have to
beg that you put it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I apologize for the delay.
[SPEAKER_04]: My, and it won't take more than a minute,
my, entry point was really about human
[SPEAKER_04]: rights first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing up in Rockport, I've just seen the
brutality being unleashed by members of
[SPEAKER_04]: the trade council after it was forced
against young people, young rasta parents,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the body of general, Bahamian Smith.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people seem to forget that up to 1972,
it was an 18-month fine theater sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a splice of Ganja seed, anything at
all, there was no discretion of the court.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, from that point of time,
we learned there was a cruel, wicked,
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible law putting young people's time
early into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm here.
