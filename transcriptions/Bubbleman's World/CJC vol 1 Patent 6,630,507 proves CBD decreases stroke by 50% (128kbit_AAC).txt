[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome to bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, here's where we dive into the
vibrant universe of cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tonight we're thrilled to introduce a
new segment, the cannabis journal club
[SPEAKER_01]: hosted by none other than Dr. David Allen
and myself, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Allen is not just any guest,
he's a retired cardiovascular and thoracic
[SPEAKER_01]: surgeon who has also served as a professor
specializing in the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: With his extensive background,
Dr. Allen brings a very unique perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: to the table enriched by his experience as
a veteran of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us as we explore the latest in
cannabis research policy and science with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. David Allen on the cannabis journal
club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome David.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning or good afternoon now,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hit them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, today we're going to be talking
about the mother of all cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give us, give us the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it a brief review of the
mother of all cannabis patents and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: entitled cannabinoids as antioxidants and
neuroprotectants patent number 6,630,507.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out in October 7th of 2003 and
we're reviewing patents and scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: articles about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we're reviewing patents is
because the patent office is the keeper of
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth because you can't make any
mistakes on a patent application and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent number assigned to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it in effect is the keeper of the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cannabis patent 6,630,507 came
out in October 7th of 2003 and was issued
[SPEAKER_00]: by the department of health and human
services, which means this is a United
[SPEAKER_00]: States patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it proves in this that it decreases
the size of a stroke by half or 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this patent proved this by doing an
experimental presentation on rats where
[SPEAKER_00]: they occluded a middle cerebral artery of
the rats for a time period and opened the
[SPEAKER_00]: artery and then looked at the brains
afterwards and found out that the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stroke was 50% smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's hard scientific evidence
that this works in an animal model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a sin that this has not
been tested in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2003 because everybody going to the
hospital with a stroke or heart attack
[SPEAKER_00]: might've had their mortality morbidity
improved by taking CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this proves in this that THC and CBD
both are efficacious in decreasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of a stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they prefer CBD of course,
because it doesn't fully bind to the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor and therefore it doesn't get you
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas THC does bind to the receptor and
gets you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would change your neurological
examination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD doesn't bind onto the CB1 receptor
very strongly and THC does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the comparable medication for the
reduction of stroke after these
[SPEAKER_01]: operations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember Dr. Brent Reynolds
telling me about tumor medications that
[SPEAKER_01]: shrink tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The maximum they shrink it is 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cause neuropathy in like 85% of the
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to stop taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this drug does billions of dollars in
profit annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, the comparable like
the apoptosis cannabinoids is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a comparable medication?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you say 50%, that's obviously
a massive number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe people aren't hearing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty profound from the heart
surgeon's perspective, no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk about oncologists
because they're the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was your question again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just whether there was a medication that
offered this lack of stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some other things,
vitamin C and other things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidants, but they don't generally
cross the blood brain barrier where CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and THC does and so has good penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this patent is based on the scientific
evidence that CBD and THC both stop
[SPEAKER_00]: reperfusion injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go into that in another segment
of our articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, when you stop blood flow to
an organ, the cells that are farthest away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the blood supply die first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the center of the stroke starts from
the very center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a surrounding area of
cells that are stunned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you return the blood flow to them,
they'll return.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still alive, but the center is
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the surrounding tissue is hindered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens in strokes is when you
restore the blood flow to an area that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been cut off from blood supply,
what happens is some chemical processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that make the stroke worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called reperfusion injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is when you put the blood
flow back to the area that's been denied
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and blood, what happens is there's
a massive release of a neurotransmitter
[SPEAKER_00]: called glutamate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does some harmful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is it causes calcium to go
into the cell, which kills the additional
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and makes the stroke worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called reperfusion injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my job as a heart surgeon to
prevent reperfusion injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I read this patent the first
time, it had some information that really
[SPEAKER_00]: changed my life as a heart surgeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says in here that CBD and THC,
I'm paraphrasing, can be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
Down syndrome, HIV, myocardial infarction,
[SPEAKER_00]: or treatment and prevention of
intraoperative or perioperative hypoxic
[SPEAKER_00]: insults that can leave permanent strokes,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And following open heart surgery requiring
heart lung bypass machines such as
[SPEAKER_00]: coronary artery bypass grafts,
CABG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read this right after 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew, wow, man, this is like a
miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't tell any of my fellow
doctors about this because it would out me
[SPEAKER_00]: as somebody that was promoting the
cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was afraid to even share this
with other doctors because it would affect
[SPEAKER_00]: my income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so- Maybe your freedom too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this information is actually hidden
in the literature because this scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: literature basically requires you to have
a biochemistry degree so you can interpret
[SPEAKER_00]: the gibberish that is in this patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 90% of the people that would read this
patent wouldn't know what they read unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they were told what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to interpret scientific jargon
into easily consumable language that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they get educated in this hidden
information, they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the world in a way that will make
this even more widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what our goal here is,
is to spread the information that's hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: in the scientific jargon and make it
easily consumable so you can tell your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can bet anybody is watching this,
if you ask your doctor or heart surgeon,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they know about this cannabis patent,
cannabinoids as antioxidants and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotectants, they won't have any idea
about its existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you will be able to teach your
doctors about this and this will change
[SPEAKER_00]: society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do a quick short breakdown on the
things that Dr. David Allen just broke
[SPEAKER_01]: down from this patent, you've got the
antioxidant properties, which cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: have been identified as having antioxidant
properties independent of NMDA receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonisms, making them potentially
useful in treating a variety of oxidation
[SPEAKER_01]: associated diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have neuroprotective applications,
which is the patent specifically notes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which Dr. David Allen just spoke about,
the potential of cannabinoids in limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: neurological damage post ischemic events
like stroke and in treatment,
[SPEAKER_01]: neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got the non-psychoactive
cannabinoids, which emphasizes the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: non-psychoactive cannabinoids like CBD for
their benefits without the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that come with high doses of THC,
thus avoiding toxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, the research and
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: This document includes data from
experiments showing that cannabinoids like
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD can act as potent antioxidants with
some efficacy superior to traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidants like ascorbate or
alpha-tocopherol.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain contexts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that kind of a good breakdown on
what we're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD, this patent proves that CBD is
safe in large doses, extremely large
[SPEAKER_00]: doses, even if you give it chronically,
it doesn't have any side effects to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't miss the major hypocrisy
of this being the US government,
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent stands out because it
acknowledges the medical potential of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis compounds while the plant itself
remains classified under restrictive legal
[SPEAKER_01]: categories in many, many regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's federally illegal almost throughout
the entire United States, except maybe in
[SPEAKER_01]: LV Musica's living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's exactly right.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our first episode of the Cannabis
Journal Club, we'll get a little smoother
[SPEAKER_01]: as we go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure out how Dr. David and I are
going to bounce off one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to continue to bring you
great information like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have information that you want us
to cover, you can reach out to me at
[SPEAKER_01]: bcbubbleman at icloud.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please, if you haven't already joined
to be a member for the Cannabis Journal
[SPEAKER_01]: Club, we're going to be doing question and
answers, and we're going to be doing shows
[SPEAKER_01]: at least weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone for tuning in and thank
you Dr. David Allen for sharing your
[SPEAKER_01]: wisdom with us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye for now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
