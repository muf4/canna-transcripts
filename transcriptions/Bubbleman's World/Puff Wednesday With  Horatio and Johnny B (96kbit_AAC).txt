[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up guys welcome to bubble
man's world hanging out with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Err fellow apparently they call me that
and We just got back from the Allard trial
[SPEAKER_03]: We were watching Zach Walsh actually a
friend of mine that I grew up with in
[SPEAKER_03]: Winnipeg testifying I guess he's a PhD now
or has a doctor Yeah, he's done some he
[SPEAKER_02]: done some studies like operative like some
large numbers Groups and and I was finding
[SPEAKER_02]: how the judge not the judge story the
crown was trying to fucking and he's not
[SPEAKER_02]: even crown They're gonna call them the
defendants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a dead dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really was a dick He was so trying to
discredit how kind of was therapeutic and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why I said priceless surprises I
found he was trying to just how are you
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to say that cannabis has no
therapeutic value?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what health candidate was
saying and over and the guy goes when we
[SPEAKER_02]: got 600 people doing this We got these
studies doing that he's like well Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if we look at the numbers and the
percentages Well, are you accurate with
[SPEAKER_02]: this it was it was it was the way he was
trying to do things that in my opinion it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like I feel the exact same way that it
was just He was just trying that he was
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this passive-aggressive thing where
he was trying desperately to get him to
[SPEAKER_03]: make a mistake to get him to say something
that he shouldn't be saying to get him to
[SPEAKER_03]: say a mistake and it just It just didn't
feel very I don't know I didn't Like it at
[SPEAKER_02]: all He was a dick and it wasn't the the
regular Prosecutor and when I'm the same
[SPEAKER_02]: product he's a defense lawyer right now
because we have health Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the federal government on trial
They're the defendants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are yeah the prosecute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the prosecutors We're prosecuting

in court I had my my man's right beside
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had mine You can see you can see
me with my mighty vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I still have it in here I love it
that people are being turned away for
[SPEAKER_02]: having their medicine But people like me
and mark who put it in containers that
[SPEAKER_02]: were airtight and were smellproof Had no
problem bringing their medicine in with
[SPEAKER_02]: them and go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are anywhere We want with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the mighty right there if you want
to pull out a nugget I'll pack it for you
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is you know what we're gonna
hit the hash right now telling you if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to hit a fucking awesome vaporizer It
really is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I happen to have some dogs on me guys
That's what I figured you would and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: got the hash so I can load us up a couple
of dabs while you're hashing and loading
[SPEAKER_03]: up a couple of mighties It's a pleasant
unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't recharged it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit it all day yesterday I started on
the mountain before on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hit it in the hot tub We took it up to
the mountain and we had it in the bike
[SPEAKER_03]: Park or sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep calling it the bike park.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how warm it is up in Whistler right
now up in the snowboard and ski park I
[SPEAKER_03]: know you don't smoke flowers, but I'll
vape some with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is smells great some cushy kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be the nanny This thing has a
hilarious It looks like a grinder and it
[SPEAKER_03]: breaks in half and then you put the bottom
half and you screw it into here And it
[SPEAKER_03]: makes this big circle and then you can
basically grind weed with your grinder And
[SPEAKER_03]: dump it right into this piece that it fits
perfect and then the center hole pulls out
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the weed Funnels into the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I it was quite a unique Little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I didn't use it and I'll tell you
why I didn't use it because I found the
[SPEAKER_03]: medtainer Just like this was perfect I'm
gonna say we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me help you out with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works very well on the original
volcano, too So I'd like to see that it
[SPEAKER_02]: works very well with the new mighty And
I'm definitely gonna be getting one a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already saw it I was over at a pox of
course, and they had just brought them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you hit it yet though?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit the small one, not the big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the mighty though, that's a different
unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the mighty.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had an app hooked up to his cell phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This goes onto the cell phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can click that on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at how quick that climbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But simple too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the battery too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two bars out of six and I used it all day
yesterday in the gondola on the hot tub in
[SPEAKER_03]: my truck on the top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it climbs nice and fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I had in the case today in
the Allard case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just passed that over to Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know my favorite number is 420,
but it's set for 393.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna load myself up a bowl here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a hatch everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just sitting in a lovely parking lot
over top of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drove in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a passenger in the car and I have
to say when I'm a passenger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sit with Steve here and I'm like we
can't park here so I backed off and parked
[SPEAKER_02]: in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pay very little attention to my
surroundings when I'm a passenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to just relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually seeing how long it
takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you dab or can you hit the good old
mighty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could start hitting vape hits right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hasn't reached full temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna go right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go not far behind you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks to you hitting this dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one bummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have put some water in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just find when you carry a dabber and
hash and med-tainers and weed and a bong
[SPEAKER_03]: bag and a bong and the nail and the dome
and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thirsty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well throw in a bottle of bong
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if I keep a bottle with just bong
water in it I won't drink the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could get yourself a bottle of
water that you can drink when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: thirsty and you could get another bottle
of water for your bong when you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: have rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying mighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a bong rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you it's a killer unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sold on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a huge straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gives wicked rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tastes superb.
[SPEAKER_00]: What hash were we hitting there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing like a really good puff down after
me sitting in court.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about it is you know
what it's being tweeted live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least there is some kind of footage
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tweeting away saying my little two
bits of what I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis culture too is the big media
outlet for cannabis that you can follow
[SPEAKER_03]: their Twitter accounts, follow their
Facebook and check them out on their live
[SPEAKER_03]: website.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're updating as we puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is just killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got such a good flavor from that last
rip on that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still tasting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's sure a nice, uh, it's perfect
that they waited this long to come out
[SPEAKER_02]: with the perfect unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice addition to a hash session.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's giving you those big tasty hash rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something to be said for
vaporizing big tasty rips of herb while
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, it's almost like,
uh, a full, full cycle all the way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the hash got me quite a ways
around, but this little bit of herb resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is still just hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, uh, I'm of course hot air extracting
with the little mighty unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So little mighty, you guys can check them
out at, uh, stores and Bickel,
[SPEAKER_03]: the volcano.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good people that brought you the volcano.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in Canada or even if you're not
in Canada, you can check out my buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_03]: At, uh, the puff wizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the puff wizard?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's the puff wizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always forget wizard puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always forget the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm such a punch punch in wizard puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's wizard puff.com and he sells
all sorts of cool vaporizers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll put his link in the, in the
comment section of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should load this thing up and
have something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm down for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I just bumped into Horatio.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had a nice lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I heard you were on the Adam Dunn
show today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the Adam Dunn show, uh,
from today.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to hear about terpenes Horatio
was in the group talking and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess now we're about to Johnny's a
little bit excited, like a kid in a candy
[SPEAKER_03]: store because, uh, well, look at me,
I'm running.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is finally getting his D nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered him up a Ninja and we're going
to go pick it up at the, at my office.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess let's jump into this car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny, Johnny B's got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the 280 kilometer car, eight speed
that you drive in North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm just happy to be, be a part.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got the fresh headies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go get Johnny B a D nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Angie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got two Javers in my hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two Javers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up Squish?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going down?
[SPEAKER_03]: How was Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm excited to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we got here for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pray this is his thing and this isn't
all just what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold that Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just taking it out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into the open area, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squish holds it down here at fresh
headies.
[SPEAKER_03]: She does not fuck around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to have some structure somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for John to open this thing
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I'll take that and I'll get Horatio
to open that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horatio is in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just, I think this is a thing I
ordered for John.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not, then it's something for me
and it'll be a funny video because John
[SPEAKER_03]: thinks it's for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, is this really happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the moment we've been waiting for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I've been waiting for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how upset you've been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically just bought one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got that D now back, so it was
just like, well, let's just get Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just for... Okay, let's see what we
got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so he mentioned these are for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you get one, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one he wanted to make sure I got,
which was a silver one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this, all built in ninja style.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your dabber, click, boom,
your power cable, which should also be
[SPEAKER_03]: right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right next to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Power cable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, you have a place to
put your bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what's really nice about
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Might fit your little yellow one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I think it'll fit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll fit it real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it got itself a home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting to put... Look,
it matches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... It's meant to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, John, there you go,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where John answers his phone while
we're filming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's dead to boot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's have a session with this bad
boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we made it to the fresh
Heddy's warehouse here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got bubble nails stacked up behind
us, hoodlum jackets over here,
[SPEAKER_03]: screens over here, and of course,
Johnny, you got your new D-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this exciting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny just opened this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you guys saw him open it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock yourself open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get it plugged up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, let him pick this up off the ground,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He even matched my D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it, Freddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still got a few more power buttons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that's step one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, let's turn it on.
All right, next step.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go, one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, plug this dabber in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's something cool about what we
got, John, here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things here, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: First things first is the new deep dish
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Brian was one of the guys that
helped design this unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a little piece for holding the
bar of the heater.
[SPEAKER_03]: This goes in, yeah, right like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: D-nail will be on the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the words?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you want to turn this on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll also most likely have to
turn this on, which will start giving you
[SPEAKER_03]: your temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: How this works is, this wraps along the
bottom like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got water in the bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this bong, I'll tell you a story
about this bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number one out of five Mike Fro
collaboration with Martin Bissell from
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruhr.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he actually signed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Signed number one of five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin and Fro, 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're giving this to me, too?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the quartz banger as well fits on
there on the deep dish banger,
[SPEAKER_03]: the quartz carved cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out, boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That fits perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell the beginning of heating up,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just cleaning off the element and
getting that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at 360 degrees so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's climbing so quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, how nice is the ninja nail?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I thought was really cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm looking at things and I said,
this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, it'd be cool if it was on
the siding ratio as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that would compromise a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why they didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was pulling this really also
softly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this ninjaed out for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do it right now because I
put this back in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this pulls right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like ninja style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some dabs ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horatio is hooking me up with something
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some MQ seven star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven star.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried the seven star yet,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try the seven star.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me you smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen John.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live resin?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had some live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said I smoked Horatio's live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it wasn't the live sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what I thought he was
saying earlier today.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there is no live sift out there that a
dude should be showing up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're 7'10'ing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 7'10'?
[SPEAKER_02]: 7'10'?
[SPEAKER_02]: When do I stop this thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that is a pretty cool... You don't
push it up, you let it... You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll get more of the dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was... I just went to put my
fingers there and I was like, how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you...
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you push it up and then,
yeah, you get more radiant heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it wasn't just quite going up
enough with the other
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm not supposed to go upside
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's enough, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it radiantly catches up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sitting a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always learning with the new tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a few times when I got different new
pieces from D-Nail, I would always...
[SPEAKER_03]: Even, well, for instance, when I put the
sapphire insert on my titanium nail and it
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't go right in and mine sat on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that became a tech that people
started using.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Brian said, you just did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, no, I didn't do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked you to grind down the middle part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that it fit flush with the edges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you did, it got wider and the
insert didn't fit anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just kind of a funny little...
Seven-star dab on the ninja.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the ruler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me move all this out of your way so
that you're not worried about your line,
[SPEAKER_03]: your whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is exciting, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to drop it right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's just nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watching it bubble and boil and melt like
that was a nice little addition,
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Melt video time for Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep Dish Banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: has like one of two of the Deep Dish
Bangers that are here in BC right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's a few more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Move this camera up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to get that a little bit
of... I remember I closed my eyes when I
[SPEAKER_02]: did that because someone did a video where
I said he didn't close the eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it in my eye in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I just... It was a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I learned from his video to close my
eyes while blowing inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you press that?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is already ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you get it from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pulled it out of here and I just pressed
it on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was like, where the hell did you
press that shit to have a long... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't have a long one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need some parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's press you up something real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks so cool on the fourth
Banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't get anything wrong,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just pick this one in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm going to be so lucky
to get my finger pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your finger pressed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's going to finger
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't doubt nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apply the pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a finger presser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, I just change the dabber to the
dab size I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It cleans real nice with the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, you can clean the residual that's
on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the dishes way below the neck
of the piece, which I got to say I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want this?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have many dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was super tasty and awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever hit a D-nail set
up to a big roux tube like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the first color section that
Martin Bissell had ever pulled.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had only blown clear glass before 2003
when he did this pipe with Mike Fro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep trying to load more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you do it to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because yours looked like a big slab of
frigging flesh and you were just lowering
[SPEAKER_01]: in the boom, so go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, let's go in for a nice little...
Yeah, let's get something a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so apparently Horatio wants to dab
the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's not too bad,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barely held onto the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the deep dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it in, hold it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it, take it, smoke it, clear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like doing a session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was ready, as soon as you inhale,
I'm ready to be like, so what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about that MK Ultra?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like the MKs you've tried?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a year since I've seen it and
now I can't even remember what that
[SPEAKER_01]: original...
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD Rene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to have a hit of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this one isn't the supreme liquid
melter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has an amazing head space that I
think that you will enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was already... I mean,
I haven't... I think I wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then we were together, we were talking
about... It was me and you talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that are really hard on the nail
and I was starting to nail the screens and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I wonder what that CBD strains
are like, because it's not a guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's going to be heavy on the sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with you being, you know, familiar
with Greg Gardner's stuff, everything he
[SPEAKER_01]: does is going to be the sticky version of
the strain when it comes to the turps.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that one of those ones that meets that
winter's day or is it a reasonable... I
[SPEAKER_03]: never really played around with this sift
too much, but it was fairly reasonable
[SPEAKER_03]: from what I got to play.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: John's in the background coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep Dish Banger Riffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a slow one, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have a lower melt quality on your
sift or on your bubble hash for that
[SPEAKER_03]: matter, there's just a period of time
where you're kind of waiting for the oils
[SPEAKER_03]: to heat up within and sort of press out,
which brings me up to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you hear these kids on Instagram are
taking buds and squishing them between
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment paper now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rose in the deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess it's a slow one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of a rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, this guy called Squishy Buds,
I think, was one of the first people to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, he's basically melting the resin
off of buds that are then coming to the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface and sticking to the parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny because they're getting
dabs off parchment just from squishing
[SPEAKER_03]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the bud, I saw it and I was like,
well, if we can do that in the grow room,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we could get wipes and just keep that
up, if it takes three plants to get a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: a personal everyday dab and he just keeps
wiping down the strain for like six years,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a double thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's like, I just got some fresh
buds and we're just gonna kill them and
[SPEAKER_01]: crush them, then I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my thumbs are so up for the perpetual
half-gram harvest per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a tech worth saving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the parchment wipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I talked to Matt and I know that he
knows compassion.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy who originally did the tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow that all over our table and onto our
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I would invite him into Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna get his email here in the
next day or two and I'll invite him into
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash Church as well as Squishy Buds from
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have a neat little discussion on
when he first started the process,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I remember it was legitimately to
milk non-melty resin glands that were
[SPEAKER_03]: thicker wax membranes and just melt those
oils out of them using this double boiler
[SPEAKER_03]: technique with boiling water in a glass
bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, that's those techs that
really help extend your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why when I first heard
them, I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing what?
[SPEAKER_01]: To bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crushing what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you throw out the perpetual
harvest and it's back into the forefront
[SPEAKER_01]: as a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to get in on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what I want to get in on is
giving you guys a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's all these rip trades where
everyone's trying to get the next man high
[SPEAKER_01]: on what they got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine is cool because I often give people
other people's hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so hung up on getting everyone to
try my own because I know it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is D420K's orangey diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be the best flavor of hash that we
can smoke during our session, I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well throw it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty nice the way that heats up the
quartz and just gets that whole dish nice
[SPEAKER_03]: and really hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting vapor style rip to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can basically throw like two grams of
hash in there and just let it smold and
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble away like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have like 10 people just keep hitting
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better than what I was saying,
you can do the best in how many dabs you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can throw two grams of melty hash in
there or a gram probably and you can just
[SPEAKER_02]: line people up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might even eventually suck clear domes
right into the neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that would be the most epic picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That rip that's like going so good and all
of a sudden you feel that moment where it
[SPEAKER_01]: flogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is the first of many sessions
I'm sure that we'll be doing on Johnny's
[SPEAKER_03]: D-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just gonna keep at it here guys
and we'll catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now back at my house in my office
and while we were at Fresh Heddy's,
[SPEAKER_03]: we came across something, didn't we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We came across this beast that you see
before us here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Ham Gravity Bomb from I'd say
2002, 2003, 2004, somewhere around that
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ham came up with this design, came to the
Cannabis Cup and it was actually the first
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Cup that anyone knocked out
almost as many people as we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was knocking people out left,
right and center.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was actually a guy that passed out
at Ham's table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hit it and then he passed out kind of
on Ham's table but then rolled over to the
[SPEAKER_03]: guy next to Ham's table and that guy just
had a ton of glass on his table and the
[SPEAKER_03]: dude passed out and rolled over his glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably broke like three or four pieces
in an instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is no fucking joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I was trying desperately to set it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna just see.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be one piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: One last chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my last chance right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can find this little piece that I may
or may not have and this is an adaptive
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm looking for right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This adapter, it turns, I think it goes
from an 18 to a 14 but I'm not gonna end
[SPEAKER_03]: up finding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm a pig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: My office is terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every door is just full of hash and glass
and then more hash and apparently that
piece is gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember a half of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a long time, unless it got put into
this top.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are all sorts of good things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one day I will do a video on
what's in your drawer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so what this is actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a 14 to 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the opposite of what we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this was 18 and this was 14,
we'd be in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get one of these for next time
because we want to be the first to set up
[SPEAKER_03]: the electrical nail in the gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that's not gonna stop us from
lighting up a piece of B-line or getting
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe a torch lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have your torch lighter up here,
Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, I came up here with
nothing but I brought my torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I'm gonna require is a
screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so yeah, let's get this thing a
shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the screen here in the top of the
bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a huge drop down on this bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a drop down, but the, you know,
the male piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bigger than what you normally see on
a bowl, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most of them are not that big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it's double size.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go for uber tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uber tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And big.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go for much bigger of a rip
than we normally would.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so yeah, we got that in there loaded
up with some New York City diesel from
[SPEAKER_03]: D420k.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess we're gonna need a little bit
of B-line, which is always close by.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of having the torch
nearby.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, let's do the torch just
because it'll ensure that the full,
[SPEAKER_03]: the full rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take the first rip just to show you
how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monster rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five times what we normally hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And crazy strong, super smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I'm gonna help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small one.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the whole point is showing you how big
of a hit you can take and how clean it is
[SPEAKER_03]: and how awesome it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely, oh yeah, if you put
more in there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ham gravity bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity bomb rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime you're ready, buddy, you can just
drop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get pretty good eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't even have to put your lips on
the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time most people do it, but how's
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was scared to drop it like how you did
because I'm not used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to be honest, as you do it often,
you sort of start getting it like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of got it at a bit of a bit of an
angle and you can, we've got it really
[SPEAKER_03]: full of water for a super awesome rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to take one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to take one more,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what else we can try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some CBD Renee from The Great
Gardener.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just like, it's a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, remember you can't do that,
John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's why I stopped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing about a gravity bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a good idea just to go up and
down with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause eventually what you'll do is you'll
break it or with this particular unit,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can't go down with the bowl on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a tiny little hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see it right through there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that little hole allows for when you
push down for the release of the air and
[SPEAKER_03]: for it to push the smoke up like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the bowl's on it, that hole is
plugged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the only place for the water
to come is up through the stem and out the
[SPEAKER_03]: top of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've definitely seen it done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That hit is now hitting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that unbelievable though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we just took like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually like, cause I was telling
Mark I wanted to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My back was killing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the best medical device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I medicate and I just got medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring this to the court room and
say, hey, judge, what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is eight grams of weed done in one
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do three of these a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about 24 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want one more brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to have some.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the CBD Renee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your CBD levels up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the thing right away that you
understand too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different ball game when you're
playing with the hand gravity ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not like a different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just like, I'm staying the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens after you have
meetings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll lower it for you over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ideally just put your lips above it,
but not right on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll, it'll, it comes out with
quite a force.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, does it ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have, you know, like you guys
watch us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always do bong rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always hitting it on a D and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like a crack it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old days we used to call them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was twice the size.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ham.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ham.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out Ham Waterworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for watching Bowie Man's World,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a good time today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk again soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you guys again soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we spoke Wednesday today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even know.
Have a good one, guys.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
