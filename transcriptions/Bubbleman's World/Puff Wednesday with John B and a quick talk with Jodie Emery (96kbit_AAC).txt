[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we just got to Cannabis
Culture, Mark Emory's Cannabis Culture
[SPEAKER_01]: headquarters, and we're gonna head on up
to check out Jeremiah and Jody and John
[SPEAKER_01]: and anyone else that's up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave's done an amazing job on the hallway
with the historical context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first level we have the Urb Museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an amazing place to come and check
out in Vancouver for full information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Sensible BC campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana man!
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Puffin Bowls?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working hard or hardly working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardly working.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's a band of misfits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marius, John, Jeremiah, and Jody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not troublemakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna throw the camera down and we're
gonna set the D-nail up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meta-setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are things going in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's about this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a good little thing to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a guy... It's gotta make you
happy when you extract those resins and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get to share them with people and
you're like, this is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do a show on Instagram for me or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I got like 400 followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find out who did the show,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone just shoved me out and I don't
know how many I got, but it was my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also didn't get to thank the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't know who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: My history moves too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happened with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we'll give Marius the honors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a remote control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You turned it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He turned it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a quick second where it goes
blank and then... Alright, so that's up to
[SPEAKER_01]: $2.85.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many Pelican cases.
Well, I know you're gonna smoke my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna smoke your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take mine and take one twice as big as
yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to take one three times
as big as mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I are very thankful to have our
resin and very happy to share it with one
[SPEAKER_01]: another at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna give some to Marius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marius is definitely in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any resin to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would like to actually share our resin
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not at that level yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make that choice and you make
that final decision, that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, $6.42.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah well, spice of life, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we did last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we actually made this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember once you made some of that on
the Alan Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showed everybody how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing people how to make a resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our hash video is the most popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's your vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're Mr. Boatman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the great gardener's sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite lovely indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always thought we should have an
Amsterdam-style university here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a technique to smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is all this dab etiquette and of
course rolling and hash meditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even really like opening a
compassion club or starting a company
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things would be courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be taking one day 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day there will be cannabinoid courses
that you take in medicine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll send me up and say,
did you not at one point in time fail John
[SPEAKER_01]: H.B.?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, meditation John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you fail him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get throwing that hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, and then I'd yell at him,
John, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting a big old dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, can I?
[SPEAKER_01]: He might need to, no you definitely don't
get into the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go for bubble vans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay my tender care then if you're
gonna advertise yourself like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let you dump yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put you to the moat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go in the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking with a friend yesterday
and once again I gave him a nice little
[SPEAKER_01]: rip on the pipe here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes the beeline, lights it and just
torches it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't pass the lead, the beeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well see, I realize now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you give a hit,
you just are happy to give the hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm with you, where sometimes you want
that person to experience more of your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, hit it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you just control.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that was sweet scum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, our rocker.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of the weirdest resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievably potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Shishkeberry Afghani Brass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It melts in bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no chemical smell or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like catnip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna hit the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of taking the first one this time,
I'm gonna give you the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next time we'll get pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: How not to put it in the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tasted Shishkeberry in a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first tasted this and realized
what it was I was tasting, I was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: darn excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys definitely, there's two
Shishkeberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a red line and a yellow line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what Afghani was used to
create that particular Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve had two lines back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I read is the red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the one that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so close.
It's brass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely brass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marius over here is so stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's laying right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went into blind mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just sat right down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for the last three years he's
coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went past for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I archived most of the back issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Marius has been in this culture for
10 or 12 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I met Mark around 1993.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1994, depending on when he opened MBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to come here and sell MBC stuff in
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were kind of the management of the hemp
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing hemp fiber and hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point we found these schools of
thread that were hemp and they were from
[SPEAKER_01]: the 30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found them in a warehouse in Manitoba,
like thousands of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time we were all excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the real weakness back then was
that people promoted hemp clothing as the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest natural fiber, but they would
sew the hemp fabric together with cotton
[SPEAKER_01]: thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hemp garments weren't really on
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, and they would stay together as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like the hypocrisy of the
original Mama Indica seeds treats or any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hemp seed treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using distilled, steamed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using inert seeds, which of
course removes all the medical properties
[SPEAKER_01]: or the health properties, all the
essential amino acids, all the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in there that you're eating and
promoting as a healthy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't sell live seed or even access
seed that was non-steamed to seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the original hemp seed treats
were basically out of the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea was there, I mean we should do
this, but the eating of them couldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered healthier than now when we're
eating live seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go to the Safeway and put it in a
bag of default hemp seed bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone got a barb?
[SPEAKER_01]: The barb is definitely more of a heavy
type of, you know, afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then shish kebari is an afghani cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like an afghani cross with an
afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is from D420K.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cleaned this resin and I believe
this is, I believe it was the,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the best grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He believes it was the best, it's all the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here in Vancouver, Mega Ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over on Kingsway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't open until two, so don't go
down until two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably look them up on Google,
Mega Ill, or check out the Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're just down at the BCMP
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hanging out on the top floor of the
vapor lounge with Marius and John,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's going to continue to get some
de-nail rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent Rocky a message on FB this morning
and he got back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also gonna talk a little bit with
Joanie before I leave here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get her to give an update on Mark's
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nearing the end of his five year
sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going on for seemingly long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longer than that here in our community
since they came to arrest the dragon Mark
[SPEAKER_01]: and Michelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll get her to tell us a little
bit about what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Bubble Man here with Jodie Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you, Jodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to stop in and just get Jodie to
give you guys a little update on Mark and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with him down in
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, yeah, just give us the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some people may have heard this is
the year of the prince's return to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark was extradited in May 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his early release date for good
behavior, 85% in five years, is July 9th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes four to six weeks after that
point for him to get home or maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure hope not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we expect is Mark should be back
by late August, maybe September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully not September.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely in the middle of this year
and we're past the six month countdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting very, very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long, strange, tumultuous
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's crazy to think that when Mark was
extradited, you know, Canada, we had a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of hope, you know, that we could defeat
Harper maybe with the federal election.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the United States, since he's
been down there, they've legalized it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: His prosecutor helped legalize it with our
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colorado, where Mark sent $10,000
to make medical legal long ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They planted the seeds of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overgrew the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Mark is going to come home,
leaving the United States, making
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legal, and Canada making all
plants completely illegal, except for the
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate companies that are going to be
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mark's going to come home to some
serious work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to sit back and relax,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good the way Adam Bowen wrote,
you know, Uncle Sam has ingested
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the form of Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to the belly of the beast and
overgrew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, they stole our prints
and things kind of got a little rough up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mark's coming home and we're going to
kick some conservative butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm definitely, I have not looked
forward to, I don't know, a party
[SPEAKER_01]: gathering celebration like the one that's
going to occur when Mark gets back for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's going to be quite a few
different parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that's some maybe rumors you
guys have heard, we're not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently prisoners who are Canadian
being sent back to Canada from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: are being sent through Detroit and
Windsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought Mark would be coming home
through Vancouver, getting through the
[SPEAKER_00]: airport I've traveled through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a friend of his who's being sent home,
his cellmate coming back to Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: is in that process and says he goes to
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, everyone out in Toronto might
get us first for a few days if Mark comes
[SPEAKER_00]: home through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone in D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: better get ready to make a quick trip out
to the border if that's going to be the
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there will be more than a few of
us over that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the big trek out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be great to see Mark
come home, a hero for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have a lot of work ahead,
so Mark deserves a good break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, we'll be getting him some
time off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not going to rest either in our
activism and efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sent him away, Harper and the
Conservatives sent him away, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make them pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely won't be letting them
forget any time soon, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for doing that little
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to see you, Bowman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for reminding people that
nothing's better than clean, fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: simple cannabis heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resident heads, what could be better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why spray butane?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, why spray butane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why spray butane, love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than that, I think Marius and John
and myself are just going to pop ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: into a mild coma while we wait for Maggie
to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit you with a moment of
fresh clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's getting over there?
The Chica Miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chica Miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chica Miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: The
[SPEAKER_02]: Chica Miss.
The Chica Miss.
The Chica Miss.
