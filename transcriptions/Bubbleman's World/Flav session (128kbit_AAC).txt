[SPEAKER_00]: It's just us.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's puff the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am over here with my good buddy Flav421.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always ridiculous glass in the very near
vicinity when Flav is in the house or even
[SPEAKER_00]: better when you're in Flav's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the options are more... For the last
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making the move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm leaving the lower mainland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were pretty much born here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Born and raised in Vancouver for the first
time in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many people in Vancouver are born in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I am no longer in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm moving out to the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting my four acres and a horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, well here we are in Flav's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass is flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash is flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rosin is flowing and we figured we'd
share a little dialogue with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot the shit while you guys are
visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were just talking about going to
Jamaica with our families and how fabulous
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get that going, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty excited about that actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to get that happening,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a little backup rip once
you've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got the one D-nail plugged in,
but I figured you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three pieces, one D-nail, two heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it work somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I think I might, yeah, let me go
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I want to really hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to come out nicely,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes out always very nicely when it's
warm, so I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so tell me about this little
cup piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is the Team Japan cup from
treating yourself, don't ask me what year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I think 2012, 2015,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little cup piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first Team Japan collab that
they did together in a slop cup other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the practice cup that they did that Marco
Renda had, that I think he actually no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer has anymore, but he did have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the one that was the competition
piece that was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Daisuke and Kondo and Roseroad's
Kajima.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were up against Carlson and I think
Delene and Aaron Syverson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Canada was Stratis and Corey and JT
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The detail on that is so insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dot work is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you guys could see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, I can take pictures and you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and actually, you know what,
actually, I'm going to go off camera for
[SPEAKER_01]: half a second because I'm just going to go
and get the accessories that came with
[SPEAKER_01]: this because, yeah, they're pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, you've got to see the accessories
for certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you one thing, I haven't hit a
ton of these cups, but I really love the
[SPEAKER_00]: way, truly, you're holding a cup in your
hand and you're sucking out of a straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's made of glass or not,
the feeling of holding a cup in a straw is
[SPEAKER_00]: so common and you're so used to it that
it's really quite a neat effect to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a really good grip while doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to give it up to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely did the most ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at this event and I walked by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some photos of these guys blowing
different components of the pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find them, I'll share them on
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a bit of a pain in the butt,
but yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: The stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well it's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call this, this is the perfect rosin
press because if we literally squeeze like
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 grams of rosin out right now,
you could pick it up with this flat part
[SPEAKER_00]: so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a paperweight and it has two... Go up
nice and close and then put your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: behind your other hand so it focuses in on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go close, close, close, block out the
whole screen and then the camera will grab
[SPEAKER_00]: it once I get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, that is beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them the stamp part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then the flip side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go pretty close to that lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, right up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so that's the paperweight or
rosin stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dabber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for doing that, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things that I always have to
do and it's so nice to be able to just sit
[SPEAKER_00]: here and puff a hole while my bro does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I really, really like this
piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, you want to give them an up close of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, what is this
bubble man puffing?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like one of the only pieces you
shouldn't... Here, get rid of me before
[SPEAKER_00]: you...
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to block out almost
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not clear though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be able to take your hand away now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I'm going to hit some of
that rosin right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little OG rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I still have some... I almost
thought I dropped my hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case you need more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's so many times that
you'll see a beautiful piece and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll take a hit out of it and be utterly
and completely disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name names or name
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really do appreciate a piece that
comes together as much in the function as
[SPEAKER_00]: it does in the artistic... Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I love about mothership,
actually, is that the function,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the scientific function of the pipes
are as on par as what people like to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about the... Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turned proto into art.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, that's just a proto
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, say that about any fab
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a proto piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, any time you saw that for the
first time, really your jaw hit the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were like, that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they come up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What brilliance did that come out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really can't deny that the function
is so great that even without the
[SPEAKER_00]: artistic...
[SPEAKER_00]: The function is the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When function becomes art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's taken the whole scientific thing
to another level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there were the certain toros that
are unique and one-off ones and ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are more work than others and this,
that, and the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with mothership, it's taken it to the
very next level where even the most basic
[SPEAKER_01]: production piece is also so artistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one that Bubz just grabbed is the
Dosa Kondo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the recently made, recently acquired.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a Dosa marble in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kondo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Kondo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is Dosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I posted the three pictures of
this on Instagram and people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did Kondo do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, because I never took a picture
of the marble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a little bit weak of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a Kondo marble infused in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when you start filming like
three hours after you start filming?
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a busy summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a busy summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only going to need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take this out of your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: FTK-ing?
[SPEAKER_00]: FTK-ing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's called the FKT.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of happening a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that is, I don't know if that's
passive aggressive or if it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had kids calling me out on my own feed
and I would post it being like FTK and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, actually, it's the FKT
because it's the fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Klein Taurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what actually though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, since this is the Taurus piece
and this is the Klein piece and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: fab, it's the fab Taurus Klein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically speaking, just people being
fucking... I think it's the Taurus fab
[SPEAKER_00]: Klein, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the TFK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this thing has a dish for a plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's literally, you could put
water in here and it would stay in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite deeper than it looks for as
small as the plate is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really beautiful piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the September shop for this month's
calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been puffing on because
someone tagged me into their photo of...
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone mentioned it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh fuck, I haven't hit you
in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get you back up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like, it's more than you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like driving a super car and
then you get in and you give it gas and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, holy shit, that went way
faster than I had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I should probably rip this
butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great way to exchange nails with that
drop-down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drop-down, if it was only for that,
it would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drop-down is a necessity to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, you know, I love
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're fantastically convenient
devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's ever sort of
sketched me out is the extra weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I mean, like a unit,
like this is really nice because there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't add an extra amount of weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drop-down keeps the heat source away
from the piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I usually personally,
I find that this is a little bit like
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll usually have my drop-down pieces
turned in almost as much as possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: much closer to my piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel, I do that with my Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring it really into, especially with
this particular nail, because it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about, of course,
the silicon carbide hybrid titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: From D-Nail, a wonderful little unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually ordered one two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my own little creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Enrico's Sublimator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the piece that actually fits this
silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So D-Nail had a very tiny, tiny little
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you wanted a real nice slow
dab and leave that thing on there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a super small gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took Enrico's piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put it on the little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll add a little Bob's this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob's is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's some pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's a 73 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any 73?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we going to end up seeing each
other in Jamaica for the Canvas Cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I mean, the plan is for that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes down to for me to go on this
wonderful little trip, I've got to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole fam down with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of making it all
work with the move and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd give it a good 80% possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which would be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll just rent a little house in
the grill or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, in the grill with all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the cannabis cup people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be super wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to do a Legends dinner this
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was asking me that the other,
I think about four or five days ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I obviously had no answer for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't imagine not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bring your residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: B-U-T full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitting some dabs, loving the glass as
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a pleasure to hit such beautiful
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am not sure that I've ever hit
that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have, I barely remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rarity to bring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've brought it out three times
since I acquired it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first possessor of it,
the other half of High Integrity Glass
[SPEAKER_01]: Art, he never brought it out really,
like twice maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I photographed it at his place once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, like a year and a half ago or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you guys have so much glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to remember, but I
definitely remember him putting this in my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab was so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chip on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to show the chip on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dabber alone has more work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Star of David-esque.
[SPEAKER_01]: Star of David-esque.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so, yeah.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave's like, I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dabber has more work than a lot of
pipes do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of full pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a really outstanding job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those Team Japan guys, they're... Top
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the quality of their work's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of who they are is even
greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unfortunate that I've never really
got to hang in a room with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I suspect that I let things like that
just occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it'll happen, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Yoshi will come back to Vancouver
at some point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, was he the one visiting Ro for a
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me he was like, I want to bring
Yoshi and his son over, but it never ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you were in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard not to be in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think I'm gearing up to plan
this winter's Whistler festivities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, New Year's again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was pretty fucking fabulous last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys didn't see it, go check it out
after this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what that video was
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it, Bubble Man, Whistler?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Whistler Fun with Friends,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Fun with Friends maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Gardener was there, DMAs,
Aaron with Wife and Child was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flav was there with Wife and Children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there with Wife and Children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had an absolute blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rented a beautiful house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what, go check out the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see, there's actually like five or
six videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snowmobiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snowmobiling was a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: The luge though?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the bob sled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend to anybody that wants to have
a fucking bob sled.
[SPEAKER_01]: How fast were we going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 100 kilometers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were saying it was like 4G's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that if we had started
farther up the track, it had accelerated
[SPEAKER_01]: to 5G's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, they don't even let you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people were being not very
conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too dangerous for the general
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fast and so incredible that you
can come to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to plan a Whistler trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't control who's in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys happen to be in Whistler,
you bump into us, we might avoid you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will turn the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm super baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to know which one to hit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the one that's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to have this little bit of
bubble hash here on the FTK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the FKT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the KTF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, this is the one you had in Amsterdam
where we had breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Krasnopolski on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was the daily driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just cruising around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss the cannabis cup in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going there for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a lot of cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the old days at the Pax party house
to the other when we ended up at that
[SPEAKER_00]: arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we ended up at that old hotel that
was like a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hotel arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was like an X.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a cyborg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was only one year they had the cup
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that was across the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the Cambodian Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year it was right across from the milk
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only had one lift to lift everyone up
to the third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took like hours to get everyone up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then simultaneously everyone wanted to
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took hours to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been to eight cups in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't claim to have been to them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like 26 or 27 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been to like 17 or 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is still pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunkman Sam and Rob, they've been to all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Amsterdam ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll miss it more than anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to go to Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that they'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have a hard time if they weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be insane if they didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to judge the legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately this year, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Michael Rich, our longtime friend
who passed away recently in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the founders of Legends of
Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll be celebrating him this year
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I remember someone said it a
couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it won't be long before you guys
are celebrating us old guys once we start
[SPEAKER_00]: passing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even remember when I heard them say that
I felt a weird feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, it's not a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: People die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the older they get, the more likely it
becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of the equation that you
can't avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's crazy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Death and taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, super fun coming and chilling and
seeing fucking glass with you and puffing
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to have some varieties of bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the different colors that you've got
there with your light and your much
[SPEAKER_00]: darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very greasy on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very tasty on both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of rosin I brought for
the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeezing out the hash rosin with the
D-nail press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I will be getting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I can't believe I didn't bring it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it out in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, we still might, who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll bring it in and Dave will get
pressing while I go grab myself a dynamite
[SPEAKER_00]: roll from Browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what's going to happen here
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, let's call it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for filming with me as always
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gotta take it out on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go Mandango.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rosin's so damn...
[SPEAKER_01]: stable you can just... Yeah, it's like,
just chip it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a pull it snap though, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little jump there, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a big dish, it's funny to miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
