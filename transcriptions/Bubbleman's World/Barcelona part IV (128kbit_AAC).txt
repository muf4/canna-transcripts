[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the Ibis Hotel, just less than a
block away from the Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're setting up here with Tony from
River Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing an interview with Noel
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just rolling up a spliff and the
sound man's lighting him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will all be part of the
documentary that we're filming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Noel Van Shajek, if you don't know who
he is, is a well-known Dutch activist who
[SPEAKER_02]: runs the Willie Wardle coffee shops in
Harlem.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing activism with cannabis for
longer than I've been involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's definitely what I would consider
a cannabis warrior.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're going to check it out today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, ready to go into isolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what kind of hash you got there,
Noel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Isolator, go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: From UK Exodus cheese grown in Spain in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now that's the right answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't smoke it, don't grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal favorite, if you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke it pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Werner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I told you guys lately how much I
love hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what this was, but it was
from Jim's and I love it.
I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before my career in coffee shops and in
the middle of my career of being a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis grower, I met a guy with a
restaurant in Harlem, I tell you,
[SPEAKER_04]: a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew him from a few of his
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day he asked me if I know a garden for
coffins or a job for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know an old guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does boat interiors and anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's able to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, so what, is the renovated or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, no, we have to take it apart and
make stresses for hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, he's not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, but I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we made a deal, but I was supposed to
get my money when I got back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, no, I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: have to make stresses for 400 kilos
according to the measurements he found in
from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the job and when it was finished and
I closed up the camp again, it went off to
[SPEAKER_04]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was supposed to be the end of the
job for me.
But in the end they called me over to
Morocco because nobody wanted to take the
camper apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had to get back together and fill
the stresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I flew over to Morocco, I was shitting
all over the place and we had to go back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the camper.
[SPEAKER_04]: We walked across the border from South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: We parked the camper there and we were all
set.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a garage with Renault border
patrol cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: They opened the back flaps and we were all
sitting down separately.
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of the customs, people were
watching them with dogs and everything and
[SPEAKER_04]: they couldn't find me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the night I went back to the gas
station where we were arrested and managed
[SPEAKER_04]: to get into the dustbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: 36 hours of shitting, no food.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're at Spanibus and we are
about to dab down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Seed Center representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanibus with famed hash maker Jibs from
the River Rock Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have him taking a large dab of
water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large dab of water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, Bubble Man here at
Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Philippe, a friend from France,
a bubble ambassador who stopped by the
[SPEAKER_02]: booth and talked a little bit on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's brought some of his treats to
show us for Bubble Man as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome man, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Huckleberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Huckleberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon Huckleberry Kush if you want to get
in on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually quite nicely cured,
very marshmallow-y and like crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out there Jibs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, these are the pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you decarboxylate this?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you have a particular
temperature that you do that at?
[SPEAKER_02]: 110.
[SPEAKER_02]: 110 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also brought a little of the
Amnesia 73 micron bubble hash and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've photographed it so we'll have some
macro photos to put in the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably do a little dab and a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to meet people from
around the world that are stoked on hash
[SPEAKER_02]: and excited to meet and share techniques
and share hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to dab up Jib?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Philippe having a dab?
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The D-Nail petered out on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't bring the inverter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only used a converter and we thought it
was going to be okay, but apparently not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are using a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you don't see me do every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, when in Rome or Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't touch that bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive you home.
Out
[SPEAKER_02]: the nose you get more the... The spicy...
Yeah, the turkeys are more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings tears to your eyes when you're
going up and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some strains make you sneeze too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to just keep the dab wrapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace,
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, bubble man here and we are hanging
out with the Sea Rippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a ton of people in the house and
we're basically checking out some of Sea
[SPEAKER_02]: Ripper's resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to take a little tour with
us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This here is Zombie Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent quality resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very impressed with the quality of this
resin and just the photo... It's really
[SPEAKER_02]: photogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of it, it's got that red,
red color to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, tell me that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this gentleman over here in the
marijuana is safer than alcohol has
[SPEAKER_02]: brought some really nice dry sift and he's
on the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: This gentleman wearing the marijuana is
safer than alcohol t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, beautiful hash and he's on the
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the dry sift group on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll definitely have to have a rip of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is David.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of David's just ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they say Fuego in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're here with Tony as well from River
Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his camera out shooting a little
bit of River Rock TV and a little bit for
[SPEAKER_02]: the documentary that we're shooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has just been the scene pretty
much everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked, awesome people with great amazing
hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash and all around killer vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep watching Bubble Man's World and
come by Spannibus and check us all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this zombie?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's zombie cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well that's just really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the zombie Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta say, they did a great job on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're looking at the resin,
you're looking at the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless you Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless Tony after the big rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're doing macro
photographs right now of the zombie Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: from Seed Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so beautiful and so photogenic,
even though it's dried already.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he somehow has managed to understand
is that if you don't touch it and bag it
[SPEAKER_02]: up and do all this kind of stupid shit,
your bud will forever be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the putting it in bags and
touching it and squeezing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back in the bag, out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of time and energy to grow
resin to give it to a plastic bag or a
[SPEAKER_02]: glass jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to know how he got turned on to water
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, his passion got him here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell also, it seems like the guy
that he got into herb when he was younger,
[SPEAKER_02]: he possibly had the best herb out of all
his friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like that, you know, I can say
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: At 22 he opened his first grow shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that, you know,
I met you at the Canvas Cup in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've met before, and I've seen Ripper
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, I never knew about Ripper
seeds, I never heard about Ripper seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to tell you all out there right
now, who do everything that these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: have shown me is beyond exceptional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fire bubble hash and incredible
quality bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to making hash with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good to be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually acknowledges
[SPEAKER_03]: that there is a difference in quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a strong opinion because it
relates to your experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I use it by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: He uses bubble wrap.
[SPEAKER_03]: He uses it in front of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: A square one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright,
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway, I know one thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some dry sifting together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you some techniques so you can
also have formal dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here with David, the seed ripper,
Jorge, and Luis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Canada, he's one of my boys from
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're having a great time and keep
watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: This man in this 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, Team DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always cool to meet new people
that are like seeing you on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_02]: are friends of friends, are in the
community, so connecting with good people
[SPEAKER_02]: is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fucking nice dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA, winning shit all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is original.
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 euros for 5 gallon 8-pack kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most expensive I've had.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next level down are the standards for
a 3-pack, 5-pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have Karulo, one of my
long-time bubble ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's explaining to a shop owner who
recently won the Catalonian cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_02]: first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to sell bubble bags and Karulo's
basically explaining to him about the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties and the prices, the levels of
different bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should go get some more bags from the
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on guys, tell us what you grew there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Original G13 crossed with the Neville's
Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the size of that nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, it is solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like all... That's from the Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: great job man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw this Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Figured you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A great gardener appreciates all herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, great job guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more cool people coming by and
talking to us, showing us cool herbs,
[SPEAKER_02]: showing us cool hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanavis 2014 is absolutely off the hook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally fucking cool event.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the cannabis scene and you're
thinking of a cannabis event to attend to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might want to check out Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
