[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going everyone welcome to
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back in my office at beautiful
British Columbia Freshly back from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup in Amsterdam the 26th annual
had an amazing time this year got to say I
[SPEAKER_00]: Hear a lot of people say bad things about
the cup every year and I have to say I
[SPEAKER_00]: just have mostly everything is good That I
have to say I met some great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some nice products these Generally
the whole cup is Like two parts for me I
[SPEAKER_00]: get this visiting friends that I haven't
seen in a long time And I also each year
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I make not a huge amount but a
couple of really key friends Key people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry that I meet and this year I
would have to say that those people were
[SPEAKER_00]: from the River River Rock Wellness Center
in Colorado Tony and Scott's crew down
[SPEAKER_00]: there Dane and Their amazing grower who I
didn't get to meet But I didn't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: sample his wares and of course jibs who is
their hatch maker who makes them just
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful water extraction All around it
was a really great experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really enjoyed hanging out with
those guys It was great to see the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: boys great to see Just everyone Horta lab
Medtainer John was right across the way
[SPEAKER_00]: from me that was always nice Generally I
have to say the cup was a good experience
[SPEAKER_00]: for me And I just wanted to share some of
my positive outcomes from it a few stories
[SPEAKER_00]: with you guys I really should start right
off the bat with before I went to the cup
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up hooking up with Brian and
Stevie from D nail and these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: great guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a really great product I know
they're not the originator, but what they
[SPEAKER_00]: have done is they've taken a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've making it that much better They're
extremely knowledgeable when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the engineering of their product and even
the thermodynamics of titanium versus
[SPEAKER_00]: Quartz and of course what I'm talking
about is the D nail I've got one right
[SPEAKER_00]: here on my desk beautiful zebra wood model
It's plugged into a titanium nail right
[SPEAKER_00]: now in the mothership, and it's up to
about 800 810 degrees And I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful variety of hashes out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to the guys at oil slick Thanks to
Lars who really kicked me down these parts
[SPEAKER_00]: Products via the guys from oil slicks And
you know it might be funny to think that a
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble guy might be using a product like
this But I got to say for for my for my
[SPEAKER_00]: full melt bubble shatter Stuff like this
is absolutely just you can't touch it you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't deal with it this stuff is a real
Solution I have to say I'll be taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of dabs of this on the D nail while
we talk and whatnot as well as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other varieties this is I Guess it's about
five years old Right now this is master
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for at least five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's like a red oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's shatter At the warmest touch
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard and then the minute you touch it
warm It does that see what I'm saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: warmth of your fingers is enough to get
this stuff to make a real mess So what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do is I'll use the skillet tool to
get it off And then we'll just leave that
[SPEAKER_00]: like that for when we take it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how sticky that stuff is right
there I'll be able to use a lighter to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the skillet tool off later, but with a
finger It just becomes a real mess But I
[SPEAKER_00]: can smell that wonderful master Kush smell
coming through loud and clear So we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: these on the oil pads We want to thank the
people at skillet tool for hooking us up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the tools to get our hash off our oil
slicks And then of course I also want to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank those guys for these little cool
balls and the little containers that they
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked me down The oil slick guys kicked
me down Right now I've got some OG bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush full melt in this one here,
and I've been cruising around town with it
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been quite convenient I more so than
I thought and then the little guy here
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some full melt dry sift that I
just made from some of John B's Medi Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag of trim that he left here a while
ago I ran it through my tumble now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I cleaned it up on a secondary screen
With my carding technique, and I made some
[SPEAKER_00]: real nice full melt dry sift So I think
I've mentioned most of the companies I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to mention I guess I'll give a
little shout out to Canine tubes with
[SPEAKER_00]: their little mini rig pendant rigs not
really a pendant, but it's definitely like
[SPEAKER_00]: a necklace rig It's got the little hole
for wearing around your neck, and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: the little educated nail in there with the
yeah nice little dome That's a cool little
[SPEAKER_00]: product right there for when you want to
get a nice little rip, and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a room for a big rig Also want to give a
shout out to trippy sticks Emilio you're
[SPEAKER_00]: all pleasure to hang out with at the
cannabis cup row always a pleasure Loving
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass vapor chambers the titanium
element with the deep ceramic dish a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more battery power than the
rest of the units It's why I stand behind
[SPEAKER_00]: trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why I sell these things because they
work for me on the regular basis Couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: piles of hash out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got baba and og one's 120 one's 90
micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about a quarter pound Beautiful
John B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuggets here can't remember the strain
might be many Kush I'll open that up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little later, but why don't we start with
hitting the D now through the mothership?
[SPEAKER_00]: using the skillet tool So let's see if I
can just oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah So we'll just take a little dab
off that it's transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the gold coloring in it I do
have a quartz bowl with this as well
[SPEAKER_00]: however I ended up leaving my 14
millimeter quartz bowl in Europe because I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get it clean more on that later
But I have an 18 quartz bowl here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only a Sheldon black and right now I
want to hit out of the mothership So let's
[SPEAKER_00]: dab the master Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably could have used a carb cap there
I Do find that when I use the skillet tool
[SPEAKER_00]: and I cover the little hole I can do a
little carving that way, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly carving the amount of air that I
suck in And not really keeping the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: from raising off the dish Really nice
flavor on that you probably noticed I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even cough it's and I have a sore
throat and a little bit of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cup cough The five-year cure there's
something to be said for it It did stay
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the fridge for about three years in
a wood box in a cold dark place and now I
[SPEAKER_00]: have it in the fridge not the freezer and
I allow it to breathe about once every
[SPEAKER_00]: month, but this stuff's going on Six years
old it's five plus years old and Just an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute I Can't even describe the
subtleties of the flavor that just came
[SPEAKER_00]: into my throat just now Yeah, just really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's satiating my whole throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up on my lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my throat and It's it's why you
sometimes want to cure your hash I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have you don't have to become religious
and cure all your hash all the time But
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sure nice to take half the hash that
you would Make and you know use it the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you love it and then try a little
experimenting so many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting with Changing the texture
with leaving moisture behind with all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other things Try curing your hash
for six months to a year to two years to
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you there's something to be
said for it Particularly water hash it
[SPEAKER_00]: removes this scratchy harsh feeling We
were talking to Aditya today from New
[SPEAKER_00]: Delhi in a chat room And I urge some of
you to come check out my tiny chat comm
[SPEAKER_00]: back We have different people at different
times today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a detail from India talking about
Melana cream the Kulu Valley the Himachal
[SPEAKER_00]: Pradesh area of these valleys Parvati
Valley and where some of the best hash is
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in India in these cut in these
areas And they have been for 800 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: years And he was just giving some great
knowledge from a from a first person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: been there Done that kind of thing lives
in the culture knows the people Talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the differences between smoking out
on the street to get high as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the spiritual Prayer of a chillum with the
sadhu sheep, you know praying to Shiva and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was all just really great information
So if you get a chance come check out that
[SPEAKER_00]: chat room I know I'm taking left rights
and and full 180 turns here But I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to talk to you guys from my office
and of course that master Kush didn't hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: things either So why don't we get back to
hitting some full melt dry sift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just made this today and curing in the in
the bag for some time left it open for
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably almost a full month got it really
dry You just you want dry material when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing dry sifting especially if
you're not using this dry ice method But
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using old archaic screening
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have dry material So we'll
scoop out a nice little rip of the full
[SPEAKER_00]: melt dry sift the holy grail of hash right
here As you can see I have piles of full
[SPEAKER_00]: melt bubble piles of even the shatter
bubble here that I have out on the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: slicks But you'll never really see huge
piles of this hopefully in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: right now not so here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a macro video of you guys so you
can see this particular dry sift melting
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it's a good 90 to 95 percent pure
heads it melts fairly nicely But the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the resin wasn't the highest
that it could be so it's got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a slower volcanic eruption to its melt
and I'll also show the master Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: five-year cured shatter bubble As well as
a bowl of the og and the bubba Because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just so enjoyable to smoke So let's
tell a funny story from the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_00]: this year Trying to come up with one I
guess I was the first booth searched by
[SPEAKER_00]: the police this year at the cannabis Cup
they came right to my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me there were rumors that we had
more than we were allowed Which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: laughable because we definitely didn't we
were comfortable in talking with the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: police They were polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't rude They just wanted us to
follow the simple rules as the police
[SPEAKER_00]: often do I saw a lot of people bashing on
it And it isn't something really you want
[SPEAKER_00]: at the cannabis cup, but at the same time
When the vibes aren't completely terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a unique position for us
maybe an American who's you know never
[SPEAKER_00]: been harassed By the police in a way that
you're not really harassed You they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just literally or do you have five grams
or more?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just have five grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice day I know some people are
complaining about it It's a bummer for
[SPEAKER_00]: seed companies that want to display their
cannabis's but you know, I think over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years many many people sold a lot of
cannabis at the cannabis cup and That in
[SPEAKER_00]: part was probably why now there's stricter
rules and they're watching things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that It does ruin it for the seed
companies that just wanted to show
[SPEAKER_00]: strength Of what they have in a nice big
cola bud But it is what it is and as
[SPEAKER_00]: things are opening up in some places they
may close up in others We still have
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have this ability to go there and
it's it's pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's Not comparable to what's
happening in Washington and Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: California right now But it's still a good
time and I hope that we can preserve it
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow it to continue to happen I've
been to the cannabis cup since 1995 that
[SPEAKER_00]: was my first cup at the Pax party house
and I just Feel that it's a unique event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five-day event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a two-day event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that Many people want to
complain about but yet if you make the
[SPEAKER_00]: best time about it There's you can really
go hit an incredible group of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to them and ask them questions in
regards to You know things that they may
[SPEAKER_00]: not have the time to answer you on social
media sites They do have the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer you in person at the cannabis cup
So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to speak at a panel this
year at the cannabis cup with Mike Carroll
[SPEAKER_00]: from California Scott from rear dankness
from Colorado and The DNA boys from
[SPEAKER_00]: California dash Amsterdam Danny Danko
hosted us and that was a really nice Time
[SPEAKER_00]: I've usually only spoke by myself on a few
occasions I'm not sure how many panels
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever spoken on but it was nice to
speak with those guys It was nice to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: what they had to say all knowledgeable in
their fields and it was nice to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit in with a group of growers and
breeders as Whatever my part was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the resin and talking about I guess
the end result of which We would be
[SPEAKER_00]: seeking the desired traits for breeding in
the first place the resin production
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profile and that sort of thing
So that was really nice and then I also
[SPEAKER_00]: got to speak on my own for just about an
hour I did my own talk on water extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry sifting and the endocannabinoid
system and the best way on Feeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and little bits of
quotes from dr. William Courtney and dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Allen to the doctors that have
Turned me on to a lot of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know about those such things So
that was really nice as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any drama like Ben drunkers
was able to create Power to Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spoke I guess on the last day at the
cannabis cup and he had his sensei Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: girls three or four girls go throughout
the audience and give away free cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess there was an undercover
police In the audience and so he tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop it from happening and I believe if
I'm not Correct me if I'm wrong Ben
[SPEAKER_00]: removed him by the collar of his jacket
from the room in which case a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: police tried to get in and some people in
the room sort of kept that from happening
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, but a Little bit of drama
when you're trying to give away good
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always something you were able to
do with the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's a little bit
disappointing but What can you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's still a good event,
you know, you get to see this unique group
[SPEAKER_00]: of people There's always fun concerts this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to meet James from loud seeds
It was nice to meet Beasel from Beasel
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts Always good to see Nickatee from
the essential soldiers crew the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: extract soldiers Heady heads his brother
James And the Gold Coast extract guys
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool to meet those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe repeating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the last dab of dry sift was
very wonderful Probably followed it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with an og Kush hit of the 120 right now
and Yeah, who else to thank, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many cool people that we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great I hope that you guys all come
by the fresh Heddy's booth next year
[SPEAKER_00]: legends of hash dinner Don't want to talk
about it too much because it's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: private sort of closed-door thing But you
guys know the gig the way to get a ticket
[SPEAKER_00]: to the legend is to bring your nicest
piece And show it to me at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cup at my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love wet wash We don't accept oil
entries Unfortunately as of now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrating legends of hash We did
celebrate a legend this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Lal Shabazz Kalandar He's
been sung in many songs as the breath of
[SPEAKER_00]: life You can read about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also posted about him and the famous
mausoleum that he's buried at in Where
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep these Hubble bubble pipes
burning these two-foot tall Hubble bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani pipes burning Day and night while
people dance in ecstasy At his gravesite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out Lal Shabazz Kalandar on my
Facebook page bubble man fresh Heddy's and
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read a little bit about him and
maybe we'll see you next year for a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: At the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to see some really exceptionally
well-made dry sift We love to see some
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptionally well-made water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for water hash that hasn't
buttered out You need to dry that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: proper and if you think you can do it on
parchment paper great If not, I urge you
[SPEAKER_00]: to use a food grade cardboard or even the
other day I was talking to Matt rise I
[SPEAKER_00]: know a lot of you guys bash on Matt and I
know he said some things in the community
[SPEAKER_00]: that he shouldn't have He does definitely
owe out some apologies But I like to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone together rather than separate and
I you know He I was asking him the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day what he uses as opposed to cardboard I
mean for the first time said something
[SPEAKER_00]: that to me not he for the first time but
someone for the first time replied With
[SPEAKER_00]: something that made us equal of a sense
which was a thick paper towel I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: under screen that he's drying the bubble
out on stretched Big nice stretched
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he's doing that, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still a desiccant that will still
wick the moisture out of the hash so Of
[SPEAKER_00]: course if you're doing something like that
to me, that's the equivalent of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the equivalent of getting something
done Which parchment paper absolutely does
[SPEAKER_00]: not maybe in a low humidity area,
but for sure not anywhere else so I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that and Yeah, I guess I'll have
another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rolled myself some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was the OG, but I guess we're
going bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great taste on the D nail bringing
me back full circle to the D nail because
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought them up Earlier wanting to shout
them out Stevie and Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done an exceptional job on this
product I really messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the first one to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged it in with a converter not an
inverter and We cranked it up all hot and
[SPEAKER_00]: we put it in front of a window with cold
air rushing in so we We really put that
[SPEAKER_00]: unit to the test and of course We pooched
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be sending it back to him and
he's going to open it up and check out You
[SPEAKER_00]: know what was done, but you have to
understand like no product could expect to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive that So when we got the second one
from them this one with the zebra wood I
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little worried I wasn't sure how it
was going to stand up Being set up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: step-down converter and running for 10
plus hours a day at the cannabis cup in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room That's not heated the room was cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm happy to say This is the unit I
brought to the cannabis cup Both whips
[SPEAKER_00]: from the other unit the one that was
plugged in and the one that wasn't plugged
[SPEAKER_00]: in the one that I pooched both work So
that was really cool and this unit worked
[SPEAKER_00]: flawlessly for 10 hours plus a day at the
cannabis cup for five days straight That's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep a consistent temperature for from
within You know the one degree or the two
[SPEAKER_00]: to three degrees it would move I always
knew when they had the door Open because
[SPEAKER_00]: it would move almost three degrees which
was a vast You know it was vast compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we were used to inside at our
hotel room, which was one degree So I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say enough about the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the lightweight cable cord that
they use It's it doesn't constantly knock
[SPEAKER_00]: over my bubble You know pull things off
the table Not pull over the bong because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real top-notch product I love
the quartz bowl the taste was Really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, but I also like the titanium bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hitting around 750 to 810 You
know, I don't have enough for experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with it to say I know which one I like the
best I do like that smoky rip But I do
[SPEAKER_00]: like that tasty rip and I like to meet
somewhere in the middle and it seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: around 800 degrees 780 degrees for me for
the bubble in the water water hash that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking So I guess I won't keep you
guys any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about A little bit about the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about some of the products
that I was happy to receive and happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: use Happy to put through the test Took a
couple of dabs with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll finish it off with a nice full
melt dry sift rip out of the D nail I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say enough about these mothership
pipes either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are can't wrap
their heads around how expensive they are
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems absurd for a clear glass pipe to
pay a thousand or two thousand dollars But
[SPEAKER_00]: we had the fab egg there and we had the
straight Fab there and they were pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much two of the most unique pipes in
Amsterdam the way they hit the consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: Saving of flavor through the filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I understand it but I really
got to give mothership two thumbs up and
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you're in Vancouver if you're
even online, I believe it's high Priority
[SPEAKER_00]: or high integrity high integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both two companies high integrity
is owned by a friend of mine and Here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver high integrity glass and he
specializes in mothership and you should
[SPEAKER_00]: go check him out and check out his
motherships This one came from him and
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the pipes you see flab 421 on
Instagram has also came from him and his
[SPEAKER_00]: company and you should go support them
because They really have a line on some
[SPEAKER_00]: killer glass Please check out us at fresh
headies calm and bubble bag calm come
[SPEAKER_00]: check out the chat room at tiny chat calm
backslash bubble man Fresh headies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in there usually once or twice a day
if you have any questions if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk chat puff come on down and I'm ready
to do it and Otherwise, I guess we will
[SPEAKER_00]: see you all next time Where we're going to
be hooking up with flat 421 and hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: his new Joel Peters I don't even know the
name of this pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some crazy, you know, honey dripping
It has a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cool pipe He's super excited,
which means it's over-the-top.
