growth coming in and signs of life
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, it's uh, it's so wild to
kind of be in a situation where The
[SPEAKER_06]: winter's over and people are kind of like
getting ready to you know, do do all this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff plant those seeds get The crops
going we got farmer Tom in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure he's been preparing Yes,
sir You've been on a cool little well,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you're probably not traveling
anymore But you were traveling for a while
[SPEAKER_06]: cruising around teaching the good word of
hemp Yeah, it's been going pretty well.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been doing these hemp 101 the good
the bad and the ugly we learned a lot last
[SPEAKER_20]: year What to do what not to do where the
bottlenecks were and just giving people
[SPEAKER_20]: good solid information Right now I'm in
Puerto Rico working with some farmers down
[SPEAKER_20]: here to help them in some different You
know hemp projects so and working with the
[SPEAKER_20]: local medical growers down here.
[SPEAKER_20]: They got a pretty robust medical System
down here in Puerto Rico And they've
[SPEAKER_20]: really embraced that they have you know,
all the doctors are recommending cannabis
[SPEAKER_20]: to patients Not just certain doctors and
it's good to see the enthusiasm down here
[SPEAKER_20]: about a medical program And they're so
excited about it and you know kind of
[SPEAKER_20]: reminds me of the good old days You know,
I mean first in Washington.
[SPEAKER_20]: They once legalization came the the toe
went sour And so what's going on?
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we're seeing and then Oregon was
all fired up So I spent a lot of time
[SPEAKER_20]: there, but they're kind of getting sour
and so Puerto Rico's everybody's still
[SPEAKER_20]: fired up It's keeping me fired up and as
far as the farm goes, you know We've got
[SPEAKER_20]: all of our seeds secured for the next two
years.
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got enough potting mix and seed
starter mix to get us through the next
[SPEAKER_20]: couple years and I just Got my ingredients
from concentrates Northwest in Portland
[SPEAKER_20]: secured those on Friday So I'm feeling
really comfortable about what's coming on
[SPEAKER_20]: and I'm looking forward to the future both
on my farm and down here in Puerto Rico
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I love that you're out there doing
that man I feel like a lot of farmers
[SPEAKER_06]: especially in the US right now need to
know what not to do almost as much as they
[SPEAKER_06]: need to know what To do I feel bad that
people are getting scammed out of shitty
[SPEAKER_06]: seed that they're growing and ending up
not fitting into the Regulations or it's
[SPEAKER_06]: just not the seed that was said that they
were supposed to grow and just sort of all
[SPEAKER_06]: this You know this pipe dream vibe that
just needs to be kind of put into context
[SPEAKER_06]: and hey listen This is this is hard work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be done if you do it right,
but you just see so many people You know
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially losing their shirts Making it
was devastating last year in southern
[SPEAKER_20]: Oregon a lot of these investors left Once
they found out about the weather and
[SPEAKER_20]: everything they left a bunch of these
farmers to fend for themselves So a lot of
[SPEAKER_20]: stuff rotted in the field and you know,
and they had a lot of mold down there Of
[SPEAKER_20]: course, it was the worst season.
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had and I don't know how long
hopefully this year.
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like to be a better year And I
just don't like to see people ripped off
[SPEAKER_20]: either, you know What we really teach is
how to bet these guys out How to do your
[SPEAKER_20]: due diligence how to ask the right
questions how to contact other farmers who
[SPEAKER_20]: have used these guys You want three C of
A's for C's to show they've done the
[SPEAKER_20]: proper beating practices and done their
due diligence So there's not
[SPEAKER_20]: hermaphrodites and that doesn't cause all
these issues You know, the only good thing
[SPEAKER_20]: about last year is it really?
[SPEAKER_20]: Kind of thinned out the riff-raff.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a horrible year Nobody's doing well
with it and it kind of got the people
[SPEAKER_20]: ready just for the money out of the game
and it kind Of you know real farmers
[SPEAKER_20]: weren't prepared and we take the
precaution.
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't pack our fields We allow for a
ventilation we allow all these things
[SPEAKER_20]: They're key components to having a
successful crop and farmers just are no
[SPEAKER_06]: strangers to Devastation like the way
money people are money money people hit
[SPEAKER_06]: devastation and they are gone Farmers hit
devastation and they start planting for
[SPEAKER_20]: next year Exactly, you know, you've
already done your due diligence in your
[SPEAKER_20]: field you prepared for the worst like we
do every year and we're and You know,
[SPEAKER_20]: we're and being a cannabis farmers and
cannabis people in general.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been talking about this a lot lately
We're used to adversity.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're like Gumby like man.
[SPEAKER_20]: We can get toward each way We'll figure
out a way, you know, and our motto is man.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's always work around for everything
out there So that's the message I'm
[SPEAKER_20]: putting out there for everybody think
outside the box look outside the bubble
[SPEAKER_20]: See how you can do it differently and go
get it Cannabis and hemp farmers were
[SPEAKER_06]: literally bred for this I mean farmers in
their own right have that aspect of you
[SPEAKER_06]: know understanding weather and terroir and
all of these things but then there's
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis farmers who also have had to deal
with Prohibition the police a lifetime of
[SPEAKER_06]: prison having your children taken away
having your dog shot Having your friends
[SPEAKER_06]: rat you out, you know all of these
different things that are just like yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no idea regular farmer guy What
cannabis farmer guy has been going through
[SPEAKER_06]: for the last like I don't know how many
years but Enough too long to count too
[SPEAKER_06]: long to count before your beard was long
and gray Exactly before I had a beard
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I keep trying just because I'm such
a tenacious person I thought I would try
[SPEAKER_06]: to stream this live on Facebook as well,
but it is also not working That's okay
[SPEAKER_06]: because we're recording this and it's
still gonna go up and it's sure better
[SPEAKER_06]: than nothing I know that the people in
chat right now are a little bit bummed out
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're unable to they're unable to
watch but hey at least we are able to
[SPEAKER_06]: gather and talk about this wonderful plant
that we love and For those of you that

with you guys that you're always available
[SPEAKER_06]: just to roll in and and and you know is
Are the women I know they're smarter,
[SPEAKER_06]: but are they also busier?
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely Sometimes most likely Did
anyone catch the subtle Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_06]: reference there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Debbie and Mark probably did.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah That sounds safe.
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that a Jimmy Cliff song?
[SPEAKER_22]: Originally maybe yeah men smart men smart
women smarter.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah Yeah, it's a Jimmy Cliff song.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's definitely a reggae tune.
[SPEAKER_21]: They didn't write it.
[SPEAKER_21]: No But they sure played it they sure did
It's a Harry Belafonte song.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Thank you that wisdom and we all learn
Harry Belafonte with Rasta Harry
[SPEAKER_06]: Belafonte, how you doing hemp guy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skunk Man Sam, mr.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amsterdam I'm doing fine except for the
microphone Is or the speakers coming out
[SPEAKER_09]: of my computer instead of my TV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I hate that Technical difficulties it
happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got a good group in here 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 of us Did this start
[SPEAKER_06]: a half an hour ago or you just?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have I've been I've been
recording for I don't know maybe 25
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes but we have not been able To go
live on YouTube unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
post it so people can watch it Hey Sam,
[SPEAKER_04]: how's your non THC CBD variety going?
[SPEAKER_09]: I Don't have a non THC CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were playing with one.
[SPEAKER_09]: No my Corona cure is THCP Of which you
have patented and it's now available to us
[SPEAKER_09]: right I've patented it several years ago
before they discovered THCP It's kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: what I figured I could I didn't think it
would take you long to have a kilo of it
[SPEAKER_04]: You know in pure heads, I wouldn't expect
him and his team not to You know Sam I
[SPEAKER_06]: thought the other day of a cool show idea
would be I mean I don't know how it would
[SPEAKER_06]: Work, you'd almost have to get Rick over
there or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have such an incredible collection
of cannabis Museum type things that it
[SPEAKER_06]: would be cool to go through just a small
amount of it one day like things that you
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to share You know and just have
someone like Rick on camera being like oh
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is you know you in the background
explaining it because for anyone that's
[SPEAKER_06]: ever been to Sam's house I mean he he
inevitably will always disappear off to
[SPEAKER_06]: this little back room and then come back
with something cool and it could just be
[SPEAKER_06]: anything It could be a silly DEA patch,
you know for a particular year against
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis growers or it could be you know
2,600 year old cannabis seeds from a grave
[SPEAKER_06]: site and Near some old tomb or something
but it's just neat stuff and he has an
[SPEAKER_06]: enormous amount of it and he has a Really
great knowledge on on what it all is be I
[SPEAKER_04]: think it would be a cool show Sam's Museum
I could totally see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean really if you could if you
could afford It you'd get that little,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, your little puppet there
actually turned into a puppet and he could
[SPEAKER_06]: do the whole show But that might be too
much investment of time and energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Can't believe On his what?
[SPEAKER_04]: On his patch collection alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's entertaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have 1250 different ones So if I
spent one minute on each one Would that
[SPEAKER_04]: take like half a day or something It would
be long I Tune in Absolutely Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually the one I really like are the
my favorite of your whole collection is
[SPEAKER_06]: the old Like like the what the hell are
they I guess they're like He's got like
[SPEAKER_06]: the Beaverland dams they're all like,
you know artists Those aren't patches
[SPEAKER_09]: though.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're water labels labels.
[SPEAKER_09]: The labels are my favorite underground
labels from illegal marijuana ounces in
[SPEAKER_09]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, those are amazing, dude I want to
show you guys everything within my reach
[SPEAKER_18]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, this is my
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want you to incriminate yourself
and tell us whether or not it's active or
[SPEAKER_06]: not Wow, come on we can really sign a
non-active bladder sheet the blotter sheet
[SPEAKER_09]: For ten bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure he would It must be some
anniversary right now of Owsley of bear
[SPEAKER_06]: because I keep seeing all these Bear
stories coming up every well there it's
[SPEAKER_06]: Owsley or whatever But is it like an
anniversary of his birth or death or some
[SPEAKER_06]: other crazy shit that he did recently?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen more on him in the last like
three or four days than I have in the last
[SPEAKER_04]: year Just an amazing cat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I got to run into him oddly
enough at a Debbie had us work one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Grateful Dead shows back more gathering
signatures for Jack back I think in 95 no
[SPEAKER_04]: no 1994 and yeah, just work in the booth
and up comes this cat and he's like you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to buy a buckle He started flashing
me for three grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what's that worth?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, oh, this is probably a
couple thousand dollars to you You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd sell a little more but you know,
you're with the you know, you're gathering
[SPEAKER_04]: signatures So and and I say who are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like I'm bear.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like, oh, I know who you are You
should ask for the violence pocket Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was we were way too big again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were gathering signatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we're working out in the lot
We did that but when we're inside we were
[SPEAKER_04]: serious about what we were doing and you
know, we had serious business Cups they
[SPEAKER_18]: used to have those orange sunshine guys
what a brotherhood of love guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah We ended up with a whole big big jar
of that here in Vancouver for a lot I bet
[SPEAKER_06]: you there's still a few left like That and
that was like 25 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just this big old bottle of orange
sunshine and it was it was you know Now
[SPEAKER_04]: was that the granulated was that the
granulated?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well the kind of like look like little was
a tiny little tab a tiny tiny tiny little
[SPEAKER_04]: micro dot Well, they used to have a friend
of mine back when I originally started
[SPEAKER_04]: with can back in 93 was this cat in
Berkeley and he moved into a abandoned
[SPEAKER_04]: house that house turned out to be the old
printing house for all the old posters and
[SPEAKER_04]: they left all the old plates and he
started trading the original Elas gas
[SPEAKER_04]: plates and all that for actual art and one
of the things he got one time was a time
[SPEAKER_04]: capsule of orange sunshine and purple haze
and We actually got to do that and try the
[SPEAKER_04]: real stuff, which was actually it was
granulated and you could crush it in
[SPEAKER_04]: between quarters and snort it and it would
onset within 15 minutes and It was
[SPEAKER_04]: probably the most amazing LSD I've ever
had in my life hands down I'm not sure the
[SPEAKER_09]: same people made that I'm the first time I
had any Osley acid was purple Osley that
[SPEAKER_09]: they were sweet little flatter tabs and it
was in the mid 60s That's what these were
[SPEAKER_04]: they were yeah They he bought the it was
probably a tan capsule from back then that
[SPEAKER_09]: was saved and he traded for original dead
art Yeah, and the sunshine was put out by
[SPEAKER_09]: the Brotherhood sands group and that was
Yeah, I still remember being at Altamont
[SPEAKER_09]: this the free stones concert and Some guys
were standing on top of a big school bus
[SPEAKER_09]: well psychedelic school bus and They had a
huge brown paper bag like from a grocery
[SPEAKER_09]: store Completely filled to the top with
orange sunshine and they were reaching in
[SPEAKER_09]: and the guys arms were completely coated
with orange To the audience handful after
[SPEAKER_06]: handful after handful after handful The
day the day the day the summer of love
[SPEAKER_06]: died no Altamont Damn that was heavy
vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you feel the heavy vibes Sam or were
you just tripping balls?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so tripped out I didn't know that
anything was bad happening until after we
[SPEAKER_09]: got home and people started telling me
Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's I was so high I didn't know
it was a bummer until somebody told me You
[SPEAKER_06]: can tell how much of a bummer it was by
just listening to the interview with Jerry
[SPEAKER_06]: Garcia right before like you could be like
I noticed that the music kept stopping the
[SPEAKER_09]: stones are playing and they kept stopping
and I would hear Mick say things like now
[SPEAKER_09]: stop that stop that or Whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that was when the angels were
murdering The the black guy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they put like they had some type
of a hit on Mick Jagger for a little while
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't they weren't they kind of upset
with him about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Kevin Keith Wow Well, I'm I can't you
know what Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of blows my mind that you
were just everywhere Like I just like of
[SPEAKER_06]: course you were at Altamont.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still am everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true Isn't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're here right now on hash church That
is quite a story, you know, we got we got
[SPEAKER_06]: lucky to up here because Nick obviously I
don't know if he got in trouble Down in
[SPEAKER_06]: the States sands, but he did end up here
in Vancouver He did he did end up getting
[SPEAKER_06]: in trouble up here him and his partner
Peter built a very big lab that was
[SPEAKER_06]: producing DMT and MDMA and LSD crystal and
the whole nine yards It was it was pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy in the 90s the lab that those guys
produced in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it made our city extremely
psychedelic and I will say that it's It
[SPEAKER_06]: changed drastically when that lab got
closed it Took a few years, but that whole
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that that lab was the production
of psychedelics for Canada and it was the
[SPEAKER_06]: epicenter of Vancouver and it was
incredible I mean you could just buy grams
[SPEAKER_06]: of crystal LSD for like, you know 8,000
bucks or whatever to get yourself like I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know whatever I think it was 10,000
or hits or something but pretty crazy that
[SPEAKER_06]: those guys just did that and I I thank
them for it because It was a lot less
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol people were consuming and it was a
very different frequency and vibration
[SPEAKER_06]: that people were experiencing Thanks to
the to the psychedelics that that lab
[SPEAKER_06]: produced and they meant business those
guys they took shit seriously They did not
[SPEAKER_06]: put out bad drugs if it was LSD it was LSD
if it was MDMA it was actually MDMA I
[SPEAKER_06]: remember because MDMA when they made it
was a four-hour experience and when that
[SPEAKER_06]: lab closed and people started Doing it
with other molecules that were more
[SPEAKER_06]: accessible with easier precursors or
whatever it was It was like 10 hours long
[SPEAKER_06]: and people were you know, like just on it
was bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just not the same thing as As as
what those guys were doing so props not
[SPEAKER_04]: not the same as good drugs is what we're
Well, I mean just accurate drugs I guess
[SPEAKER_06]: good drugs from a chemist from a chemist
standpoint is purity and accuracy like is
[SPEAKER_09]: The molecule when Osley was first perhaps
he put a little methamphetamine speed in
[SPEAKER_09]: with them to pick you up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh Yeah, well I wasn't there for that
absolutely true So I'm sure orange
[SPEAKER_01]: sunshine barrels had a little bit of speed
in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they didn't that's not true Which ones
had it?
[SPEAKER_09]: They were Osley acid not the sunshine by
the brotherhood it was Osley acid because
[SPEAKER_09]: he somehow for some reason thought that it
made it better You know, he was one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: people kind of like you Sam you and Osley
are the two similarities when I started
[SPEAKER_06]: bubble bags I had two somewhat abrasive
characters contact me via email at first I
[SPEAKER_06]: was just like I knew who you were right
away because you were like You wrote me
[SPEAKER_06]: like this short email.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like if it don't bubble it ain't
worth the trouble Do you know who's first
[SPEAKER_06]: said that something like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was just like this is a weird email
in the night I can't remember what your
[SPEAKER_06]: email was at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might have even been snow It wasn't
skunk man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some other I was like is this
fucking so is this who I think it is and
[SPEAKER_06]: And Osley was another character who hit me
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, yeah bubble bags a like I
like butter better I like putting my resin
[SPEAKER_06]: into butter and then he's like I started a
dialogue With him over bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up sending him a set when he was
living I guess in Australia Is that where
[SPEAKER_06]: he finished his life?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he in Australia?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's correct Yeah, so that was that
was like the late 90s early 2000s that I
[SPEAKER_06]: sent him some bags and he just couldn't
acknowledge that it was he was kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: like Yeah, you know It's okay,
but I just took it all and put it into
[SPEAKER_06]: butter I'm like butter like isn't fat like
animal fat you took that Hash that you
[SPEAKER_06]: made and you put it into animal fat I was
like, bro I wish you could have just
[SPEAKER_06]: puffed a bowl of it before you did that to
each their own big on the meat diet,
[SPEAKER_22]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he was huge on the meat diet,
dude.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was like Pro-meat all the way.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_22]: Have I ever told the story about like when
I met when I met there I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought maybe I said that on hash
charts.
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah Crazy what you remember so I
defended my PhD degree dissertation on a
[SPEAKER_22]: Wednesday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was March the 18th 1992 and March the
20th a day and a half later we were in
[SPEAKER_22]: Hamilton, Ontario at the Grateful Dead
show and So a friend of mine was actually
[SPEAKER_22]: having an affair with bear at the time and
she came up to me during Darkstar so if I
[SPEAKER_22]: remember correctly Darkstar it went into
space and Darkstar I was really high I was
[SPEAKER_22]: just really not in the mood to interact
with anybody and she said come with me
[SPEAKER_22]: You're gonna we're gonna go meet bear and
I'm like, oh, okay You know, so I was led
[SPEAKER_22]: through a crowd of people and she had a
laminate So she was able to get me back
[SPEAKER_22]: Backstage and I was literally on the side
of the arena and the band walked right in
[SPEAKER_22]: front of me Like Jerry was like right
there like right in front of me like as
[SPEAKER_22]: close as I am to my computer, you know I'm
just like starstruck.
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't know what to say and bear was
over the side stage and he had his belt
[SPEAKER_22]: buckle thing and a flashlight and he was
shining his flashlight on belt buckles
[SPEAKER_22]: trying to talk somebody into buying it and
So eventually I went over there and was
[SPEAKER_22]: sort of his next person to talk to and so
this was during the drums portion now
[SPEAKER_22]: because the drummers were just on stage
and The first thing he said when I walked
[SPEAKER_22]: up to him is he Grabbed me in the gut and
he said you need to go to the gym pal Grab
[SPEAKER_22]: my beer belly and pinch my gut and then my
friend Sharon introduced us and said This
[SPEAKER_22]: is my friend mark.
[SPEAKER_22]: He just got his PhD in chemistry You
should talk with bear and so it was cool
[SPEAKER_22]: because my first discussion of chemistry
outside of my PhD dissertation defense
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I slept the entire next day
Thursday then Friday we drove the Temple
[SPEAKER_22]: was with bear backstage at a Grateful Dead
show and we talked from the drums portion
[SPEAKER_22]: through the end of the show Through
everybody leaving the arena.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we were the last two people in the
arena and just still talking about
[SPEAKER_22]: chemistry and acid and just talking about
all kinds of things and he was just an
[SPEAKER_22]: amazing dude and just yeah, I had
basically about two or three hour
[SPEAKER_22]: conversation with him at a Grateful Dead
show backstage and We were the only two
[SPEAKER_22]: people in the building by the end of the
conversation It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just it was just such a wild
conversation if I could only had a
[SPEAKER_22]: Recorder and record like what we talked
about but we talked about everything
[SPEAKER_22]: having to do with chemistry about having
to do with psychedelics But having to do
[SPEAKER_22]: extraction chemical modification the early
days He referenced other people.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think he maybe talked about Nick.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure exactly Put thing and again,
I was super super high at the time.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was just That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I said that once before and hash
church, but yeah, that's like I it was my
[SPEAKER_22]: crate my first interaction with chemistry
as a PhD This was better Couldn't be any
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on That's beyond epic dog.
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that so cool?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like totally Full-circle because
again, I was just a spun-out kid on
[SPEAKER_22]: Grateful Dead tour in the 80s You know,
like most kids just you know, wow,
[SPEAKER_22]: this band is like Again, I had said this
before on hash church You can go to like a
[SPEAKER_22]: Neil Young show or an almond brother show
and you get hassled if you had a
[SPEAKER_22]: one-hitter at a dead show you can just
blatantly just blaze out in the open and
[SPEAKER_22]: it was just it was so cool because Again,
like my friend G chem dog Who tells a
[SPEAKER_22]: story?
[SPEAKER_22]: For most of us who lived in the Northeast
United States, we really didn't have
[SPEAKER_22]: access to really kind bud like you go into
Manhattan and you get this little manila
[SPEAKER_22]: envelope full of mostly seeds and stems
and it was like 40 bucks, you know from
[SPEAKER_22]: the same guy you get a bottle of coke from
you know, But you know, that's like the
[SPEAKER_22]: extent of weed in Manhattan in like the
you know mid to late 80s so when the dead
[SPEAKER_22]: came to town, they just brought great
genetics from NorCal and Just tons of just
[SPEAKER_22]: great weed and so so we knew it was kind
of like the cannabis Smell was the
[SPEAKER_22]: Grateful Dead show smell to me You know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_22]: Like it just it became like it was so just
conditioned to me like really good weed
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah, that's like a dead show like
skunky weed and weed that smells like dog
[SPEAKER_22]: poo and Right, right.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey Kevin, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_16]: Again you're out of Purgatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually aren't live right now We're
recording the show but I couldn't get zoom
[SPEAKER_06]: to work because I'm guessing the entire
world is doing zoom Those were great
[SPEAKER_06]: Grateful Dead stories man, I'll tell you
you definitely If you want to see the most
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis smoke you've ever seen at a
concert For me it was and I was there with
[SPEAKER_06]: skunk man Sam and his wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in that grill Jamaica at one of Bob
Marley's birthday bash concerts and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: I Have video footage of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The audience legitimately looks like
they're on fire There's just billows of
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke coming you keep in mind too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when people smoke in Jamaica,
they don't pass joints everywhere Everyone
[SPEAKER_06]: has their own joint So where you might
have three or four people together at a
[SPEAKER_06]: fish or a dead concert sharing a joint at
a at a reggae concert in Jamaica The joint
[SPEAKER_06]: is four times bigger and nobody's sharing
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just your own joint It was you
remember that Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely It was impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I Enjoy Jamaican concerts yard concerts
mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah yard concerts again Exactly just good
vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I you know, a lot of musicians have been
playing free concerts lately including
[SPEAKER_06]: Neil Young If you're not a part of it,
you can go to Neil Young archives comm
[SPEAKER_06]: cost about 20 bucks I got on there for the
pre-sale tickets that he gives you when he
[SPEAKER_06]: does a concert He'll let you buy them like
a about a week before and you get some
[SPEAKER_06]: really great seats But also all of Neil's
entire catalog of music is on Neil Young
[SPEAKER_06]: archives comm and it's all of the highest
caliber quality music.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not some bunk Bullshit mp3s Neil's
obsessed with quality and with with proper
[SPEAKER_06]: music, but him and his wife have been
doing these fireside Concert series and he
[SPEAKER_06]: started it out in his like the backyard of
his ranch with his guitar and his
[SPEAKER_06]: harmonica Then he ends up inside sitting
next to the fireplace and he does,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know some harmonica some guitar some
piano just short concerts 20 to 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: long, but absolutely incredible and very
unique to be able to see that with Neil
[SPEAKER_06]: Clinton Fearon the bassist from the
gladiators who's been doing his own music
[SPEAKER_06]: for 25 plus years he did one the other day
that I posted as well and I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot more that you guys probably know of
as well that have been doing these live
[SPEAKER_06]: Concerts during our self isolation time.
[SPEAKER_16]: I Think Ray Anastasia has been doing some
quarantine as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen them not live But I've
definitely seen a lot of them in his
[SPEAKER_06]: living room.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_22]: He's released like two songs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just playing And Mike Mike's been
doing some bass lessons and some theory
[SPEAKER_15]: lessons on his channel as well So if any
you guys are our fans of his bass playing
[SPEAKER_22]: you can go check that out Hey regarding
the COVID virus and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_22]: I shared this link with Sam and with
Marcus I'm gonna I'm gonna put it in the
[SPEAKER_22]: chat Obviously not now, but when you guys
get a chance check out this YouTube video
[SPEAKER_22]: from this guy over at Hebrew University
who talks about the Recovery phase from
[SPEAKER_22]: kovat and how cannabis indica
quote-unquote can be useful Talk about
[SPEAKER_22]: that mark Yeah, check this out though.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean I again I I was actually in the
middle of watching this when the episode
[SPEAKER_22]: started So I want to give this guy a full
listen to before I completely discount
[SPEAKER_22]: what he's saying But do you know this dude
at all Kevin?
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't I haven't seen the paper yet,
but I have been digging through that
[SPEAKER_16]: literature and it's the the lung fibrosis
seems to be very interesting Where it may
[SPEAKER_16]: be reducing lung fibrosis maybe in
recovery?
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the viral load stuff's kind
of all over the map.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some positive results although
very and very small studies with HCV,
[SPEAKER_16]: but it doesn't work with HPV and then I
think someone published a paper showing
[SPEAKER_16]: that in THC and mice it can make it worse
so Yeah, it's kind of it's murky.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's murky information, but I don't know
that there's reason to suggest people get
[SPEAKER_16]: off their cannabinoids right now It seems
to be a little bit premature and could be
[SPEAKER_22]: risky depending on people's condition
Yeah, absolutely because in general
[SPEAKER_22]: doesn't it just sort of boost your your
you know your immune system in general
[SPEAKER_22]: because of its CB2 activity and just sort
of act as sort of like a peripheral
[SPEAKER_22]: anti-inflammatory Agent that would help
with fever or any other symptoms that
[SPEAKER_22]: could come along with getting any virus
I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been told to say that a lot when it
comes to this stuff But what I've read is
[SPEAKER_16]: it's an immune modulator So if your immune
system is down it brings it up if it's
[SPEAKER_16]: cytokine if it's in a cytokine storm it
brings it down That's probably the most
[SPEAKER_16]: important feature because the cytokine
storms were killing people with kovat You
[SPEAKER_16]: know that the viral loads are going down
in the storms are going up which is A sign
[SPEAKER_16]: that your immune system is already dealing
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but yeah The dragonfly earth
medicine family and bubble man hosted a
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar a couple of days ago with a few
doctors On board talking about this very
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very informative and very upbeat
There's a couple of Out there moments,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the link on it I don't know
if John Ash and Kelly are still on but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bubble man You would know how to
steer people towards that show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I put it on that was that was all
dragonfly earth medicine All I did was
[SPEAKER_06]: host and listen so the props goes to them
and all the people they Organized and
[SPEAKER_06]: brought on that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Ethan's presentation was really
solid I liked Terry a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just like I was just like am I
gonna go hang out with this guy with this
[SPEAKER_06]: when the self-isolation things over
because he just was like He's just yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's just the mushroom man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love I love that guy You know Todd's got
his I also wanted to mention about You
[SPEAKER_12]: know, the thing about cannabis is that it
brings balance and stasis because it's an
[SPEAKER_18]: adapt Yes, this is true On method of
delivery to any of the studies show should
[SPEAKER_18]: we be eating it or is smoking still okay
or any Yeah, I mean, especially if you
[SPEAKER_22]: have it in your chest They're telling you
not to smoke at all that it all should be
[SPEAKER_22]: ingested if you have respiratory distress
Smoking cannabis is not what you want to
[SPEAKER_22]: be doing you don't even know vaping it is
safe But you know your lungs are trying to
[SPEAKER_22]: recover and your lungs are trying I don't
think That it's it's more just to give
[SPEAKER_22]: your lungs a break from all the you know
stress that just smoking puts on it What
[SPEAKER_06]: about dabs at like 450?
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know mark.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think the research is Is out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe we should do the research.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be the subject I'm set up right now
at 450 degrees.
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well first get infected with the virus and
then we'll Well, I mean again a
[SPEAKER_22]: double-blind study you would have to
actually have Patients with viral load.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's just I don't even know how
you what the mechanism for putting health
[SPEAKER_22]: workers in harm's way and how that Whole
thing plays out, you know, I think as long
[SPEAKER_09]: as you give my dad first they'll go with
it No, well, we're
[SPEAKER_04]: I said we're just following CDC guidelines
and proper six-foot spacing We've also got
[SPEAKER_04]: authorization to do curbside delivery.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things that we're limiting as best as
we can patients access Yeah, I mean check
[SPEAKER_22]: out this for irony.
[SPEAKER_22]: So Pennsylvania as you know has state-run
liquor stores Well, those are all closed,
[SPEAKER_22]: but they deem cannabis As being medically
necessary.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the cannabis stores in Pennsylvania are
open but the liquor stores are closed
[SPEAKER_04]: We're living in the upside-down times for
sure No, go ahead Sam, okay I just wanted
[SPEAKER_09]: to mention that the highest I ever got on
acid was not honestly acid It was a Nick's
[SPEAKER_09]: acid orange sunshine and I ate between 50
and 100 of them I didn't know my friend
[SPEAKER_09]: had dosed his bottle of orange juice with
a hundred hits and I Was so thirsty I
[SPEAKER_09]: walked up to him and I said could I have
some orange juice?
[SPEAKER_09]: He goes yeah, and he's so fucking high
Then he watched me with really big eyes as
[SPEAKER_09]: I drank half the bottle or more Oh my god,
Sam, that's I say that was the highest
[SPEAKER_09]: that I ever was but I was not there So
Yeah, when you turned into a dr. Seuss
[SPEAKER_09]: character No, but luckily my wife was
there so she Took me home in her VW bug
[SPEAKER_09]: and we went back to more candidates and I
was able to sleep that night Because what
[SPEAKER_09]: I've discovered with acid is once you take
more than 500 or a thousand mics You don't
[SPEAKER_09]: you might have a slightly stronger
experience, but it doesn't really last
[SPEAKER_09]: longer Four months as opposed to five it's
pretty safe stuff I'm like I know guys
[SPEAKER_06]: that did very small amounts and just never
came back the same They just had it they
[SPEAKER_04]: just went to a different place Sid Barrett
cough cough Sid Barrett Yeah, I mean I
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't know him personally, but that's
definitely a good example But I don't we
[SPEAKER_06]: all have our own Sid Barrett's like I
remember we had our own Sid Barrett.
[SPEAKER_09]: We called him microwave Yeah, well I never
really had bad trips and I took acid more
[SPEAKER_19]: than 500 times Who has taken a trip during
quarantine already No, thanks I yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I Know my psyche and all that and then
yeah, not the time probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No that not time for high stressor I did
think about it I see a lot of Facebook
[SPEAKER_18]: posts about people showing off their legal
mushrooms now, you know This week it helps
[SPEAKER_19]: with anxiety guys if it's not a very high
dose if you don't feel like if it's not
[SPEAKER_19]: very intense and you don't think about
coronavirus that much and that world is
[SPEAKER_19]: ending I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, it is a nice it is it is a nice
thing and helps out I feel like it Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: welcome Alice and wook sauce.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was Spain?
[SPEAKER_23]: Congratulations on your win there On your
second.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys Actually, it was kind of
crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're quarantined together now since we
came back from Spain I'm not an American
[SPEAKER_19]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was pretty stressful the return.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really thought I wasn't coming back I
actually entered United States one hour
[SPEAKER_19]: before they closed the doors for like any
Outsider, you know any any person that is
[SPEAKER_19]: not an American citizen So it was very a
stressful experience, but we're here safe
[SPEAKER_19]: in his house.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a huge garden I'm inspiring.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting a lot inspired in a damn pure
family right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm using this quarantine time to Plant
a garden and prep a garden which is what I
[SPEAKER_19]: think everyone should do So everyone that
has a garden should do that So now it's
[SPEAKER_19]: this time all of my free time will be
towards that and Spain didn't happen much
[SPEAKER_19]: Stannabis was canceled some cups happen
Happily the ego clash have happened this
[SPEAKER_19]: guy here got first first first in water
hash category.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got second.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very nice Congrats take it home
with the bubble bags or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to overstep my boundaries
Yeah, but it was great so we're doing this
[SPEAKER_19]: and then we're washing we're using a
quarantine to wash to look at resin plant
[SPEAKER_19]: the garden It was nice but was short cut
short.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, I was surprised how many people
went I was supposed to go to Italy on the
[SPEAKER_06]: 24th to see this different form of
extraction I was going to do a tour and
[SPEAKER_06]: then I was kind of like oh geez I don't
know like it sounds like Italy is not
[SPEAKER_06]: doing too well with this like maybe
they're gonna quarantine people I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to get caught up in the quarantine
and that was like weeks before Barcelona
[SPEAKER_06]: like at least two and a half weeks or
something and then people were all like oh
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like What?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I just kind of saw the writing on the
wall I was so surprised at how many of my
[SPEAKER_06]: friends were like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going I was just like Let me
know how it goes Because spannabis I think
[SPEAKER_19]: the spannabis as an event was very
irresponsible and they're still being very
[SPEAKER_19]: Responsible because they posted something
online that they were not going to cancel
[SPEAKER_19]: the event like five days ago And then the
government made them shut down that not
[SPEAKER_19]: made the event not happen and now we have
a new date guys We don't know what the
[SPEAKER_19]: fuck's going on with the world and now
they have a new date on September Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: what I heard was that they did not have
insurance to cover like You know canceling
[SPEAKER_06]: it because of some virus, but if the city
canceled it then they might be insured So
[SPEAKER_06]: they had to wait for the city to cancel
the event and the city canceled the event
[SPEAKER_06]: like on an hour after everyone showed up
to set up their booths Yeah and now
[SPEAKER_19]: everyone showed up everyone grabbed
flights everyone like left work everyone
[SPEAKER_19]: cropped the garden before like one week
before sometimes, you know, like so it's
[SPEAKER_19]: it's a it's very irresponsible,
especially when you're dealing with people
[SPEAKER_19]: that I mean work with cannabis I feel like
Well, I guess yeah, go ahead think about
[SPEAKER_09]: it Spannabis and all these big smoking
events Half the people I know get sick
[SPEAKER_09]: when they go to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah Not denying that that's just a
cold truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking man if Everybody goes there
and Corona hits him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus Christ It's a huge vector like
nobody can deny the vector that is 50,000
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis smokers getting together in a in
a city where everyone that doesn't smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis smokes cigarettes and just
Smoking smoking smoking smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's the sickest I've ever gotten
in my life has been at spannabis and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was no joke I was sick for four weeks hard
like Bedridden like thought I was dying
[SPEAKER_06]: but my wife ended up in the hospital I
know and and we stayed at the same place
[SPEAKER_06]: So what your wife got was what I got like
we all were under the same roof that trip
[SPEAKER_19]: you me Diana and Tony It's crazy to see
that you got sick to Marcus because I know
[SPEAKER_19]: you don't share things with other people I
know you don't share your devices,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like in a moment like this We
always have to think about all this harm
[SPEAKER_19]: reduction strategies that we already know
For like drug consumption, but way more,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, like when we were there I was I
was I was kind of paranoid with bacteria
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody in spannabis shares joints and
shares pipes and shares Long's Way viruses
[SPEAKER_22]: work viruses are completely different,
you know, they're not like bacteria like
[SPEAKER_22]: if you have strep you should be taking an
antibiotic but actually if you have a
[SPEAKER_22]: virus taking an antibiotic is actually Not
the really the best thing you can do for
[SPEAKER_22]: your health and and the thing is is like
well the way viruses viruses are just like
[SPEAKER_22]: bundles of RNA and DNA that get into your
cell and affect your cells and so it just
[SPEAKER_22]: it works completely different than than
than bugs it just it's it's not like a
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not like a bacteria and so and so
when you were saying like yeah,
[SPEAKER_22]: well it's kind of like the kid who ate
dirt as a as a as a child is healthier
[SPEAKER_22]: because his immune system was challenged
with Not like the complete viruses,
[SPEAKER_22]: but just like a piece of the virus I'm not
exactly sure how the body uses like its
[SPEAKER_22]: immune challenges early in your lifetime
to develop an immune response and So like
[SPEAKER_22]: some people may get the corona virus and
it may just be like influenza virus to
[SPEAKER_22]: make it a sore throat it may be,
you know again go through their system and
[SPEAKER_22]: like a week or two, but others are gonna
be really susceptible and I guess it hits
[SPEAKER_22]: the lungs and before you find out if you
don't do the testing in a reasonable
[SPEAKER_22]: period of time it could be too late and
that's when you need the respirator and
[SPEAKER_22]: that's where it puts strain on the medical
system But there is no real you can't
[SPEAKER_22]: really you can attack viruses with a
prophylactic antiviral like they're
[SPEAKER_22]: talking about this chloroquine and all
this other stuff, but they really don't
[SPEAKER_22]: have Things that are specific that fight
these viruses That's why HIV was such a
[SPEAKER_22]: challenge to develop specific antiviral
therapies to treat it I have faith in our
[SPEAKER_06]: immune systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the ultimate laboratory where the
work is done, you know It's the body's own
[SPEAKER_22]: pharmaceutical company, right and so right
and and so on that aspect I think you
[SPEAKER_22]: know, like Ethan hit on this the other
day, which is I think keeping your
[SPEAKER_22]: endocannabinoid system Nourished can only
help right because you're basically gonna
[SPEAKER_22]: get your immune system as good as it could
possibly be To you know fight off what it
[SPEAKER_22]: can and what it can do Ultimately,
I think if you do get a virus whatever
[SPEAKER_22]: virus whether it's a rhino Coronavirus
just common cold or just some other,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know viral infection The best thing
you can do is yes sleep push the fluids
[SPEAKER_22]: get your kidneys working You know and just
you know, try to you know, stay away from
[SPEAKER_22]: things like antibiotics the thing with
antibiotics if you do you take an
[SPEAKER_22]: antibiotic you should be taking You know
live yogurt cultures after that to help
[SPEAKER_22]: reestablish again with these guys were
talking about in the talk the other day,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is your bio Yeah, unfortunately,
you know if you're taking antibiotics
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first thing I wanted to say is that
a lot of the science and everything behind
[SPEAKER_12]: this is all funded by pharmaceutical
companies So let's not forget,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know And they want to come up with
solutions for you that help profit them So
[SPEAKER_12]: that really is bypassing a lot of the
money and the research being put into the
[SPEAKER_12]: natural immune system Which continues to
be you know bypassed because they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: want our natural immune system to be first
and foremost because it's free and it's
[SPEAKER_12]: also because we can make those things or
we can grow those things in our garden so
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that you know, also one thing we
got cut out on before but Cannabis is a is
[SPEAKER_12]: a stasis it creates stasis in the body and
the reason why it creates stasis is
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's an adaptogen So I think that
it's really important for us to continue
[SPEAKER_12]: to look for natural adaptogens and
continue to have faith in our immune
[SPEAKER_12]: system And every time that we take
antibiotics, it's not just the upper tract
[SPEAKER_12]: of our digestive tract that gets washed
out It's also our lower digestive tract as
[SPEAKER_12]: well as different microorganisms that are
inside of our blood so Unfortunately just
[SPEAKER_12]: like balancing with yogurt or a pre or
probiotic afterward is not truly gonna
[SPEAKER_12]: help you we keep going back to soil
microbiology as well as you know birth So
[SPEAKER_12]: many people now around the world are being
born via c-section and and Completely
[SPEAKER_12]: losing a massive amount of the microbiome
that happens during birth Coming through
[SPEAKER_12]: the birth canal which sets us up for life.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sets a tone that we have forever and
ever and nothing really can necessarily
[SPEAKER_12]: penetrate that but unfortunately,
you know this this virus is is is is
[SPEAKER_12]: telling us something we as a human Species
right now are not very healthy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the reason why it's impacting
humanity so much We need to look to our
[SPEAKER_12]: immune system continue to boost our
happiness levels because when we're
[SPEAKER_12]: depressed and we don't feel good we
produce cortisol and that's just a bummer
[SPEAKER_12]: so let's all you know really work on being
happy and I just think that and building
[SPEAKER_23]: our immune system is crucial like Mark was
saying and you know, we drink medicinal
[SPEAKER_23]: mushrooms every single day because we know
there's toxicity out there and viruses out
[SPEAKER_23]: there all the time and medicinal mushrooms
give you killer T cells and Cells that go
[SPEAKER_23]: in it attack viruses that come into our
body and that's what makes us healthy even
[SPEAKER_23]: out of the black plague which killed
millions of people that people lived
[SPEAKER_23]: through the black plague all of a sudden
lived to 70 and 80 years old so in order
[SPEAKER_23]: for us as a human race to get stronger and
live longer we have to look at our
[SPEAKER_23]: ultimate health and it's not Coming from
the medical industry is coming from our
[SPEAKER_23]: food and it's kind of beautiful that the
coronavirus is happening in the spring
[SPEAKER_23]: right now at the best time to start a
garden and to start a food all of the
[SPEAKER_23]: videos that we're seeing from Supermarkets
with people, you know lined up for miles
[SPEAKER_23]: trying to get food when you know it's a
wake-up call to start producing some of
[SPEAKER_23]: your own food at home and then you can
start making your own seed which you're
[SPEAKER_23]: gonna continue growing but when you eat
food From your own garden it gives you
[SPEAKER_23]: endo fights and it gives you Special
compounds from the soil that help you
[SPEAKER_12]: fight off disease and just like our
microbiome right now as a human species is
[SPEAKER_12]: totally out of balance so is our like
faith and and and Feelings about science.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're completely out of balance with it
We're continue to look towards science and
[SPEAKER_12]: away from Mother Nature when she's the one
that has all of the answers We are people
[SPEAKER_09]: of the earth I just wanted to mention that
Transplantation do not want a strong
[SPEAKER_09]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll cause rejection of their organs To
begin with they got there to begin with
[SPEAKER_12]: they're having transplants of a bodily
part because already the Microbiome was
[SPEAKER_12]: already problematic.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to look at the root and not
just say oh well, let's take You know
[SPEAKER_12]: point five percent point zero zero five
percent of the whole population and use
[SPEAKER_09]: that as our as our you know base No,
it's not that i'm using them as an
[SPEAKER_09]: example.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that you That there are groups of
people who cannot make their immune system
[SPEAKER_09]: as strong as possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll kill them That's because they lost
their immune system already to begin with
[SPEAKER_09]: their immune system is gone and then they
have to Transplant patients and they have
[SPEAKER_16]: to deal with it To bring that all together
this the drug that's showing so much
[SPEAKER_16]: promise right now is actually initially
found in the bark of a tree So it's
[SPEAKER_16]: quinine Quinine is basically Well,
that's not chloroquine right there two
[SPEAKER_16]: different compounds Yeah, chloroquine has
a chlorine group added to it to slow the
[SPEAKER_16]: metabolism of it But it's believed to have
the same mode of action, but just lasts
[SPEAKER_16]: long And then hydroxy Chloroquine has
another hydroxyl group hanging off of it
[SPEAKER_16]: somewhere Yeah, it makes a little bit
safer.
[SPEAKER_22]: But isn't that like a metabolite or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_22]: I think is it that a metabolite or
something or it's I think So you can you
[SPEAKER_16]: can try to mimic it with their metabolized
by city of 384 so CBD slows that down
[SPEAKER_16]: Grapefruit juice slows it down.
[SPEAKER_16]: So some folks are just taking quinine And
grapefruit juice to try and stretch the
[SPEAKER_16]: quinine a little bit further You can get
quinine in tonic water, but it's only at
[SPEAKER_16]: 80 like 83 migs per liter So people are
using this at like 400 to 500 migs in some
[SPEAKER_16]: of the kovat patients sometimes twice a
day So I don't know if you get there with
[SPEAKER_16]: quinine But you might be able to get a
prophylactic dose because I'm assuming the
[SPEAKER_16]: prophylactic doses Don't need to be as
high as the dose is required to treat
[SPEAKER_16]: people that have like millions of viral
particles per microliter, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're looking if you look at the qPCR
data in kovat, there's a the viral load
[SPEAKER_16]: and the tissues is outrageous It's really
really high And there's they're managing
[SPEAKER_16]: to reduce that with chloroquine and
hydroxy chloroquine So I would imagine if
[SPEAKER_16]: you're at an early infectious stage and
your viral load is really low You probably
[SPEAKER_16]: don't need the full dose to to push it off
and for it to be preventative But I don't
[SPEAKER_16]: know it's it's all conjecture right now,
but I find it somewhat reassuring that you
[SPEAKER_16]: know, this is this is a drug that actually
like most drugs we found in nature and
[SPEAKER_16]: then modified and so it's Hopefully we'll
be able to get it to the entire world my
[SPEAKER_16]: fear about you know chloroquine and
hydroxy and I mean they all of them have
[SPEAKER_16]: long QT issues you have to if you have a
fib I've got a fib so I can't take it or I
[SPEAKER_16]: got to take very small amounts of it
because it can it can trigger a fib
[SPEAKER_16]: patients to go into long QT so it's got to
be monitored with like in a live core or
[SPEAKER_16]: an Apple watch or something, but There's
gonna be rationing issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the first Pharmaceutical companies
are already donating millions of doses,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is really nice of them But I don't
know that it's gonna get to all seven
[SPEAKER_16]: billion people.
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe it doesn't need to maybe the virus
isn't spread that far But but quinine is
[SPEAKER_16]: something that probably could like that's
an over-the-counter Tonic water,
[SPEAKER_16]: right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah zinc is there's another good study on
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you if you co-administer it with zinc
It's believed the mode of action is still
[SPEAKER_16]: in debate even though it's been around for
70 years But one mode of action that's
[SPEAKER_16]: been proposed is that it's a zinc
ionophore so it transfers zinc into the
[SPEAKER_16]: cell and Zinc is something that stalls the
RNA polymerase so the virus can't
[SPEAKER_16]: replicate But human polymerases seem to be
able to handle zinc just fine,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know that competes for magnesium I
think in the in the polymerases class.
[SPEAKER_22]: So what's the effect of dose to be able to
control symptom ology in a Patient that's
[SPEAKER_16]: got advanced symptoms, you know Yeah,
the famous French paper that came out from
[SPEAKER_16]: Ralph's lab was using a combination of
hydroxychloroquine and I think An
[SPEAKER_16]: antibiotic surprisingly to your point
about antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't understand the mechanism of that
But that antibiotic is it from ice and I
[SPEAKER_16]: think has some activity in Ebola and I
don't I don't know why But typically
[SPEAKER_16]: you're right markets They don't touch
viruses but this this one particular
[SPEAKER_16]: antibiotic seems to be helping and it may
also be helping with any sepsis or
[SPEAKER_16]: pneumonia based infections that are going
on so they're kind of giving them I think
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah, there's probably all kinds of
secondary shit that happens.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's like throw a monkey wrench
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly mark, that's a really important
point, you know everything that we do we
[SPEAKER_12]: really have to think about it as you know,
like dropping that stone in a puddle of
[SPEAKER_12]: water and You know, you don't look at the
first ripple You've got to look at the
[SPEAKER_12]: 50th ripple and when we're dealing with
our, you know, health and well-being
[SPEAKER_12]: that's important So I had a lot of
experience with chloroquine after the
[SPEAKER_12]: tsunami.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was over in the Ache province and
Indonesia, I was working with the WHO You
[SPEAKER_12]: know going down the deep dark holes of
malaria because there was lots of problems
[SPEAKER_12]: after the tsunami and I saw a lot of very
You know moderately healthy people who are
[SPEAKER_12]: testing positive with malaria go on
chloroquine and then become incredibly
[SPEAKER_12]: sick So I don't necessarily feel like you
know on a personal level, you know I hear
[SPEAKER_12]: what other people are saying out there in
the world, but I've personally you know
[SPEAKER_12]: prescribed You know hundreds of people
chloroquine and felt like that was a
[SPEAKER_16]: really bad road to go down What was your
I'm curious what the side effects people
[SPEAKER_16]: should look out for are on it I mean,
I've read about the long QT stuff,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I haven't heard of any you know a lot
of people Feebleness, you know people
[SPEAKER_12]: becoming very weak not only just weak in
their body but also sort of weak in the
[SPEAKER_12]: mind and you're sort of sitting there and
talking to them even after two days of
[SPEAKER_12]: using it and their mind can't stick with
like the same train of thought or You
[SPEAKER_12]: know, of course, I was dealing in a very
big disaster area, you know, there was a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of people that died I was there for a
long time and I know that you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: they had you know sadness and depression
and things on their mind at that time,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it still was Like we called it the
nine-yard stare, you know Like somebody
[SPEAKER_12]: looking off into the distance sort of nine
yards just just not really checked into
[SPEAKER_12]: their body And it was almost like you know
the more that they were on the chloroquine
[SPEAKER_12]: the more that you know They were sort of
leaving their body, which is also like the
[SPEAKER_16]: strength of their being as well You
mentioned that get people get weird dreams
[SPEAKER_16]: on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one side effect I read about but So
yeah, I mean, yeah, you know what the dose
[SPEAKER_16]: is for malaria Do they use more or less of
it than they're thinking about using for
[SPEAKER_16]: for kovat?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what what they're saying
about it I feel like quiet on you know is
[SPEAKER_12]: an awesome idea and you know, we could Go
down that road and talk about it because
[SPEAKER_12]: it's from nature But then again,
you know just like mark was saying when
[SPEAKER_12]: you start to synthesize synthesize things
It really changes how the body uptakes it
[SPEAKER_12]: and understands it though, you know
Unfortunately, I'm not having a whole lot
[SPEAKER_12]: of faith in chloroquine right now,
but that's my own personal opinion You
[SPEAKER_12]: know something else might come out but no
might be awesome But I saw a lot of people
[SPEAKER_12]: have depleted immune systems and depleted
You know vibrational Energy from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, can I ask three questions?
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have three questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: They could be answered in a hole Can we
ever show share joints again?
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we clean the glassware in between uses
so it's safe that we can use the same rig
[SPEAKER_18]: if we clean it and three will our cannabis
gatherings ever be safe if We're not
[SPEAKER_18]: sharing but other people are and then
they're sloughing virus everywhere It's a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of questions
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to be able To break it out Yeah,
they break up they burrow I'll weigh in
[SPEAKER_16]: while he's rezoning in as I I think
there's gonna be a resistant population
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we see that and almost all viral
infections are in any of the models right
[SPEAKER_16]: now All the models you have have this
exponential curve With an R naught of 2
[SPEAKER_16]: which is very similar to a PCR curve PCR
has an R naught of 2 it doubles every
[SPEAKER_16]: cycle, right so But all of the all the
projections are going exponential to the
[SPEAKER_16]: moon They don't have an s-curve in them
and everything in nature typically has an
[SPEAKER_16]: s-curve and that s-curve is a combination
of social distancing of natural immunity
[SPEAKER_16]: of education and what have you so I I
guess I Optimism is healthy for my mental
[SPEAKER_16]: state right now and I'm looking at the
graph In thinking it's not going to be as
[SPEAKER_16]: dooming gloom zombie land as we're seeing
out there And so I think we'll soon have
[SPEAKER_16]: an immunity to this thing like like other
cold viruses that come through our
[SPEAKER_16]: population that we deal with it's just
Where is the sigmoid?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you you made me think of another
fish lyric Kevin right before it was We
[SPEAKER_22]: were treating the symptom and not the
cause now expanding exponentially like
[SPEAKER_22]: summary curve like summary
[SPEAKER_16]: Cold turkey like like, you know,
one knows you're doing it Forward thinking
[SPEAKER_23]: and again just plant and have good food
around us Also, you know one quick thought
[SPEAKER_12]: to what you were saying Debbie is if
you're gonna pass a pipe You can always
[SPEAKER_12]: alight it with Your lighter on the end of
the pipe for a little while I learned that
[SPEAKER_12]: from Bob snobgrass You know, it's a great
way to burn out anything But you know not
[SPEAKER_12]: necessarily during this kovat time by any
means But I think that you know that could
[SPEAKER_12]: be helpful in a social situation But also,
you know, we have to be into what you know
[SPEAKER_23]: type of environment that's been given And
also the fact that it's spring right now
[SPEAKER_23]: that the shoots that are coming out on the
trees are extremely powerful Yes,
[SPEAKER_23]: they're really high in vitamin C and and
terry willard brought up the alder catkins
[SPEAKER_23]: and Finding alder trees and and the buds
that are coming off on and making medicine
[SPEAKER_23]: out of the buds You know like our it's
really powerful medicine even the pine
[SPEAKER_23]: pollen and different pollens that are
coming out are extremely useful to our
[SPEAKER_23]: immune system, so The the beautiful new
growth of life that's happening in the
[SPEAKER_23]: spring we can utilize in our immune
systems right now So it's again good
[SPEAKER_23]: timing if we want to look towards nature
towards Some of for some of our tears even
[SPEAKER_23]: birch bark.
[SPEAKER_23]: You can boil and drink birch bark and get
the betulic acid that's coming from the
[SPEAKER_23]: Cambium layer, which is why chaga is so
important because chaga has the most
[SPEAKER_23]: antioxidants of any Herb or plant on earth
and the chaga tree you can also tap right
[SPEAKER_12]: now a whole lot of people are sorry birch
tree on the top the The birch tree right
[SPEAKER_12]: now and that's something that you can use
directly into an IV So, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's just really interesting how tree
Water and tree blood is almost identical
[SPEAKER_12]: to you know, the same pH and the same
sugars and and nutrient value that our
[SPEAKER_12]: blood is Pretty awesome how nature
provides at the same time search birch
[SPEAKER_23]: polypore is an unknown Anti-viral
antifungal polypore that was one of the
[SPEAKER_23]: three mushrooms found on the Iceman in
Italy, which is very interesting The three
[SPEAKER_23]: mushrooms that were found were the chaga
the birch polypore and the amadou and Go
[SPEAKER_12]: ahead and the birch polypore what we know
about as far as what nature produces.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Absolutely the strongest anti-vermin
the strongest anti-vector Thing the forest
[SPEAKER_12]: grows and it's incredibly bitter But
what's interesting about it is when it
[SPEAKER_12]: grows on the chaga tree or when it grows
in nature It grows on other things than
[SPEAKER_12]: than birch but it's White and it stays
this gorgeous like beautiful white color
[SPEAKER_12]: meaning like nothing in the forest will
attack it So that's just we've actually
[SPEAKER_12]: used that as a foliar spray on plants that
have any kind of mildew Leaf-eating mildew
[SPEAKER_12]: or any plants that are showing rust fungi.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been able to drink it I've given it
to children who have had worms and they've
[SPEAKER_12]: been able to de-vermin themselves within
like a week It's an unbelievable medicine
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a really good there's a really
good book called the cures in the forest
[SPEAKER_23]: and I encourage people to get the book the
cures in the forest and I think the Bark
[SPEAKER_23]: is an underutilized medicine by people
bark tree tips even even tree The bark by
[SPEAKER_23]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's are the the branch itself is at the
very end is very useful to us So I think
[SPEAKER_12]: it's yeah and people the ability right now
go on a walk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get outside Go on walks,
of course keep your social distancing But
[SPEAKER_12]: right now nature just exploded in the
spring and it's such a wonderful
[SPEAKER_12]: opportunity to get out there and you know
Drink lactic acid bacteria and cover
[SPEAKER_23]: yourself in dirt and wash your face and
compost and smoke hashish I've seen you
[SPEAKER_22]: know, I've been we've been because we've
been inside and we've been following this
[SPEAKER_22]: go into The CDC's website and trying to
get the latest and greatest instructions
[SPEAKER_22]: on what we're to do if we are Quarantined
my family here in my house is quarantine.
[SPEAKER_22]: We just want to make sure that we're doing
the right thing and we're you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: and I've heard mixed things some people
say that you should go outside and in
[SPEAKER_22]: other people I I had seen two posts and it
looked like it was from reputable sources
[SPEAKER_22]: where they had a bunch of Activities and
they said please remain indoors Is there a
[SPEAKER_22]: situation where if the virus gets so
widespread in your community that actually
[SPEAKER_22]: staying indoors is what is is more
Beneficial for the collective good of
[SPEAKER_22]: society as opposed to going outside.
[SPEAKER_22]: Does anyone know?
[SPEAKER_12]: Was passed by droplets that we know so the
CDC, you know made a decision a few days
[SPEAKER_12]: ago They were trying to say that it was
airborne.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not it's droplets.
[SPEAKER_12]: So these
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, if you look at the viral load of
the area that you live in if you live in
[SPEAKER_23]: New York or New York City, it would be
really hard to go outside and get that
[SPEAKER_23]: type of thing which really points to The
fact that people living in the country or
[SPEAKER_23]: having that country home is extremely
beneficial right now And that is how we've
[SPEAKER_23]: gotten through the past Sicknesses so
going out if you live near the country
[SPEAKER_23]: Going outside and covering yourself in
dirt and breathing that air is going to be
[SPEAKER_23]: your ultimate health True.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel blessed to have a forest in my
backyard that grows almost all the
[SPEAKER_06]: mushrooms you guys just mentioned like
Right behind the house.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I've been taking walks on the beach
and and trying to get out a good bit here
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in Massachusetts and you know,
I have a lot of family in New York in New
[SPEAKER_15]: York State in New York City and You know,
I've been a resident of New York City and
[SPEAKER_15]: I really feel for them right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's geographically it's not a safe space
so You know if you can get outside If
[SPEAKER_22]: there's a higher propensity of infected
patients by definition there could be a
[SPEAKER_22]: higher propensity of infected services so
like you can just be walking I guess to
[SPEAKER_22]: the store or something put your hand on
the wrong stair railing and get infected
[SPEAKER_22]: that way versus, you know, I live kind of
like in a suburb I guess I'd call it,
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, I mean there is a population
density we lived there's houses around us
[SPEAKER_22]: and stuff and Certainly like when we go to
our there's a grocery store where most of
[SPEAKER_22]: we mostly shop at It's kind of like
unlimited services right now and it's kind
[SPEAKER_22]: of like I've never seen it like this I
don't remember it being like this after
[SPEAKER_22]: 9-eleven This is like a whole new Reality,
it really it really really is Yeah,
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know like large cities like Los
Angeles and New York.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean It was you think again again.
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand this whole flashback of the
curve, but man you need a certain fraction
[SPEAKER_22]: of the population to do those absolutely
It's a big fraction too.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you a really good example is in 1918
when the Spanish flu hit I think it was
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere in Pennsylvania that you guys
threw this huge parade with like 200,000
[SPEAKER_06]: people Yeah, so then like 4500 people died
and massive casualties into the hospitals
[SPEAKER_06]: over the course of the next seven days at
the exact same time in St. Louis,
[SPEAKER_06]: they closed schools churches gatherings of
50 or more people like everything they
[SPEAKER_06]: just closed everything and their curve was
like this long flat like barely like
[SPEAKER_06]: totally non-comparable to what went down
in Philadelphia So that's kind of a good
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of historical context of looking at
Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have done this before like social
isolation Starving out the virus
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely seemed to work at least but
then man Conspiracy folks are just going
[SPEAKER_06]: nuts right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there is some crazy I've listen I've
always had an appreciation for the bizarre
[SPEAKER_06]: the nut bar that you know, like back in
the day I read every single David Icke
[SPEAKER_06]: book I read, you know started with Robert
Anton Wilson got into Terrence But then
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrence led into David Icke and all that
madness of Kathy O'Brien Transformation of
[SPEAKER_06]: America just the craziest shit you could
possibly imagine and I feel like it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: dangerous To Terrence told me something a
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well didn't tell me but through the tapes
He said the anchor of mankind is belief to
[SPEAKER_06]: fervently believe Anything is the anchor
of free thought and when you believe
[SPEAKER_06]: something you automatically cannot believe
its opposite So what I've tried to do in
[SPEAKER_06]: all of this is just kind of keep an open
mind Kind of like I look at at least my
[SPEAKER_06]: government here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're out to get us
They're like, hey, can you guys like
[SPEAKER_06]: please just like social Isolate like it
doesn't seem like the same vibe when I
[SPEAKER_06]: talked to my buddy in New York who's like
They're trying to take our guns.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to make us stay in our
homes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's And I'm just like well, like what a
total difference in the two countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like our governance Like can you
please just stay inside?
[SPEAKER_06]: Canadians are like I guess so like
probably what we should do like seems like
[SPEAKER_06]: the smart thing to do But then from a
conspiracy standpoint You got people
[SPEAKER_16]: thinking two years later since 1918 we
still have a hospital bed problem That I
[SPEAKER_16]: think you can maybe blame on government,
but I don't know about everything else
[SPEAKER_23]: They're saying that you know, I think it's
important to note that it's not that
[SPEAKER_23]: people just carry the virus From one
person to another there's cells inside of
[SPEAKER_23]: healthy bodies that attack viruses and
kill viruses And they're talking about
[SPEAKER_23]: using people's people that get through the
virus have natural antibodies in their
[SPEAKER_23]: blood and in their Bodies that they
they're talking about, you know being able
[SPEAKER_23]: to utilize to create cures for it So it's
very important for people to realize,
[SPEAKER_23]: you know how important it is to be able to
process a virus it happens and it's
[SPEAKER_23]: essential to the the evolution of humanity
How about that all the governments are
[SPEAKER_18]: deeming us essential and allowed to stay
open during the virus that's just it
[SPEAKER_18]: almost blows my mind how cool it is
because like two years ago were felons,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know selling weed to adults and now we
can sell it but uh Man, atn can probably
[SPEAKER_18]: say it too.
[SPEAKER_18]: The responsibility of staying open like
this is pretty overwhelming Yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually just got a letter from the
department of ag in oregon that states
[SPEAKER_12]: because we are an agricultural Company and
we have a lot of agricultural licenses
[SPEAKER_12]: that we're allowed to go on about our
business as long as we keep social
[SPEAKER_12]: distance So for us, it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're gonna, you know, be responsible I
don't know if other people are necessarily
[SPEAKER_12]: responsible out there, but it It's pretty
funny debbie.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're you're saying that you
know, we used to be you know In on the
[SPEAKER_12]: outs and now they're pretty much they sent
us a license in the mail saying go ahead
[SPEAKER_12]: continue to Deliver your cvd to people so
that's what we're doing We're just going
[SPEAKER_12]: to continue to be able to get the medicine
out there So I was really thankful to get
[SPEAKER_12]: a letter from the department of ag saying
go on about your business But I do hear
[SPEAKER_12]: that that's gonna be a big deal for a lot
of companies Does that extend to all your
[SPEAKER_16]: your like subcontractors and all the
people who supply you?
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that's that's where it seems like
it gets a little foggy We have We have We
[SPEAKER_23]: have to have already had a lot of our
product because it's for really difficult
[SPEAKER_12]: right now to get you know supplies Yeah,
it doesn't it doesn't pass over to our
[SPEAKER_12]: suppliers by any means but what it does do
is it helps it keep it keep it open so
[SPEAKER_12]: that if they shut down certain postal
services to certain businesses or areas
[SPEAKER_12]: That they that we will continue to get
mail, you know as long as they continue to
[SPEAKER_12]: stay open, but it's specific to Just our
company and and as far as supplies the
[SPEAKER_23]: lucky thing is we've chosen to live Near a
wilderness so we have endless supplies of
[SPEAKER_23]: medicinal mushrooms that we will be able
to Continue to have medicine no matter
[SPEAKER_06]: what happens So I'd love to hear I'd love
to hear from Jack and hear about what's
[SPEAKER_06]: going on with the most vulnerable because
you know the people that are like blessed
[SPEAKER_06]: enough to own properties and have forests
in their backyard and have all this clean
[SPEAKER_06]: water and not be worried about like how
how are the Vulnerable people of the
[SPEAKER_06]: streets feeling right now during all of
this Yeah, they look like this like how I
[SPEAKER_00]: look right now It's terrible man,
like I like you said I feel very
[SPEAKER_00]: privileged because I'm looking out at a
forest in in front of me because I bailed
[SPEAKER_00]: out the reason I bailed out is because
they closed all of the Emergency shelter
[SPEAKER_00]: areas which you know legitimately if you
have rooms that have hundreds of people on
[SPEAKER_00]: mats Right beside each other they they
can't be open But those people are all on
[SPEAKER_00]: the main corridor streets of downtown like
usually on the main blocks where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 20 to 50 people during the day There
was probably 200 300 on each block like so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's almost a thousand people like in
the main areas all drag in their tents and
[SPEAKER_00]: their shit behind them I Like don't want
to be all Panicky, you know, but I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bureaucrats and The language that
they speak in without actually saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: words or one time saying the words when
all services are shut down They asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: how many outreach workers can I supply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what they think they're gonna do
or try to do is You know how we have
[SPEAKER_00]: military bases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to corral everybody so they can
figure out who's sick and who's not sick I
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate the sick people from the not sick
people and then have all of my staff who
[SPEAKER_00]: generally like work Inside of a building
where people consume drugs and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where they watch them to keep them safe
That they'll be going out and watching
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the community and having people
like the drug users and people who who
[SPEAKER_00]: live in those sorrows Helping one another
in these communities that they'll build
[SPEAKER_00]: that will keep the sick people isolated
from the not sick people It it honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: And and as you can imagine like if you had
a $500 drug habit a day which you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: do many crimes for Yeah, but what are you
gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they say hey man, you have to go
self-isolate so again, I had some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: high-level doctors call me like last
Monday from the province and say They're
[SPEAKER_00]: not from the province from a housing place
and they said What will we What will we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do to get people to go in their
rooms for Two weeks and self-isolate and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said you already know what the answer to
that is lots of drugs Yeah, and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: said okay, so if we offered morphine or
hydromorph tablets and Dexedrine to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who use methamphetamines What else
do you think we would have to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: and could your outreach workers go out and
try to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, like get buy-in from people
because we know that we won't get buy-in
[SPEAKER_00]: because the tenants don't trust us You
know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're the landlord so that Didn't
happen all last week I thought that would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen right away as a way to get people
to go in their rooms But it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to have some kind of work
because you can imagine that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: started giving somebody Tablets to stay in
their room for a thing like this Why would
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to take them away at the end of
the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks they're gonna go back to
committing street crimes at great cost to
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in society if you take the
tablets away from them that you give them
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, so I imagine they're having
some larger philosophical and structural
[SPEAKER_00]: things trying to figure out how that they
would keep it going at the If this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's long gonna be long-term
like a year a year and a half so it may
[SPEAKER_00]: actually really help for somebody like
myself whose Job is to fight for decrim
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean access to drugs and drugs and
shit like that because this crisis may
[SPEAKER_00]: force them to just give drugs to drug
addicts in order to Keep them isolated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know And you know me and my kids were
both sick before this whole shit started
[SPEAKER_00]: so I just decided like this is just too
confusing and stressful so I was lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be able to bail out and come to
the country where we could figure out in a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple weeks if you know That we're good
It's uh It makes my anxiety levels go up
[SPEAKER_06]: for those people to be honest like it's
one family and home and all that Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus man, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have I think my last member count like
two weeks ago was 1700 and so For example
[SPEAKER_00]: with the giveaways to keep people we
follow bc cdc protocols So they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: people close to each other So anybody who
comes for just a giveaway we give the
[SPEAKER_00]: joints away in the street Now we just have
people standing on our block.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't don't come in the Store and the
outreach office unless you need an arc
[SPEAKER_00]: hand kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come to the cost recovery service
unless you're using it and And even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: street population people are panicking man
Like you can tell with the numbers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stocking up with the idea that one
One day that they'll force us to close our
[SPEAKER_00]: doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's the impression Like what's
going on for the uh, the people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and um, yeah, I think man What
if one of the members had it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't want to be all dark,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like i'm sure but it is it is um It is it
is dark it is stress-provoking to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about like the what the what ifs right and
uh, um My my partner she like she's the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the boss of a lot of frontline
services, so I know that uh Talking to her
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely taking Steps to make
sure that everybody has all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information about trying to protect
themselves and all that but it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: does seem pretty Pretty scary and I think
that we'll see like some pretty modified
[SPEAKER_00]: Work protocols for a long time that'll
actually probably change some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of drug policies, you know,
because if they give everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions medically In an emergency
time, then that will change the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: will we look at changing laws later?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah people are people are able to
look inward I mean i'll tell you yesterday
[SPEAKER_06]: at like seven o'clock at night in
vancouver People hung out their apartment
[SPEAKER_06]: windows and clapped for the health work
care workers In in vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wow, like it was like you could hear
people just whoo Like clapping all
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout the city and that was like,
you know vancouver's Never done that
[SPEAKER_06]: that's they've never shown any any type of
respect like that So, you know that people
[SPEAKER_06]: are paying attention to this and they're
looking inward and it gives us an
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity as humanity to be human You
know to choose humanity the thing that we
[SPEAKER_06]: are uh over this sort of reptilian sort of
emotionalist non-empathetic
[SPEAKER_06]: non-compassionate Mentality of just like
capitalism or whatever and hopefully,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that's that's a good Thing I
think that the people are kind of being a
[SPEAKER_06]: little more conscious like okay,
like maybe this is better if we help each
[SPEAKER_06]: other Maybe this is better if we support
each other rather than uh, it's all all
[SPEAKER_12]: for one and one for all It's also the
world's so much smaller All of a sudden
[SPEAKER_12]: we're realizing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I I definitely hear what you're saying
jack You know, it is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_12]: be a socio-economic thing people that are
struggling have a higher chance of you
[SPEAKER_12]: know Maybe contracting the virus because
of health issues also because they don't
[SPEAKER_12]: have a safe environment necessarily to go
to And also this is not a sides thing This
[SPEAKER_12]: is not a oh this country against this
country and I can choose a side like we're
[SPEAKER_12]: all vulnerable to this We all now have
this ability to connect on such a
[SPEAKER_12]: beautiful human level That we can look at
people like you were just saying marcus
[SPEAKER_12]: that they're doing the same thing all over
Europe hanging out their windows At a
[SPEAKER_12]: certain time and they're clapping at the
same time and it's like hey, we are all
[SPEAKER_12]: together I've been I more than ever i've
actually felt during this whole thing Like
[SPEAKER_12]: this beautiful global community the people
that are reaching out to us are from all
[SPEAKER_12]: over the world I get emails and and
messages on my dm from our instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just so beautiful and connecting so
I mean something is opening up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's creating some kind of An opening for
us to be able to have success on another
[SPEAKER_12]: level.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an opportunity We have to be able to
look at the shit that's been given us in
[SPEAKER_12]: this horrible pandemic and find some kind
of opportunity in it so that we can grow
[SPEAKER_12]: and and really align ourselves with a
higher vibration because I don't think
[SPEAKER_12]: that humanity Really has the issue has the
ability to go to a higher vibration unless
[SPEAKER_12]: we're faced with things that are painful
Nothing makes us work harder than things
[SPEAKER_12]: that are painful.
[SPEAKER_12]: So i'm really encouraging everybody out
there to just like Have a look at it and
[SPEAKER_12]: let's go deeper and let's try to reach
this vibration That we're that we all need
[SPEAKER_23]: to be able to get rid of this virus And
that marcus says, you know in canada
[SPEAKER_23]: instead of the scaremongers.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's the care mongers So, you know see
what you can do in your community to be
[SPEAKER_09]: awesome My question is very simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you how do you roll joints without
touching the paper or licking the joint to
[SPEAKER_09]: glue it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a dab No for giving joints away he
means I guess you could yeah exactly you
[SPEAKER_22]: could roll it with machines like a little
sponge the rock cones the rock cones you
[SPEAKER_22]: just You don't have to glue or stick
anything.
[SPEAKER_22]: You just stuff it in there and you could
twist the end with gloved hands,
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess I would cover my hands in dirt
first and then roll the joint and then
[SPEAKER_06]: pass the joint out I haven't smoked a
joint in so many years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not even funny but Well,
I did smoke a pure hash joint,
[SPEAKER_06]: but not like joint joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss I miss that I ruined joints for
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked full melt hash for for like two
and a half years every single day Just had
[SPEAKER_06]: an incredible collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like renee and he's a sweet skunk
and it's shishkeberry all these great hash
[SPEAKER_06]: plants all these great things and then
after two and a half years I realized oh
[SPEAKER_06]: my god, I got to smoke a joint and when I
lit the joint and tried to smoke it it
[SPEAKER_06]: tasted like Like a camel's asshole.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was burnt and just nasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could I never could go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally ruined joints for myself I used
to live in a cloud of smoke You had the
[SPEAKER_22]: world's best hash to let's put it you know
Maybe there's more great hash a joint
[SPEAKER_22]: would taste pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so Yeah, if I ran out of it for a
long time, you know That's the thing
[SPEAKER_06]: because I used to get into these debates
online where people would be like I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: always smoke joints I'm like Have you ever
had full melt hash in your stash for like
[SPEAKER_06]: five years straight?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, and I'm like, well get back to
me when you do Hello Jack.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question which is how did the
joints get rolled that you gave away?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean did humans touch them were they
late?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I used to like babe way way way
back in the day We we have had to hand
[SPEAKER_00]: roll but no I've had a I've used somebody
I did another dispensary's future All of
[SPEAKER_00]: the machines and then when they went to a
white market company, we just bought our
[SPEAKER_00]: own machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have only one Well, I have one human
doing production who himself lives in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly isolated scenario doesn't have a
lot of contact with other people and Since
[SPEAKER_00]: we are like I do run Health Canada sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow all of the Protocol is as best we
can to try to keep people away from here
[SPEAKER_00]: From each other, you know And no no
licking No licking Don't lick the joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was another thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just never get over, you know,
or also getting past the like super wet
[SPEAKER_06]: joint It's like here man here man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, ooh My dab rig Hey Here
I'll show you I don't like I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality control there of what you guys
do cuz But markets here like here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that somebody gave me
Yesterday that that I thought looked
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can see is it rosin or
a solvent extract?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I think well, I think it's a live
resin this guy I've met seems to make most
[SPEAKER_00]: of his like and this I think this is
chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Wow Wow That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the shadow from the same guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad I would like everyone to show the
camera what they're smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would that wouldn't that be a nice
screenshot?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice when the camera gets like
goes and focuses properly on your this is
[SPEAKER_06]: great Oh Nice cream Wade's got the sheesh
there a little stone of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Marcus.
[SPEAKER_22]: Make sure you get a screenshot of this,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well we can make one cuz I'm
recording it This is great for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think almost everyone had a stash up
there I got sugar times triangle Kush
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw everyone hold up their jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys familiar with the Calix
containers?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, dude, I love these containers Mike
West turned me on to these containers He
[SPEAKER_06]: met this guy Jake who works with Calix
down in I guess in the US somewhere They
[SPEAKER_06]: stack really nice on top of one another if
you notice it's got this little piece here
[SPEAKER_06]: and it stacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a it's a square container you can
open it with one hand all you do is really
[SPEAKER_06]: squeeze on the on the lid and What I like
about it also is It's a good amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: extract for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some bubble hash some some wedding
cake That I got from a concentrated X,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it also has a little turp skirt About
this a little PTF Turpene protecting cover
[SPEAKER_06]: from consuming your plastic lid PTFE PTFE.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sorry Same thing we used when we did
the terpenes inside the terpene lids
[SPEAKER_06]: because some of those companies weren't
using those and it was crazy how the Terps
[SPEAKER_06]: were just consuming the inside of the
container It would make this weird
[SPEAKER_06]: plasticky sticky mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got to give these guys FEP That's a
what?
[SPEAKER_17]: FEP liner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike Mike would know he turned
me on What's FEP he's unmuting It's
[SPEAKER_17]: similar to it's similar but it's not as
reactive to terpenes that's one of the
[SPEAKER_17]: things that they're saying that I Suppose
FEP makes better of the clique.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's essentially a clear transparent Liner
But anti-stake terpene proof moisture
[SPEAKER_17]: oxygen blocking barrier and then it's got
an o-ring in it Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the jars man Have you noticed that
it keeps your stash better longer question
[SPEAKER_04]: mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um You know, I smoke my stash pretty quick
I'll just be oh But if I just like the
[SPEAKER_06]: access that I have I like the size of it I
like the way they stack in my Pelican case
[SPEAKER_17]: and I like They need they need Myron bases
and recycled plastic or hemp That those
[SPEAKER_17]: are my only two complaints Because I do
like I do like having clear bottles so you
[SPEAKER_17]: can show off your oil But that clear
bottom is gonna let in UV light
[SPEAKER_17]: alternatively if you have a Myron or some
sort of cobalt or amber glass that's gonna
[SPEAKER_17]: reduce the amount of UV degradation It
does have a seal in it though.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm impressed with the Should the shelf
stability of the smell especially in
[SPEAKER_17]: higher?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just not a fan of these ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to push down and open I don't
think they're quite as good of a jar They
[SPEAKER_04]: just don't seem to we kind of have to
carry that we have to carry those in
[SPEAKER_04]: California and fortunately due to the you
know, the Controls here to here to I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah thing which is a frustration because
it causes a major problem for a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people who Or get older to have arthritis
and it's a major problem with these
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrates is they're not One everything
is printed so small.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a problem to then people who suffer
from any type of hand debilitation It
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely has a very difficult time
getting into them So that's something
[SPEAKER_04]: we're working with the state on that we
have to do better as well as especially
[SPEAKER_04]: environmentally sound because there's
still ungodly amount of over packaging and
[SPEAKER_04]: plastics for small amount of concentrates,
it's obnoxious and we're not even talking
[SPEAKER_04]: the pens so it's just what we have to
carry carry in for the product to get it
[SPEAKER_04]: out the door what we're Loading onto the
consumer is still overbearing and
[SPEAKER_04]: outrageous for what they're they're buying
really Yeah, I agree Back to this Corona.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody know if the majority of
patients who have Corona if they got it
[SPEAKER_09]: from droplets From people coffin or from
their hands from touching a contaminated
[SPEAKER_09]: surface.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody know?
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey Sam, this is this is Colin I I have
two people that are close to me that have
[SPEAKER_15]: it in New York City and One of them got
turned away from the hospital yesterday
[SPEAKER_15]: and They believe they got it from touching
surface areas That's the only way that
[SPEAKER_15]: they they weren't around people that they
remember sneezing or Some people don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have the symptoms like some people carry
it without the symptoms So it's sure never
[SPEAKER_06]: know if you touch the surface or if you
inhaled it in the air if you yeah Just
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's scary about it Sam that was
he was trying to ask me a question a while
[SPEAKER_00]: back, but I keep getting a kid It was just
about the joints oh Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry distracted by children as soon as we
heard it was regarding droplets We had
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody especially since it could
survive on paper since we handle cash as
[SPEAKER_04]: well as plastic cards We had everybody
immediately go to gloves a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something once we heard about
immediately we implemented before any Here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Holland in the CDC
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing as I have the guys wearing
gloves because of physical money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best thing that I can do,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here in Holland the majority of businesses
no longer take cash.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to pay with a with a pay card a
debit card That's what I came across
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to implement a cashless society
Research I've done that I can show you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys It's to promote the false round globe
theory.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we don't get that Debbie and I can
attest we don't get that love here in
[SPEAKER_04]: California we definitely have to have
access to cash or even ATMs on site
[SPEAKER_04]: because Everybody rolls around in a very
much cashless society and that's just the
[SPEAKER_04]: reality of what they're trying to do But
the reality that we deal with that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay our taxes in cash and all that we
still have to deal heavily in cash,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we always stay or try to stay
up-to-date on things such as this so that
[SPEAKER_04]: we can you know respond and react
accordingly because you can always launder
[SPEAKER_16]: your cash, you know with Maybe UVC or
something like there's UVC bulbs that will
[SPEAKER_16]: help.
[SPEAKER_18]: We should do a whole show on that Kevin We
got a compliant bank account recently the
[SPEAKER_18]: first one really since working with you
Back in the day before Bank of America
[SPEAKER_18]: kicked us out Dama financials.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys know those guys they Do this very
high-level?
[SPEAKER_18]: Scrutiny to FinCEN standards and then
somehow hook you up with a bank.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's FDIC approved.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've been Officially formally legally
banking for about two weeks now after we
[SPEAKER_18]: got kicked out of our 10-year long credit
union It finally was like you guys are
[SPEAKER_18]: gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you drop that link for me,
please?
[SPEAKER_02]: 38 banks We have a credit union compliant
credit union seaport that I've worked with
[SPEAKER_15]: for a year it's wonderful Yeah,
Massachusetts has has just a few but it's
[SPEAKER_15]: it's been okay here But if there's if
there's you know information to be shared
[SPEAKER_15]: I would I'd love to read on it and better
understand it
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys get kicked out of a bank,
what what do they what reason do they give
[SPEAKER_22]: you?
[SPEAKER_22]: What do they say?
[SPEAKER_22]: What what's the offense that they're
kicking you out?
[SPEAKER_18]: What's marijuana being federally illegal
and jeopardizing they know that going?
[SPEAKER_18]: Setting up an account with you For
example, the latest one I've been kicked
[SPEAKER_18]: out of because I've been kicked out of all
the finest large banks and a couple small
[SPEAKER_18]: banks the latest one Ten years ago,
they weren't so nervous.
[SPEAKER_18]: So The original operators of Magnolia
walked in talked to the president told
[SPEAKER_18]: them what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: They said fine ten years later,
they reevaluated their stand on things and
[SPEAKER_18]: just sent a note saying We're closing your
accounts on this day.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was like three weeks.
[SPEAKER_18]: I I called I told him that's not fair
Really, you know, it's not enough time for
[SPEAKER_18]: me to get things going.
[SPEAKER_18]: They gave me an extra week and that was
that Give us any reason when they close
[SPEAKER_06]: our bank accounts up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's run the whole gambit from Day
before payroll getting a call saying the
[SPEAKER_04]: checks in the mail you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's that's lovely As well as it's
it's usually just the same It's just the
[SPEAKER_04]: it's federal illegal or there was an audit
done from some And we were contacted by
[SPEAKER_04]: the feds that we can't deal with your
cannabis account and blah blah blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so Yeah, there's been like I said 38.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there each one's been different But all
of them mostly the same usually checks on
[SPEAKER_04]: the way expect it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're done with us So we always
investigate and have a couple in our back
[SPEAKER_04]: pocket in preparation Yeah, because you
have to do that that's the reality I just
[SPEAKER_04]: want to act normal That's all we want to
do is be normal businesses because we are
[SPEAKER_04]: normal retail businesses, but the
frustration is none of Us can use proper
[SPEAKER_04]: banks or when we do you have a limited
time only Yeah, ain't that the truth well
[SPEAKER_06]: one trip I can give one tip I can give for
Canadians.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in Columbia I don't know if it was
six months ago or something and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: standing in line to to get checked in onto
the plane and It was another woman just
[SPEAKER_06]: one woman and she was a Canadian woman who
was like working with the banks in
[SPEAKER_06]: Columbia Canadian Bank but doing You know
building everything up and I told her,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I've had as a cannabis company
I've had some problems with with the banks
[SPEAKER_06]: in Canada and she's like, oh that's
strange So we started talking about it and
[SPEAKER_06]: she finally started asking me questions
and she said She said you don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: American accounts do you and I said well,
yeah, of course and she said oh That's
[SPEAKER_06]: that's where it's half.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's where it came from and I'm
like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like well if you were
operational with a bank for 15 plus years
[SPEAKER_06]: and then overnight they hit you up and
said they were Closing your accounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can guarantee you from working at banks
but that would have come from America
[SPEAKER_06]: because they know if you have American
money in your bank account like they know
[SPEAKER_06]: they they like to know where their money
is they can investigate American accounts
[SPEAKER_06]: and if they just did a little research on
yours and decided they didn't like what
[SPEAKER_06]: you were doing they could have they have
the power to absolutely call the bank and
[SPEAKER_06]: because the relationships are the Canadian
banks are terrified of upsetting the big
[SPEAKER_06]: American banks because everything goes
Through the big American banks like you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't do money transfers without going
through Chase Manhattan You can't do any
[SPEAKER_06]: of this stuff even in Canada without those
big American banks So a lot of that if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're in the cannabis industry and you're
having problems with banks It's a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of a bummer to lose that exchange each
time but that could be the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between having your accounts Closed up
here and and not having them closed When
[SPEAKER_22]: do you think and again, I'm just thinking
out loud here that it could just be a
[SPEAKER_22]: matter of like the whole federal and not
the federal regulation, but just this this
[SPEAKER_22]: WHO thing or this United Nations stupid
thing that as soon as that thing just
[SPEAKER_22]: triggers that there'll be some bank like
Bank of America or one of these large big
[SPEAKER_22]: banks who say you know what half of our
fucking workforce our cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_22]: it's okay to do business with the cannabis
industry and completely Open the industry
[SPEAKER_22]: with welcome arms in fact have like
marketing deals marketing towards the
[SPEAKER_22]: ATN's and the Debbie's and trying to get
all of this money I mean it to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like it's an untapped opportunity.
[SPEAKER_22]: We already know that the market is there
right?
[SPEAKER_22]: So the fact is is that?
[SPEAKER_22]: ATN's business needs financial services.
[SPEAKER_22]: They need point-of-sale transactions They
need to be able to pay their paychecks do
[SPEAKER_22]: all their expenses do all their taxes And
all that stuff that any business needs
[SPEAKER_22]: right?
[SPEAKER_22]: Why is the cannabis industry still being
penalized?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's because this 280 bullshit or this
fucking federal and this International
[SPEAKER_22]: fucking stupid treaty that all the money
is somehow tied up I always think that you
[SPEAKER_22]: know, who is the executive?
[SPEAKER_22]: In the bank that just closed down Debbie's
account.
[SPEAKER_22]: Who is the guy who basically signed off?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's just close them again.
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll bounce To some other bank.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like his business is now losing
account.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's Generating revenue they're gonna
just go to another bank for just another
[SPEAKER_22]: executive Maybe that dude's a weed smoker
and he won't shut him down.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's There's so much illegal
activity happening through banks so many
[SPEAKER_18]: criminals way more sophisticated and
dangerous than us and just like everything
[SPEAKER_18]: we're always the low-hanging fruit for the
feds they use a To wedge into taking away
[SPEAKER_18]: civil liberties locking up huge
populations of people and just being
[SPEAKER_18]: general, you know Super jerks.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the banks are afraid that if they
have us in there, we're on every website
[SPEAKER_18]: in town, you know The feds will open the
door and see all the really criminal stuff
[SPEAKER_18]: that the banks are engaged in so they
don't want us in there you guys see that
[SPEAKER_16]: HBSC like manufacturing money laundering
suitcases And when they got bagged they
[SPEAKER_04]: got a fine You got to understand though,
there's a great passion for Debbie Debbie
[SPEAKER_04]: used to come to work when we're back when
they always work at BPG and she just
[SPEAKER_04]: called the D local DA office and just
start talking to the DA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you a cop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you against marijuana?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you totally against this just
totally?
[SPEAKER_18]: Me and ATN both got well wrapped up in
this federal case with Ed Rosenthal and
[SPEAKER_18]: yeah That's the DEA agent that came to my
door to serve the subpoena.
[SPEAKER_18]: He was so nice like dude Like how can you
like you seem nice?
[SPEAKER_18]: Why are you working for the DEA?
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what he told me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't even believe it Oh,
you know, I got involved because I wanted
[SPEAKER_18]: to stop criminals like serious people Etc.
[SPEAKER_18]: Etc.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was all fun till I had a kid,
but then I realized those guys Had guns so
[SPEAKER_18]: I asked if I could get switched over to
the marijuana Department where I could
[SPEAKER_18]: just go after marijuana users.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you fucking kidding me coward coward?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds about right though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Whoo, low hanging fruit versus
like work and put your life on on the line
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly, but it also For us to understand,
you know Sun Tzu understand know your
[SPEAKER_04]: enemy better than you know yourself You
know understand what their mindset is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I I still watch cops and other
things I just want to understand their
[SPEAKER_04]: modus operandi.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they actually doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they interacting people understand
their Mentality gives you a better
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding about what you're dealing
with what you're fighting against because
[SPEAKER_04]: again They're humans too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually we were able to connect
with enough grassroots people and around
[SPEAKER_04]: that we were able to change laws in states
that we changed that momentum that went
[SPEAKER_04]: from it's never gonna happen in your
lifetime kid to when's it coming to my
[SPEAKER_22]: state, you know, it's I I totally
understand that for a cop or someone in
[SPEAKER_22]: law enforcement I don't understand that
for a banker For a banker who's watching
[SPEAKER_22]: the economy go and now what you see,
I don't know if you've seen these numbers
[SPEAKER_22]: 18 but actually cannabis store revenues
are up in California, right because people
[SPEAKER_22]: again They're buying lots of toilet paper
and buying lots of stuff with the shops
[SPEAKER_22]: when they go but you know, the point is is
that Someone in the bank who's a financial
[SPEAKER_22]: guy not a law enforcement is saying No,
we can't do this.
[SPEAKER_22]: We have to keep this client out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Do you really think that they're
just making that decision or do you think
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a memo from the Defense Department
or some other high-ranking government?
[SPEAKER_04]: They all came from high up They all
exactly they all say we're really sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a great relationship, but it's not
me It's come from above 99% of the time.
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I believe it does So so do you think
that there's like what like people at the
[SPEAKER_22]: DEA?
[SPEAKER_22]: Who drip on these senior executives in the
banks?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think the DEA are involved at
all I think it goes with if they're like
[SPEAKER_06]: over here the banks are here and whoever's
telling the banks probably White House.
[SPEAKER_22]: So what so Marcus?
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you think not that it makes a
difference?
[SPEAKER_22]: But what was the Colonel that led to
Debbie's Bank?
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically giving them the boot.
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the thing that first started like
was we're You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just trying to think like why I always
think I always think this This is a group
[SPEAKER_06]: of people that have a very very very
different mentality Quite possibly the
[SPEAKER_06]: opposite of the mentality that cannabis
gives you potentially and it's the
[SPEAKER_06]: greatest fear.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have is that while they're trying to
continually brainwash society with their
[SPEAKER_06]: beliefs and their core values That aren't
really everyone else's beliefs and core
[SPEAKER_06]: values that they just That nothing cuts
through that bullshit better than herb
[SPEAKER_06]: While cutting through the bullshit of
their pharmaceutical lies while cutting
[SPEAKER_06]: through the bullshit of their justice
system while cutting like it's just it's
[SPEAKER_06]: the ultimate enemy to to this long-term
agenda of just You know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to go too deep down the
rabbit hole and think it's some huge
[SPEAKER_06]: conspiracy I like to call it an agenda
because a conspiracy and It's you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's sort of insinuates that maybe it's
not happening At all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all make-believe but this we
know this is happening The word Prosperity
[SPEAKER_12]: and also, you know mark one thing I was
trying to say are thinking about is where
[SPEAKER_12]: do all the banks, you know last I heard
they've all been bailed out by the
[SPEAKER_12]: government So who's really in charge of
the banks?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know like the the mass amount of money
that banks even have to be able to be
[SPEAKER_12]: running right now It's from somebody up
above them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the banker is not making any yeah,
they're all nationalized now I mean,
[SPEAKER_16]: right you're just given notice that they
can do a zero reserve lending.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're lending out money.
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't have They've been doing that
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always been levered though.
[SPEAKER_16]: They've always had like a forty to one
ratio of you know What is it called
[SPEAKER_16]: fractional reserve, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: They've always had but they put out a note
on Sunday saying fractional reserve They
[SPEAKER_06]: can loan money they don't have but this is
just like when money went from gold to not
[SPEAKER_06]: Representing gold anymore to just now
represent a paper that you print.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just The next version of that
which is terrifying.
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the exchange today between the
dollar and the euro?
[SPEAKER_22]: It was almost the unity, right?
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean Right.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh not the dollar in the euro.
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe a dollar in the pound.
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I thinking I haven't been tracking out
that particularly currency pair But we're
[SPEAKER_16]: all printing money like mad right now.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's kind of do comparison So what's
the law isn't the long-term impact is that
[SPEAKER_22]: that's gonna ultimately devalue the
currency and like the next say Yep and
[SPEAKER_22]: full of your say from three to five years
from now a bunch of currency today They
[SPEAKER_16]: tripled the money supply between there you
go between I think the last crash in this
[SPEAKER_16]: one 2008 in this one However, they didn't
rain it from helicopters or give it to
[SPEAKER_16]: people they gave it to bankers and it
didn't necessarily There's a cantillion
[SPEAKER_16]: effect.
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't really get into the economy
completely.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we probably haven't seen Widespread
inflation we've been seeing inflations in
[SPEAKER_16]: certain arteries that they're subsidized
But I think what's gonna happen next is
[SPEAKER_16]: we'll probably see inflation a little bit
more immediately because they are gonna
[SPEAKER_16]: probably Rain it on everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: They can it seems to be the only trick to
have right now When they should grow
[SPEAKER_18]: wheat, yeah That's what it is Isn't there
hemp in the money?
[SPEAKER_18]: I was gonna say ATN remember when we first
got closed down by Bank of America before
[SPEAKER_18]: that they loved us.
[SPEAKER_18]: They knew what we were doing We used to go
down and the teller would be like and
[SPEAKER_18]: smelled the money be like, oh we love you
guys and they were even talking about
[SPEAKER_18]: giving us a house loan and then At that
point they told us that there was some
[SPEAKER_18]: wing of their company that Evaluated these
kind of I don't know sinful I don't know
[SPEAKER_18]: what you would call them the activities
and whenever they flagged one in their
[SPEAKER_18]: banking system They would look at it and
if they've been there and been good
[SPEAKER_18]: banking good good banker, you know banking
partners or whatever They just let him
[SPEAKER_18]: roll and they decided that sort of
Berkeley patients group and some Local
[SPEAKER_18]: vice shops, you know, like we're still
they were still letting us roll but of
[SPEAKER_18]: course shortly after that we did find out
that our bank was being Monitored I guess
[SPEAKER_18]: by the Department of Justice and when they
got a fat juicy balance one time they
[SPEAKER_18]: seized the money took all the money and
booked in our account negative 999 million
[SPEAKER_18]: 999 thousand 999 dollars me and ATN were
negative billionaires there for a moment
[SPEAKER_04]: in time That's when they DEA seized that
when our when our see CPG got destroyed in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2007.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Don actually went down to the bank
While they were seizing the account and
[SPEAKER_04]: took all the money out of the bank account
by the time the lien got on the DEA Shit
[SPEAKER_06]: you not and that's proof right there that
there there's an agenda like deeply deeply
[SPEAKER_06]: disturbing agenda against cannabis to the
point where they would never do that even
[SPEAKER_06]: to a money launderer to a massive drug
lord like the same thing with like when
[SPEAKER_06]: they arrested Mark Emory and it was like
The the number of pounds they said that
[SPEAKER_06]: his cannabis seeds grew was exactly the
number That allowed you to charge someone
[SPEAKER_06]: with the kingpin law, which was like the
death penalty Which was pretty intense up
[SPEAKER_06]: here when he was just like he people were
like, oh you can't go down there Like they
[SPEAKER_06]: might kill you and he was just like no.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm going I'm going I'm not can't run
away from this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just like Sounds like kind of like
the thing you run away from like Like be
[SPEAKER_06]: having your life threatened seems like no
they tried to do that to our friend at
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosenthal and I remember Debbie and I I
mean we were the two of the recalcitrant
[SPEAKER_04]: seven because we knew that we could only
give the fifth and tenth amendment before
[SPEAKER_04]: the federal court because if they if
anybody said Yes, he was the boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were gonna put kingpin charges on Ed
and it was life in jail So it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_04]: death sentence per se but it was a death
sentence that I would never see my friend
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Thankfully all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we all went down First it was a
grand jury.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to go through then it was the
actual federal we had to go up before the
[SPEAKER_04]: actual judge declare our fifth and tenth
amendment and Fortunately, we were held in
[SPEAKER_04]: contempt and they let us go home.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was weird They never even booked it on
our records ATN.
[SPEAKER_18]: They didn't book them.
[SPEAKER_18]: They didn't book them They actually when
we refused to testify against Ed Rosenthal
[SPEAKER_18]: they put all of us on trial me and ATN got
put on trial for civil and criminal
[SPEAKER_18]: contempt of court For refusing to testify.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are heat scores And we still
refuse to testify and they literally made
[SPEAKER_18]: us go on on trial and federal court here
in the Ninth Circuit and stand to get on
[SPEAKER_18]: the stand and And me and ATN realized they
were letting us make little speeches.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Judge Breyer So our speeches were
all like what we're doing is right We're
[SPEAKER_18]: supporting the will of the people.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't understand why the government has
us here.
[SPEAKER_18]: The government's actually wrong in this
case And one by one we got up and said
[SPEAKER_18]: that it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: The judge was like he gave a speech about
us He said something like when people look
[SPEAKER_18]: at this case and they should They'll see
how you can bring strongly held views into
[SPEAKER_18]: the federal court in a dignified manner
that gets them heard and and and then he
[SPEAKER_18]: said if if you guys are guilty of civil
contempt of court if Going to jail will
[SPEAKER_18]: make you testify against Adam in a
sentence You to jail if it won't make you
[SPEAKER_18]: testify against Ed.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna send you home.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're like Our lawyers were like I get
out of here get out They literally let us
[SPEAKER_18]: just say like no, but no matter what we're
not gonna testify in the end and Judge
[SPEAKER_18]: Breyer sent us home and even though he
found us guilty He never booked it on a
[SPEAKER_18]: record.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was really pretty epic slash
stressful and So and Debbie, it's actually
[SPEAKER_04]: being taught I'm told in law schools and
how to do proper civil disobedience in
[SPEAKER_08]: federal court Crazy solid very solid you
guys Very good Bong rip mother lovers.

sort of and shoot the shit and tell some
[SPEAKER_06]: stories and you know feel Feel better feel
good Very stressful times out there.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the funny thing is that there's
still a bunch of people in the chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I Looked earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like 47 people or something.
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay 27 now still though Delayed,
you know broadcast, you know shows you how
[SPEAKER_06]: many people make a day Matthew Clark says
anyone in here know if after I let my hash
[SPEAKER_06]: dry on cardboard does it need some time
and Jar to cure it seems like the longer
[SPEAKER_06]: it stays in the jar the more oily and
better it smells Yes, and yes and yes So
[SPEAKER_06]: many people like I always ask people well
Do you understand what cured is because
[SPEAKER_06]: cured isn't like when you make your hash
and it's all brand new like that's
[SPEAKER_06]: Preserved do you want to preserve your
hash and put it and put it in a freezer or
[SPEAKER_06]: a fridge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to cure your hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a little different that
involves turp burping and you know aging
[SPEAKER_06]: your hash in different varieties of
Containers and temperatures and places so
[SPEAKER_06]: it all kind of turns out weird and
different That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: My oldest is is gonna be ten years old
this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh Man, I've tasted that so it tastes like
crazy though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this not taste crazy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, like perfume and just rips your
fucking head right off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so Wasn't traditional Afghani buried
for two years and then actually pressed
[SPEAKER_04]: after it was sieved I'm guessing Sam might
know this Sam wasn't that they were really
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to age it to be honest What they
were doing was just waiting for somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: to buy it Look at the color of that shit
So they were just storing it in the bank
[SPEAKER_04]: of the they were just storing it in the
bank of the earth and until buyer came
[SPEAKER_08]: around You guys this strawberry banana
kush, I guess it is Then this one here,
[SPEAKER_08]: which one's that jalapeno pepper I was
gonna say looks like some fucked up Wilded
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, dude, you need to like take
care of that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcus yeah, I Got some cool seeds from
Great Lakes Greece friends over there I
[SPEAKER_02]: got some all kinds of different
watermelons and heirloom tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Another hobby of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So got some beautiful seed trade from Andy
over there Just just few days ago and all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of unique greens and brassica So we
did kind of a northern latitude or
[SPEAKER_02]: northern region trade for pipes that he's
saved by seed and his own varieties Nice
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomato heirloom tomato, what is your best?
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't grow I grow sungrown no cover
tomato heirloom here So I have to have
[SPEAKER_02]: adapted or ones that do well I try out
about 15 plus varieties each year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the pineapple slicer Out West out in
Northern California was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't tried out here yet Cherokee
purple and brandy wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the two winners.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those You grew those in your
greenhouse didn't you Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely We would get easily more than a
hundred kilos every year We got single a
[SPEAKER_09]: dose of brandy wines that were more than
one kilo did you pull a lot of tomatoes
[SPEAKER_06]: off your wall in your Living room there in
your window.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh Yes, we also grew but the the container
the little 10-liter pots with them in your
[SPEAKER_09]: window they don't yield so many I've even
had 20 liters on the floor with all the
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit coming over to move to the window
Did I'll still say your tomato vine that
[SPEAKER_06]: was in your window in your apartment in
Amsterdam was nicer than like most of the
[SPEAKER_09]: tomato plants I've seen people grow in
their gardens well We love tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_09]: Dutch tomatoes are the worst in the world
So you gotta find some solution and
[SPEAKER_06]: heirloom tomatoes is the way to go Dutch
tomatoes are the equivalent of iceberg
[SPEAKER_06]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I kind of like iceberg lettuce Dutch
tomatoes just I mean they have no smell
[SPEAKER_09]: very little taste They look red from the
day you buy them to the when you throw
[SPEAKER_09]: them away.
[SPEAKER_09]: They look Like a tomato, but they ain't it
looks like Alice's got a seed collection
[SPEAKER_02]: going Have you tried stewed peach
tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_19]: I have already yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if there's anyone in Northern,
California, I want seeds I can't tree
[SPEAKER_19]: seeds yet because I don't have seeds yet
But I will collect it in the end of the
[SPEAKER_19]: year, but I would trade out I accept
donations of seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll go grab it after I'm quarantined of
Spain, you know, just to make sure you
[SPEAKER_19]: guys are all safe.
[SPEAKER_22]: Back to Wade Wade, where are you?
[SPEAKER_19]: I am now I am in Sebastopol like Santa
Rosa area There's a Real easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're still doing it in
Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a group the Sonoma Valley Cannabis
enthusiast or something like that that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing for a couple of years regular
meetings every Tuesday, I think and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're teaching people how to grow they
have a program campaign called grow six
[SPEAKER_01]: big ones which in the You know in the
California scheme, you can grow your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: six plants for your personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And yeah, their whole thing was grow
six big ones outdoors And they're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: away a lot of seeds over there,
but with the quarantine thing Might be
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest if you could just Reach out to me
and I can send you some of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: got sitting here because I have way more
seeds than I'm ever gonna sprout and
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be mostly CBD and THC things
together CBD and stuff helps what I want
[SPEAKER_19]: also veggies Yeah, I got a bunch of clones
downstairs and some seeds pop some seeds
[SPEAKER_19]: to pop some bio vortex seeds now and also
sunshine stuff like some some of the seeds
[SPEAKER_19]: I collected in her garden some rebel moon
stuff I'm waiting for it to pop can't wait
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm gonna do the six outdoor with this
once and let's check out how they're gonna
[SPEAKER_19]: be phenol hun maybe on that But I really
want heirloom tomatoes like I'm gonna prep
[SPEAKER_19]: like I need Josh and Kelly I kind of like
me to maybe to call you guys and Show the
[SPEAKER_19]: garden because it's like from zero.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no idea how to start like I have a
bunch of ideas on how to like what to do
[SPEAKER_19]: but How to start is very hard like start
digging.
[SPEAKER_19]: I started digging yesterday checking the
soil We got you girl.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll do a little face time and in the
backyard Yeah, we can do another zoom when
[SPEAKER_06]: we get off of here sometime It sounds like
a good series for a show like Alice and
[SPEAKER_06]: whoop doing a garden getting help from
Josh and Kelly No recorded every week or
[SPEAKER_08]: two.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to be involved too, please You
know some will will get rid of pests some
[SPEAKER_08]: will attract proper stuff like that's the
stuff that I have totally You know another
[SPEAKER_06]: good person for that is is Sean Lowe's
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's he's cool He had these little vials
of his cannabis seeds Filled with all
[SPEAKER_06]: these other seeds that are the beneficial
plants that he grows around his cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plants In his area and he likes to give
them to people that live in that similar
[SPEAKER_06]: terroir and they're always like what the
fuck is this and he's like well those
[SPEAKER_06]: those are like the cannabis seeds and then
these other seeds are like a Variety of
[SPEAKER_06]: other plants that are gonna help you out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like Yeah, we always do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of like we give out big fat
bags of seeds and everybody's really
[SPEAKER_12]: stoked I'm saying, you know, you'll find
the cannabis seeds intermixed in there for
[SPEAKER_23]: sure You got a search for I mean,
I wanted to also say to for people to look
[SPEAKER_23]: up peace seedlings and peace seeds online
They're out of Corvallis, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_23]: but we've walked their gardens before and
Alan Capular is The man who runs it but
[SPEAKER_23]: his kids run the peace seedling art So
both of them sell seeds, but they grew 200
[SPEAKER_23]: varieties of tomatoes on their property
and Alan has been breeding tomatoes for
[SPEAKER_12]: His whole life so adult life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah a lot of the reasons why Delicious
tomatoes have hit market is because of
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan and really cool to check out his
varietals Beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: I originally got my tomato seeds from the
seed savers exchange I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_09]: you're familiar with that group,
but it was started by Kent Wheely years
[SPEAKER_09]: ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a lifetime member for 40 35 40
years So I imagine you have some good
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds That oil of oregano oil went down
the wrong pipe Dr. Alan Capular he grows
[SPEAKER_20]: wild garden seeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been buying their varieties for
years.
[SPEAKER_20]: He does great greens.
[SPEAKER_20]: He does an amazing rainbow kale Which is a
red Russian cross with the lacinato That's
[SPEAKER_20]: our top favorite has a lot of purple in it
and also don tipping down at seven seeds
[SPEAKER_20]: in Williams, Oregon He does an amazing
job, too We took some breeding classes
[SPEAKER_20]: down there when me and my wife lived in in
Williams in the early 2000 Those guys all
[SPEAKER_20]: have great good quality seeds down there
and I highly recommend it for sure
[SPEAKER_20]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thanks for the share Tom.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great I you know all this talk of
heirloom tomatoes When I had my gallery
[SPEAKER_06]: the melting point gallery and I decided
hey, you know like I wanted to build this
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful gallery with this beautiful
vapor lounge where you know something that
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hadn't seen in the cannabis space
where it was like let's build something
[SPEAKER_06]: really beautiful and And no one even
believed it was a cannabis lounge when
[SPEAKER_06]: they would come in They thought it was
like a jewelry store or something because
[SPEAKER_06]: I put these beautiful hardwood floors in
these cherry wood floors and Japanese
[SPEAKER_23]: chair some of the seeds that we
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's some these are straw flowers,
this is just a huge tote we have like
[SPEAKER_12]: three totes of just pollinators that we
garden seeds just pollinators just the
[SPEAKER_12]: ones that you want to intermix with all of
your cannabis and all of your Fruit and
[SPEAKER_12]: your veggies that are sweet or things that
get attacked in your garden.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll marry Gold's This is all what we
gathered from last year So we're gonna
[SPEAKER_23]: have You know, basically our whole entire
property is gonna come alive with flowers
[SPEAKER_23]: petals.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome We just find that
everything gets so incredibly healthy When
[SPEAKER_12]: we're planting pollinators and it's
beautiful, too We were getting species of
[SPEAKER_12]: birds even this spring that we've never
seen before well that we just saw last
[SPEAKER_12]: year that seemed to come into our farm in
the summer and we're just wondering if
[SPEAKER_12]: they sort of told each other where to come
back to and Already we're starting to see
[SPEAKER_12]: insects.
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to remind everyone part of
growing a garden is to save the seeds So
[SPEAKER_23]: the garden is the source of the seeds for
next year Yep, so you're acclimating your
[SPEAKER_23]: own seeds Yes You'll really see a
difference after one year of growing seeds
[SPEAKER_23]: on your property and saving them by next
year.
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll see a noticeable difference and
also If you plant the seed in the soil
[SPEAKER_23]: that is on your land the seed is going to
be stronger the plant is going to be
[SPEAKER_23]: stronger and you will It'll it'll
recognize if it can climatize to your area
[SPEAKER_23]: once it does and it will build The
bacteria and the fungi within the cells in
[SPEAKER_23]: order for it to really thrive and provide
its medicine so right now we're Being able
[SPEAKER_23]: to benefit from a winter's worth of soil
building now all the seeds are just gonna
[SPEAKER_23]: just dig in To the soil and create
medicine because the seeds actually have
[SPEAKER_12]: the microbiome of the soil that it came
from and then when it continues to uptake
[SPEAKER_12]: that same microbiome, which is the
endophytic system, which is the you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: the microbiome of inside of the plant and
just like human beings it acclimate
[SPEAKER_12]: acclimates to the same zone, you know We
we talk a lot about the microbiome of the
[SPEAKER_12]: human being but it's also important to
start bringing up the conversation of the
[SPEAKER_12]: microbiome of the plant because it also
has bacteria and fungi that digest and
[SPEAKER_12]: helps bring up nutrition So it's it's sort
of cool to think about it for for
[SPEAKER_09]: acclimation There's a two kilo bag of
seeds So this has got a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds in it and I've got hundreds of bags
like this Also today is a Pisces Moon.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a really beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the new moon phase in Pisces It's a
really beautiful time all day today and
[SPEAKER_12]: tonight to just plant as many seeds as you
can Even your micro greens or your sprouts
[SPEAKER_12]: for your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be really vigorous if you plant
them today Get them cracking crack a
[SPEAKER_06]: lacking Wow, we've been rocking this for
what nine ten eleven two and a half hours
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty good went by quick today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have to deal with the lot Live
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of nice to to do the show not
live even though I know a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: are kind of bummed out because it's nice
to have them as well the audience and
[SPEAKER_06]: being able to Somehow help the
conversation along, you know often they'll
[SPEAKER_06]: be able to ask questions and lead the
conversation But that was not the case
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is what it is lots of seeds I know
where I'm gonna get my seeds if I need any
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just gonna be sending a couple of
private messages When you re-upload this
[SPEAKER_24]: dude as a premiere and then people can
talk in there as they're in house church
[SPEAKER_24]: as it's going That's how I do some of my
videos.
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah as a premiere and then people can
talk all the way through it They won't be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to talk to us, but they can talk to
each other You can talk to each other and
[SPEAKER_24]: you can jump in there too and say hey,
we're gonna be in the premiere It's it's
[SPEAKER_24]: another way of being able to talk to
people well And this is well jump in and
[SPEAKER_04]: say we need a germplasm Institute for
North America For our cannabis genetics so
[SPEAKER_04]: that they can be acclimated so that there
are regional grows that are around the US
[SPEAKER_04]: and Canada that are growing on certain
longitudes and latitudes Because when I
[SPEAKER_04]: used to order my hemp back in Hungary and
Romania I was actually knew exactly what
[SPEAKER_04]: the output of this compote seed exactly
what we were growing had because they were
[SPEAKER_04]: actually grown in proper Institutes that
were properly acclimating it so I could
[SPEAKER_04]: maximize You know the fiber that I was
trying to get out of the actual hectares
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's real projections that I
needed to have and if you don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: proper acclimated seeds Right out the
gate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not gonna get the reality that
you're searching for, you know And that's
[SPEAKER_04]: a reality that is different from what
we're doing here in America because we
[SPEAKER_04]: were growing 300 to 400 seed per square
meter which is not how we're doing it here
[SPEAKER_04]: because we have the machinery in Eastern
Europe to break that hemp down where we
[SPEAKER_04]: have absolutely none of that
infrastructure or Large-scale dunking tap,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know tanks for you know, redding the
hemp etc, etc so I'm very fascinated to
[SPEAKER_04]: see as the hemp industry grows throughout
North America Actual investment in the
[SPEAKER_04]: infrastructure that will be needed but on
top of that germplasm Institute needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: be there just for the start of this before
any of that can really take off So people
[SPEAKER_04]: can have good steady supply because we're
gonna see cross-pollination Ruined seed
[SPEAKER_04]: crops because it's going to increase THC
and hemp that's just the reality of what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're gonna see as well as we're gonna see
the reverse in you know people growing
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors for you know Cannabis for their
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are real realities.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to you know, look at and face and
I understand why a lot of people are going
[SPEAKER_04]: towards CBD because it's easier to just
You know shake the flowers as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: invest in the billions of dollars needed
for a fiber factory to cottonize the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: to make it into a product that could go to
a market to manufacture a product that
[SPEAKER_04]: Consumer could get today.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's decades away still Sure Yeah,
there's a group I met from Saskatchewan I
[SPEAKER_06]: believe and his father had invented some
technology to it had to do with trees and
[SPEAKER_06]: the and the what was inside trees and I
can't remember if it was the length or the
[SPEAKER_06]: Percentages or he had this technology and
then years and he was very successful with
[SPEAKER_06]: this technology and then years later he
tuned it to Cannabis to hemp for fiber and
[SPEAKER_06]: now they're doing this big fiber project
and I know Martin Muravchik who was one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the founders of Manitoba Harvest to spent
the last five years trying to crack the
[SPEAKER_06]: economic viability of fiber production in
hemp and I know Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh You're muted.
[SPEAKER_22]: I I could speculate mark on what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure Yeah, so it's probably just having to
removing removing the lignin efficiently
[SPEAKER_22]: from the cellulose So they have to do that
in wood in wood.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot more lignin than there isn't
in hemp, but it's the same type of process
[SPEAKER_22]: to basically pulp You know, I'm not sure
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some other like type of No,
it was some type of like x-ray or like
[SPEAKER_06]: photograph of the of the lumber that they
could he could figure something out and he
[SPEAKER_06]: He was tuning it to hemp to figure out to
grow these fibers that you can't really
[SPEAKER_06]: see with the naked eye But when you do it
with this machine You get an idea of the
[SPEAKER_06]: quality from the data points of the photos
something like that It reminded me much of
[SPEAKER_06]: what the guys from Carnegie Mellon
University were doing the robotics
[SPEAKER_06]: division the AI division where they had
developed that camera to photograph buds
[SPEAKER_06]: and they were taking all of these
different data points and they were trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to Basically recognize when the plant was
in peak production of say THC like a
[SPEAKER_04]: single Well how you read also depends on
what type of fiber you're gonna come out
[SPEAKER_04]: with I mean I remember Gardella has a
machine that could actually remove the
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber from the hemp wet But the problem is
still the lignin in between so In Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean for Hungary we would soak the hemp
and these large concrete tubs so that the
[SPEAKER_04]: natural biological would eat away the
lignin and then we would come away with a
[SPEAKER_04]: very golden fiber if we water ready Right
if we field readed it and just let it lay
[SPEAKER_04]: out in the field It would turn gray and
that's how a lot of the Polish hemp was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the natural bio light correct,
so it's just all about What you're trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to come out with a final fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted a light golden So we had to
force soak it to actually water read it to
[SPEAKER_04]: do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, you know that infrastructure is
there and they can actually keep it and do
[SPEAKER_09]: it currently Hungarian breeders also bred
varieties of hemp which had much more gold
[SPEAKER_06]: than fiber correct We'll have to get Rob
and Amir on here one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got their hemp boutique company
They've done a little documentary.
[SPEAKER_09]: I lived it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I Lived in Hungary off and on I was deeply
involved with the Compotee research
[SPEAKER_09]: station, which is where compote was
developed by dr. Ivan Boksa, who was a
[SPEAKER_09]: good friend of mine I told him I taught
him how to breed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: He taught me how to breed industrial hemp
Surprisingly that doesn't surprise me
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because that's what we use the
Compotee genetic and because of the golden
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as its Availability after we water
readed it to still maintain through them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a great crop And yeah,
love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the world's foremost hemp breeder
until he died in 97 Did you know Goro
[SPEAKER_05]: Borodko from the Institute of Ass Fibers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was he in Yugoslavia?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in the Ukraine in
[SPEAKER_06]: We met Goro Borodko because we flew him
from Kiev to Manitoba to our hemp shop
[SPEAKER_06]: called the hemp exchange in like 91 or 92
or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have been 90 No, it probably
would have been that that 94 maybe That
[SPEAKER_06]: sounds right and we brought he brought a
couple of his farmers and they this was
[SPEAKER_06]: the beginning of us importing the four
tons of Zola tonosha 11 and 13 into
[SPEAKER_06]: Manitoba to grow our first experimental
hemp field in over 73 years was I don't
[SPEAKER_09]: want to criticize the Ukrainians,
but They're notoriously broke and oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah Dude they couldn't put fuel in their
tractors They tried to sell me hemp until
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent a rad meter and it went Well,
we brought seeds over fine and it you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, it started it kick-started a big
part of Canada's you know, the whole grain
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp grain, you know as a food as a as an
oil and as a protein powder all of those
[SPEAKER_06]: things were really kick-started with Zola
tonosha 18 was it was that the Chernobyl
[SPEAKER_22]: strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the OG Chernobyl Well funny enough
that's our Chernobyl that's how that's how
[SPEAKER_06]: we found out about hemp as a
phytoremediative product in Canada through
[SPEAKER_06]: those farmers that were tobacco farmers
and that's how that Chernobyl actual in
[SPEAKER_06]: Chernobyl growing hemp project got started
right, but you gotta wonder Marcus like
[SPEAKER_22]: did all that oil that oil from those
plants make it into Products, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was experimental in 94 95 96 97 Canada
didn't change the law till 98 when it
[SPEAKER_06]: became Commercial and now you could do
stuff with it before that like there was
[SPEAKER_06]: no squeezing seed or there was just
destruction and so they were tripping out
[SPEAKER_06]: because they had to test their Tobacco
field I guess from the radium 226 that
[SPEAKER_06]: they spray on tobacco Which is a
radioactive nucleotide and does definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: register on one of those little dagger
counters their field was way too low And
[SPEAKER_06]: they had no idea at first that because it
was the first time they ever grew hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: ever They just I don't think could believe
that the hemp was that phytoremediative
[SPEAKER_06]: that it was that that it could pull that
much up that would make a Large noticeable
[SPEAKER_06]: difference, you know kind of freaked about
actually because now they had hemp that
[SPEAKER_06]: was like You can't just throw it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like Rules you have to follow you
heard what Sam I was wondering if you have
[SPEAKER_04]: heard of anybody I had heard right after
Fukushima that they were gonna try and do
[SPEAKER_04]: some remediation using Hemp in Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard anything regarding that?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I heard they did it in the Ukraine,
but I haven't heard anything about Japan
[SPEAKER_09]: Here here's some mutant seeds that are as
big as peas.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're 12 to 1 gram What kind of cultivar
is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me I'm trying to get it in my
camera Well, you're not doing very well
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say pull it back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go Those are huge Yeah,
the average seed like a scone seed is 50
[SPEAKER_09]: 60 to 1 gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are 12 to 1 gram Don't you have like
the little ones that are like a hundred or
[SPEAKER_06]: 200 or something?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're 800 800 those little Nepali
seeds They're not Nepali I got them in
[SPEAKER_16]: Kashmir Make better like hemp oil or
better food product with the seeds larger
[SPEAKER_09]: I got them because the smallest seeds I've
never seen in my life So those would be
[SPEAKER_09]: great those look like like peanuts,
oh, yeah the big ones yeah, you can shell
[SPEAKER_16]: them and then it's like a pinion Yeah You
can grow those for a food product or
[SPEAKER_16]: what's the those THC?
[SPEAKER_09]: THC I bred them for five years and made
them almost THC free nice nice What's the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid content of it then CBG There's
a little bit of TB CBD and THC be but to
[SPEAKER_09]: be honest what I did for five years was I
bred all cannabinoids away from it because
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured if it had the ability to make
any cannabinoids it might also make some
[SPEAKER_09]: THC even though the papers weren't
published until recently that show that
[SPEAKER_09]: most CBD synthases can produce about a 25
to 1 ratio of THC whether you want it or
[SPEAKER_17]: not What about the terpene profile a
little better?
[SPEAKER_09]: Terpenes were really really interesting
You could find individuals that smell just
[SPEAKER_09]: like Afghan hash and you could find ones
that smell pretty much like Thai weed
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, some of the type four plants have
less leakage because they don't have a CBD
[SPEAKER_16]: synthase gene So that there's still some
THC, but it's usually like a hundred or
[SPEAKER_16]: two hundred to one Presumably coming from
the other residual cannabinoid genes are
[SPEAKER_09]: so floating Right, I know CBD does it We
didn't understand the exact mechanisms
[SPEAKER_09]: when we bred the world's first high CBD
variety in What was that in the late 90s?
[SPEAKER_09]: but the end effect is still the same that
It was coming from someplace and and I
[SPEAKER_09]: wouldn't be surprised if a few of the
other ones like CDC can also Do similar
[SPEAKER_09]: things?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's our CBG though with CBG in
there or CBGA, I guess Well, if you've got
[SPEAKER_09]: a real CBG variety, you might be able to
stop it all at CBG but Easier way to do it
[SPEAKER_09]: is to find a mutant variety that won't
even make CBG Then the entire cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: train is stopped and you've got a true
no-void variety Does it make a little bit
[SPEAKER_22]: acid which is the thing that makes CBG?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's What it is is it's the CBG synthase
that is Not performing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's a livatolic acid cyclase and
and Nelson that pathway.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah It's the geraniol allotivic acid
transferase I think that's what it's
[SPEAKER_22]: called GT right and Mixed around the
literature.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there's some debate over what to
call it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, some people call it GOT others I
think are calling a live attack a little
[SPEAKER_16]: like acid cyclase but Yeah, let it
literally a little bit messy on there.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, it glues on that GPP on to live.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all right Right.
[SPEAKER_22]: So Sam if I'm just wondering it can you
back up the pathway?
[SPEAKER_22]: all the way to that like I know that I
can't believe the varieties that I see I
[SPEAKER_22]: saw this one guy who's got a variety now
that's got 14% CBG there's about it's less
[SPEAKER_22]: than a percent of CBD but no THC at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: No 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah The rest of the world has finally
caught up to you Sam.
[SPEAKER_22]: What can we say?
[SPEAKER_22]: But so I'm wondering can you go can you
back it up?
[SPEAKER_22]: even a step before that produces no CBG
Yeah, so that does it produce allotovic
[SPEAKER_22]: acid?
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the tripping levels are higher.
[SPEAKER_16]: I we haven't done enough research Yeah,
the GPP is competitive in the terpene
[SPEAKER_16]: synthase pathway So if you knock out the
ability to conjugate GPP to a livatolic
[SPEAKER_16]: acid, it's gonna end up getting used and
shunted over in the terpene pathway
[SPEAKER_16]: particularly I think I think the mono
terpenes are it's it's usually I think
[SPEAKER_16]: it's a different I think it's FPP on the
on the sesquiterpene so the mono terpenes
[SPEAKER_09]: are all sucking up GPP I just don't like
the mono terpenes I like anyway.
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any interest in looking at a
livatolic acid as a cannabinoid or not as
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabinoid but or I guess allotol because
it would decarboxylate right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, people claim that's uh, it's kind of
a rescue man for too much THC.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how true it is Oh really?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if you dose people with livitol it
will bring down their high but uh,
[SPEAKER_16]: that's Sam do you know about that?
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never done it myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would Sam ever know about anything
that brings highs down?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's outshorting that stock.
[SPEAKER_22]: He knows what to avoid, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like I've spent my life working in
the other direction.
[SPEAKER_22]: Olivitol is essentially kryptonite for Sam
That's why we did the terpene so much
[SPEAKER_09]: because they can potentiate and modulate
the effects of THC and that's what I was
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really curious about the friend of
yours Mark that has a CBG plant that has
[SPEAKER_16]: residual CBD instead of THC because I
haven't seen that yet and that might have
[SPEAKER_16]: a different genetic thing that we learn.
[SPEAKER_16]: What we typically see is a little residual
THC but but much lower than like a CBD
[SPEAKER_16]: line because the CBD synthase gene is gone
in those plants so that thing can't leak
[SPEAKER_16]: on you but we think like Sam said it might
be the cannabichromine genes that are
[SPEAKER_16]: still there leaking some THC and there's
some plants have that that that's a two
[SPEAKER_16]: mega base region in the plants that is
missing in some plants and present in
[SPEAKER_16]: others, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's probably a way to breed away
the cannabichromine cluster.
[SPEAKER_09]: The group in Dortmund they originally
found this out five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_09]: eight years ago and they published about
CBD producing THC in a fixed ratio but
[SPEAKER_09]: they were only looking at either one of
the synthases or they were looking at a
[SPEAKER_09]: particular suite of them so it could be
that some of them only doing it you know
[SPEAKER_09]: five to one or fifty to one.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah there's a good paper from Zirbel on
this where they did site-directed
[SPEAKER_16]: mutagenesis on the enzymes I should say in
the DNA construct of the enzymes put them
[SPEAKER_16]: in the yeast so there was only one
cannabinoid synthase gene per yeast and
[SPEAKER_16]: then measured the ratios and it's a really
good paper that shows like which parts of
[SPEAKER_16]: THC synthase and CBD synthase like when
you mutate them what artifacts do you see?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they have all of the CBD synthases?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know people knew there was
how many exactly there are.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they started with the canonical
one that's an NCBI has like an EE number
[SPEAKER_16]: on it and then just mutated from there and
a lot of the variations that they find
[SPEAKER_16]: that do impact the yield we've not seen
naturally yet in the sequencing that we've
[SPEAKER_16]: done across those genes so but they do
give us an idea of what parts of the
[SPEAKER_16]: enzyme like are really sensitive to
glycosylation signals or sensitive to you
[SPEAKER_16]: know other types of.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're shown theoretical synthases.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not representative of what's in
the marketplace it's just kind of like
[SPEAKER_16]: what areas of this gene can we break and
maybe change the ratio but in all cases
[SPEAKER_16]: the enzymes were promiscuous and that they
did not produce a pure single cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_16]: They had THC synthase produced some
background and CBD synthase as you said
[SPEAKER_16]: had like a 23 to 1 ratio of CBD to THC but
maybe there are natural ones out there
[SPEAKER_16]: that are mutated in such a way that they
actually expand or compress that ratio and
[SPEAKER_16]: that's something that I think we got to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The work that was done there at Dartmouth
where they first found this I contributed
[SPEAKER_09]: I think six or seven or eight different
kinds of CBD so that they could find more
[SPEAKER_09]: versions of synthases.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh cool yeah yeah there's definitely a lot
of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have I think there's over 222 mutations
in THC and CBD synthase alone that are on
[SPEAKER_16]: the SNP chip that we're building and those
are just from naturally derived plants.
[SPEAKER_16]: No mutagenesis done in them so there's
plenty of variation out there on those
[SPEAKER_16]: genes.
[SPEAKER_16]: We just don't have good connections to
what those variations do to the chemotype
[SPEAKER_16]: because we're not always getting chemotype
information so if you guys ever find
[SPEAKER_16]: something that breaks the 25 to 1 rule of
CBD to THC coming off of a CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_16]: plant call us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll sequence it instantly and see if we
can find anything in those genes that
[SPEAKER_16]: might be predictive of USDA compliant
hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you tried grace the variety GW uses?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that we have access to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay well it's a shame because I strongly
suspected breaks it but I don't have proof
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I did.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah Etzion probably has that data I would
I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure he's studied it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going deep down the rabbit hole there boys
I appreciate that it's nice it's good.
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have any varietals that are CBG
high CBG varietals that are high in
[SPEAKER_23]: terpenes because the ones that are out
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's high in terpenes like three to five
percent two to three percent?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like on a flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you asking me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah sure you were the one that said that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah I think three to five percent
definitely is the the traditional upper
[SPEAKER_09]: limits whereas of course they they can be
bred specifically for like the folks had
[SPEAKER_09]: it in April and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're 10 percent and people are
reporting even higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen it yet myself.
[SPEAKER_23]: Most of the CBG that's out there now is
low low terps so it's you know it's not as
[SPEAKER_23]: good of a smokable hemp type thing as the
as the high CBD varietals that are high
[SPEAKER_23]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually the best smokable is high THC
believe me.
[SPEAKER_23]: I like the one to ones or the many to
many.
[SPEAKER_23]: I like the equal equal parts.
[SPEAKER_23]: Double click to enter full screen mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right here we go Mark's laying it
down.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah I think that it's high high terpene
CBD is is really evolving and I think CBG
[SPEAKER_15]: is just just slightly behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBG herbs.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah I can't find the the particular one
I'm looking for but I'm just looking on
[SPEAKER_22]: his Facebook.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the dude Matthias and he's a he's
a Swiss guy who's in the north of Italy
[SPEAKER_22]: but he has a seed production operation
somewhere in Oregon now.
[SPEAKER_22]: Is he connected to Shanti Baba?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at all?
[SPEAKER_09]: No I know these folks and yeah they have a
high CBD variety called I forget the name
[SPEAKER_09]: of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to buy some of them but they
wanted minimum orders of fairly large
[SPEAKER_09]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah well anyway this is the guy and he
does have this isn't the data that I
[SPEAKER_22]: remember seeing.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is just again indicative of the
levels that he's seeing here which is
[SPEAKER_22]: pretty damn high.
[SPEAKER_22]: He had a bag on his on his post here of
CBGA hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never seen CBGA hash before.
[SPEAKER_22]: It looked really light Sam.
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me see if I can pull that up.
[SPEAKER_09]: By light you mean the color or the dark?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah yeah let me stop sharing and let me
let me look let me look for that and see
[SPEAKER_22]: if I could find it.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it clear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it golden?
[SPEAKER_22]: I just looked at myself.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on hold on let me let me see the
picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: The photograph I saw it was dry sifted
hash not water hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey Mark in upstate New York we're making
some CBG dry sift and it's coming out
[SPEAKER_15]: pretty light in color.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you guys typically see that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you tend to see more cannabichromine
than THC in these lines?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's that's kind of a that's an
interesting ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very light hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it looks like white sand almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You Richard Rose and Turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an interesting dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: 40% CBG boom.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sovereign fields and phytonics have if I'm
saying phytonics.
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's 0.3% I think he might just be
saying that just to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you Sam could get that 40 up to a
solid 75.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's nice looking stuff though eh?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to try.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have confidence in you Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd put my money on you.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey Mark I commented down here because
he's like CBG hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: I said actually CBGA.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the that's the pothead
chemists version of like grammar.
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually it's there.
[SPEAKER_22]: Not there.
[SPEAKER_22]: What would be cool is that I guess I'll
assume that when you heat up CBGA it
[SPEAKER_22]: decarbots.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like THC would.
[SPEAKER_09]: So absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay so does CBG have a psychoactive
effect that the CB1 receptor do you know
[SPEAKER_22]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: No no not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And CBG doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBC doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_09]: THCB doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there are people who claim that they
take CBD if they get psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well it ain't high.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's maybe calming or lack of paranoia.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it ain't.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't get you high the way TB and the
right person get you high.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right right.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well that's not true.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBN will get you loaded and delta 8 THC
will also get you high.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not so sure that delta 8 isn't
just an artifact of laboratories.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen a delta 8 synthase and I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_22]: So delta 9 is what's made in a plant and
then acid catalyzed isomerization is what
[SPEAKER_22]: happens to move it over to delta 8.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm convinced but I keep
hearing other people tell me that no we
[SPEAKER_09]: found delta 8 in the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of lab?
[SPEAKER_22]: Read Mishulam's paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mishulam covered this.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah and you've read Mishulam's papers and
I've read Mishulam's papers and what I can
[SPEAKER_22]: tell you is that in his discovery work in
fact oh I should tell everybody this.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wrote an article for the American
Journal of Endocannabinoid Medicine which
[SPEAKER_22]: is Jehan Marcoux's new journal and they
want to dig deep into the history of
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabinoid chemistry.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to write a few more articles
for them but it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_22]: What I found out again is that that group
in Cambridge at the end of the century in
[SPEAKER_22]: the 1890s were the first ones to isolate
not just cannabinol, not just CBN,
[SPEAKER_22]: but the isolate THC as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that extra fiddling wood?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have never guessed.
[SPEAKER_22]: And check it out what I recently read in
someone else's paper.
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't include this in my own but what I
recently read there's that paper that's
[SPEAKER_22]: talking about the conversion of CBD over
to CBN using iodine and it was an Italian
[SPEAKER_22]: group and the first author on the group
was Polestro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah I found it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah on that paper check out the
acknowledgement to Wood Spivey in this
[SPEAKER_22]: Easter field.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the research that they did they found
that both Wood and Spivey perished and I
[SPEAKER_22]: thought I had heard that one had gotten
malaria and that's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_22]: One actually perished in a lab explosion.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it was Wood who died in a lab
explosion.
[SPEAKER_22]: They were trying to nitrate THC to make
nitro cannabinol and in that experiment I
[SPEAKER_22]: think he exploded.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the other guy, so not Easter
field, but Wood Spivey in Easter field.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think Spivey's the guy who died in
the explosion.
[SPEAKER_22]: Wood died from basically taking too much
of the shit that they were making.
[SPEAKER_22]: They were making all kinds of derivatives
in their lab and he ended up poisoning
[SPEAKER_22]: himself.
[SPEAKER_22]: Easter field was the professor that I
think they were working for.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're harsh ministers.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah there was a rumor that he also too
had perished but it turned out no he he
[SPEAKER_22]: had actually made it out of New Zealand
alive and yeah so it was interesting what
[SPEAKER_22]: happened to that those those three people.
[SPEAKER_22]: But they published two papers in the 1890s
one in 1896 and one in 1899 and damn if
[SPEAKER_22]: they weren't like the real true pioneers
who first isolated cannabinoids and and
[SPEAKER_22]: they in their paper one of the references
they have is back to some journal of
[SPEAKER_22]: pharmaceuticals from 1850 something and I
can't find that reference.
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't even find the journal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send me the name and I'll tell you if I've
got it by any chance.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah I think it Sam I think it was some
German article or something like that
[SPEAKER_09]: because I have quite a few papers in both
German, Italian and other languages.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't read but I can type them into
Google because they're not digital they're
[SPEAKER_09]: just scanned the journals you know.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is like this is like contemporary
with the discovery of the light bulb these
[SPEAKER_22]: guys isolating THC in this lab in
Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_22]: To me just way ahead of their time I mean
this is you know way before Adams and Kahn
[SPEAKER_22]: and so yeah so my next article I'm going
to write about Kahn Robert Sidney Kahn who
[SPEAKER_22]: kind of looked at the wood Spivy and
Easter Field work and said you know what
[SPEAKER_22]: their formula isn't quite correct and
their structure isn't quite correct and
[SPEAKER_22]: and Robert Sidney Kahn kind of got the
major elements of what the correct
[SPEAKER_22]: empirical formula for cannabinoids and THC
and CBD were so he kind of nailed that and
[SPEAKER_22]: he nailed the structure and again this is
in like 1934 you know way before Adams see
[SPEAKER_22]: Adams wasn't born until later in that
decade right.
[SPEAKER_22]: So then then there was Adams and Todd who
is still this is 20 years before Meshulam.
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's just I love that history it's just
a wonderful what Meshulam had and none of
[SPEAKER_09]: them had was NMR.
[SPEAKER_22]: NMR that's right.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what made the absolute big
difference.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah but you know what in researching the
paper that I just wrote what I also kind
[SPEAKER_22]: of came to the realization was so what he
did is he took hash and he chromatographed
[SPEAKER_22]: it on a silica gel column but then what he
did was he took the fractions that
[SPEAKER_22]: contained primarily THC and he made a
crystalline derivative that he can
[SPEAKER_22]: crystallize to purity and and thinking
back to my academic training as a chemist
[SPEAKER_22]: one of the classes you have is the is the
identification of organic compounds and
[SPEAKER_22]: it's fascinating because back before we
had HPLCs and GCs and and all this
[SPEAKER_22]: analytical instrumentation that we have
now they used to make derivatives and
[SPEAKER_22]: crystalline derivatives were always
popular because you could purify it from
[SPEAKER_22]: all the non crystalline impurities and so
what Meshulam made is he made a
[SPEAKER_22]: crystalline derivative that he could
purify to the purity and then he removed
[SPEAKER_22]: the thing that made it a crystalline
derivative and then further distilled it
[SPEAKER_22]: and so so that way you know that it was
absolutely pure there's no other
[SPEAKER_22]: impurities in there and so so yeah so
Meshulam used again NMR like you say Sam
[SPEAKER_22]: to solve where the double bond was the
thing that miffed Todd and Khan and Adams
[SPEAKER_22]: was the fact that again they were using
derivatization chemistry to identify what
[SPEAKER_22]: the structural components of the
cannabinoids were and in that
[SPEAKER_22]: derivatization chemistry this goes back to
Kevin's original point they were
[SPEAKER_22]: isomerizing it over to Delta A so if you
look at the structures in Adams's work
[SPEAKER_22]: from the 40s you'll see they're all Delta
A configured because a lot of times the
[SPEAKER_22]: first thing they did is well let's hit it
with acid and see what happens and that's
[SPEAKER_22]: exactly how Spivy died they were trying a
a nitration with nitric acid and sulfuric
[SPEAKER_22]: acid that's also the same explosion that
killed Lamont Dupont who was the son of
[SPEAKER_22]: the of EI Dupont the founder of the Dupont
company was killed in a nitration
[SPEAKER_22]: explosion in the Rapano works over in New
Jersey so so yeah man I love chemical
[SPEAKER_22]: history like that it's so fucking cool and
digging into the cannabinoid chemistry
[SPEAKER_22]: because it was kind of like this outlaw
thing that only certain labs did like
[SPEAKER_22]: there was obviously Meshulam who arguably
was the kind of like the Shulkin the Sasha
[SPEAKER_22]: Shulgin of cannabinoid chemistry but just
like Sasha Shulgin Meshulam stood on the
[SPEAKER_22]: shoulders of Adams yeah of Giants right
all the people who came before and
[SPEAKER_22]: Meshulam will humbly like any chemist like
myself will humbly admit that that we were
[SPEAKER_22]: we're here today because of all of these
people who did this previous work so these
[SPEAKER_22]: Brits who were distilling THC back before
the turn of the century they didn't know
[SPEAKER_22]: it but here we are now over a hundred
years later reading their landmark work
[SPEAKER_22]: and and you know what their boiling point
was spot fucking on I mean it was exactly
[SPEAKER_22]: the way it should have been which is the
reason why I believe they didn't just
[SPEAKER_22]: isolate cannabinol they isolated THC in
1896 and it was really for many years
[SPEAKER_22]: thought that because they called it
cannabinol that oh they isolated CBN but I
[SPEAKER_22]: don't think they isolated CBN I think they
isolated THC and I think if you go into
[SPEAKER_22]: Meshulam's paper Meshulam has a wide body
of papers in the scientific literature he
[SPEAKER_22]: references all of this prior work by
Robert Sidney Kahn and Easterfield Wood
[SPEAKER_22]: and Spivey all those people just it's
fascinating to go through the Meshulam
[SPEAKER_22]: portal to kind of rediscover all of that
chemistry just like in the same way that I
[SPEAKER_22]: discovered bluegrass music through the
Olden in the Way record right which which
[SPEAKER_22]: led me to this portal of Bill Monroe
bluegrass that I had no clue even existed
[SPEAKER_22]: right I found it through this portal Olden
in the Way yeah it was one of Jerry
[SPEAKER_22]: Garcia's projects but it was the Jerry
Garcia thing that brought me into it and
[SPEAKER_22]: now I discovered this whole world of
bluegrass music well it's kind of like I
[SPEAKER_22]: knew about Meshulam and I knew about his
important work but I had no clue really or
[SPEAKER_22]: no real appreciation for all the work that
was done in the pre-Meshulam cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: chemistry Meshulam has written very very
good reviews so has Loomis and so has
[SPEAKER_22]: Petrie and yeah Roger Pertwee that's right
all three of them have written fantastic
[SPEAKER_09]: and Meshulam two or three times has
written histories of it have you guys seen
[SPEAKER_09]: that work on cannabimovone that just came
out yes that's what I'm smoking right now
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah we talked about that in fact I
reached out to the guy through Chimera you
[SPEAKER_22]: guys know Chimera right yeah yeah they're
in Italy right yeah so I reached out to
[SPEAKER_22]: the guy through because you would think
Kevin I mean I get I'm just throwing this
[SPEAKER_22]: out there if a lot allotovic acid is its
biosynthetic precursor wouldn't you think
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabimovonic acid would be what exists
yeah it should have the acid group next to
[SPEAKER_09]: the phenolic OH right the other
possibility could be that it's being
[SPEAKER_09]: produced the way THC is produced by CBD
synthases I'm not saying that's more
[SPEAKER_09]: likely I just say there's a slight
possibility well it just probably
[SPEAKER_22]: underwent adventitious decarboxylation and
if they're characterizing the extract by
[SPEAKER_22]: GC obviously it's going to decarboxylate
in the in the in the GC but it would be
[SPEAKER_22]: interesting if they actually are isolating
the that the carboxylic acid of that again
[SPEAKER_22]: I I don't know like like when people are
talking about CBG just to go back to that
[SPEAKER_22]: for a second there seems to be a lot of
emphasis in CBG is this really for CBG or
[SPEAKER_22]: is it the acid and like you said Sam it
decarboxylates just like just like THC
[SPEAKER_22]: would so I'm trying to understand whether
or not the acids are are of you know just
[SPEAKER_16]: differential interest you know it's also
got an interesting five carbon ring as the
[SPEAKER_16]: outside of the allotovic acid so it's not
a typical six carbon it's a ketone right
[SPEAKER_22]: it's got a ketone and it's got a methyl
ketone and methyl ketones can sometimes
[SPEAKER_22]: make a shift base with a with a with a
primary amino group and so sometimes those
[SPEAKER_22]: are like that's a cross-linking reaction
for proteins the chemistry is above me but
[SPEAKER_09]: if it comes from a plant I'm interested
yeah this one they claim it does I don't
[SPEAKER_16]: think they mentioned like what
concentration they found it in this is
[SPEAKER_16]: different from the Italian work that found
THCP a couple no no I understand I've got
[SPEAKER_09]: the paper I've had it for a couple of
weeks yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know they
[SPEAKER_16]: talk about PPR gamma receptors and but I
don't think if I remember correctly this
[SPEAKER_09]: compound was first found she was five or
ten years ago it was yeah and hemp you're
[SPEAKER_22]: right hey Kevin let's talk about THCP just
for a second because I don't think you're
[SPEAKER_22]: on that hash church when we were talking
about that paper yeah so the fact that
[SPEAKER_22]: it's the two carbon higher homolog of the
of the cannabinoids I said well doesn't
[SPEAKER_22]: that make sense that like and I guess the
three carbon one is the is the verin right
[SPEAKER_22]: you have the verin yeah and you have then
you have THC then you have THCP well shit
[SPEAKER_22]: don't you think maybe like there's a
little bit of nine in there and maybe a
[SPEAKER_22]: little bit of 11 so every two carbons
perhaps yeah so do you think that group
[SPEAKER_16]: did Demetrius published this I care or
presented this I can't med this year where
[SPEAKER_16]: they they took THC synthase cloned it in
yeast and fed it different chain length
[SPEAKER_16]: precursors so they gave it hexanoic acid
and got THC out they gave it octanoic acid
[SPEAKER_16]: and got THCP out I think they use a butane
derivative of some sort to get the varins
[SPEAKER_16]: out I didn't I got to go back and look at
his presentation maybe he also put a tenor
[SPEAKER_16]: in there and and and and got a longer
chain length out as well that went out to
[SPEAKER_16]: maybe nine but it was fascinating that the
yeast have no problem making these things
[SPEAKER_16]: so that so the THC synthase doesn't care
it's really happening upstream probably at
[SPEAKER_16]: got or or a livitolic acid cyclase or
prenal transferase I don't know which one
[SPEAKER_16]: is involved with that but it's the last
step of the synthesis doesn't care about
[SPEAKER_22]: the chain length so let me ask a question
this is something I speculated on it I
[SPEAKER_22]: don't know but like if I get a really good
live resin product let's see this one here
[SPEAKER_22]: if I add up my cannabinoids and I add up
my terpene so I have 80% total
[SPEAKER_22]: cannabinoids and 15% so there's 5% unknown
right 5% other stuff don't you think like
[SPEAKER_22]: like part of that other stuff could be
THCP yeah all of them just like a whole
[SPEAKER_22]: family of of things that show I don't know
if I'm using the terminology correctly a
[SPEAKER_22]: lack of of well or promiscuity of the
enzymes act the site to act on a spectrum
[SPEAKER_22]: of substrates as opposed to just the one
yeah yeah no I think so I'm wondering if
[SPEAKER_16]: you can add them as well like how could
you boost production of hexanoic acid
[SPEAKER_16]: versus octanoic acid like is there a way
to do that in the jasmine pathway or can
[SPEAKER_16]: you even I don't even know if you could
supplement them or spray them because
[SPEAKER_16]: they're effectively like alkanes right
they they would effectively melt your
[SPEAKER_16]: trichomes if you spray too much of that
stuff right yeah well the thing that I
[SPEAKER_22]: think is that does this it's hexanoic come
from glucose which is a c6 so it's gotta
[SPEAKER_22]: have it's gotta have a sugar precursor to
it right I mean I don't know this for sure
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah a lot along the Krebs cycle but so so
the question is is like like people have
[SPEAKER_22]: been asking oh man that stuff's 30 times
30 times high or it gets you I guess they
[SPEAKER_22]: did a docking study you know on the
instructor site and they found that it had
[SPEAKER_22]: you know 34 more affinity yeah that's just
a Delta G measurement really I mean so so
[SPEAKER_22]: here's the point here's the long belabored
point I'm trying to make which is that if
[SPEAKER_22]: you look at the entourage effect and if
you assume that okay so in that stuff I
[SPEAKER_22]: got from the dispensary they know what 80%
is cannabinoids 15% serpents there's 5%
[SPEAKER_22]: other stuff right so that other stuff
could have like THCP could go a long way
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah right so so part of that entourage
effect are these smaller amounts of like
[SPEAKER_22]: THCP and who knows if c9 or c11 whatever
you think that there could be something to
[SPEAKER_16]: that you think yeah I mean I guess we got
to figure out what the standards are and
[SPEAKER_09]: how to measure this stuff on HPLC so that
we're not I really disagree because I
[SPEAKER_09]: don't think the amounts of THCP would
amount to diddly-squat it's probably even
[SPEAKER_09]: in the concentrate like you talked about
there's 80% THCP if that's what the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid is and there's 0.001 or less
right right it's so so so maybe but there
[SPEAKER_22]: could what are the other phantom compounds
there's some other things in there that's
[SPEAKER_22]: making up that other five percent no no no
no no all the cats of Pennsylvania they
[SPEAKER_22]: measure all seven I think it's seven maybe
it's nine let's see yeah I think they
[SPEAKER_22]: measure nine different cannabinoids so all
those cannabinoids have been accounted for
[SPEAKER_22]: the terpenes I mean it's a nice saucy
product you saw my socks well but nobody
[SPEAKER_09]: was measuring THCP or CBD THCP nobody was
measuring that before if they were they
[SPEAKER_16]: could be peak under peak on some on the
okay but like I said they weren't
[SPEAKER_22]: measuring yeah yeah see that's just a
point Sam is is that that last five
[SPEAKER_22]: percent of stuff that my state doesn't
test for is really the key differentiator
[SPEAKER_22]: ultimately on why it works so well right
it's the cannabinoids and the terpenes yes
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's a high cannabinoid extract but
you could also be presuming and not be
[SPEAKER_15]: right oh yeah that's a great thing well
certainly murky mark but I think you make
[SPEAKER_15]: a good point that you know that five
percent in terms of of of numbers is a lot
[SPEAKER_15]: and and that's a lot of unknown that you
know it should you know to bring it all
[SPEAKER_15]: there so to speak it's like you know that
five percent you know it might not be THCP
[SPEAKER_15]: but it could be other acids they could
have something that maybe isn't 30 times
[SPEAKER_22]: better but maybe only like five or six or
seven times better right back that it's
[SPEAKER_22]: only there in a fraction of a percent and
maybe there's two or three things someone
[SPEAKER_22]: today was asking online in the chat about
flavonoids and I think in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_22]: low temperature butane extractions I think
a lot of flavonoids come through I mean I
[SPEAKER_22]: wouldn't see any reason why they wouldn't
in fact I think that's the major reason
[SPEAKER_09]: why all this stuff's colored if you smoke
flavonoids it deactivates them so nobody's
[SPEAKER_09]: getting any site site site not getting
high from from smoky but a certain
[SPEAKER_22]: fraction of that five percent of
extractibles is flavonoids like if it's
[SPEAKER_22]: point five or point two flavonoids have
high extinction coefficients which mean
[SPEAKER_22]: they're highly colored so a little bit of
flavonoid can really color it and the fact
[SPEAKER_22]: that most cannabis extracts at least the
things that I see are most likely like you
[SPEAKER_22]: know like this kind of color this kind of
color I mean the terpenes if you isolate
[SPEAKER_22]: the terpenes are all colorless yeah the
cannabinoids should be colorless the thing
[SPEAKER_22]: that's colored here I believe is the
flavonoids I don't know that fruit for
[SPEAKER_09]: fact I just think that the colorized
cannabinoids and oxidized terpenes you
[SPEAKER_09]: have color well at least the oxidization
colorizes them yeah reddish and yellow
[SPEAKER_06]: colors yeah well that was pretty deep down
the rabbit hole not too bad I went a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit past noon but I loved it it's
good just keep talking if you guys want to
[SPEAKER_22]: talk I'm not I'm not opposed well I
haven't spoke with Kevin in a while Kevin
[SPEAKER_22]: it's been a while right where we've both
been on it's like Kevin's been on and then
[SPEAKER_22]: I was traveling one time and I think I've
been on and Kevin takes quarantines
[SPEAKER_22]: unfortunately one of the other we'll get
to a fish show together yeah hey let me
[SPEAKER_22]: shout out the great went post that poster
that's behind you that's that thing's
[SPEAKER_16]: pretty sick yeah reminiscing on some of
their have you heard that podcast of
[SPEAKER_16]: theirs now they talk about the swamp I
remember being at the swamp yeah I can't
[SPEAKER_22]: believe it was yeah yeah I think Marcus
was there Marcus weren't you there no I
[SPEAKER_06]: was not there I think the biggest kind of
big thing that fish ever put on that I
[SPEAKER_06]: went to which wasn't a big thing at all it
just ended up being historic was well I
[SPEAKER_06]: was at the live one the tweezer that they
put on there in Bangor Maine but it was 94
[SPEAKER_06]: Halloween show in Glens Falls where they
did the double white oh the white album
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah I was front row center for that
it was absolutely bonkers so long it was
[SPEAKER_06]: five and a half hours which for 94 was I
think it might have been the longest
[SPEAKER_06]: concert they'd ever played to date that
wasn't like some specialized New Year's
[SPEAKER_06]: show or something you know it was long it
was good happy to be there
[SPEAKER_23]: and then they played the Hilton and Eugene
and that's when I think they start their
[SPEAKER_23]: first bouncing ball and the bouncing
around the room around the room yeah but
[SPEAKER_06]: here's the thing how many Doniac schvices
do you have there you go I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_16]: taught I'm gonna look through my college
stuff I bet I still have some of those in
[SPEAKER_16]: there my wife actually was going over
pictures of Amy's farm she's got a bunch
[SPEAKER_16]: of photos from her Amy's farm days so
Fishman in a wedding dress oh nice yeah
[SPEAKER_15]: Amy's farm was a big deal that was
remember when we used to play chess yeah
[SPEAKER_16]: audience versus a man right yeah yeah and
what else we got here we got they
[SPEAKER_16]: basically won it one time didn't they beat
the audience at one point that was a draw
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah they had a move each night for fall
95 leading up to yeah the run at the
[SPEAKER_06]: garden what year is this this is fall this
might be that my first concert was in 1984
[SPEAKER_22]: and it was like Iron Maiden 77 that's good
86th Boston more than a feeling but guess
[SPEAKER_06]: who opened up for Iron Maiden in 1984 any
guesses oh no no no it was twisted sister
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't even make that shit up that is
tiny tail well I mean pretty much on some
[SPEAKER_15]: like crazy ketamine or something I was
gonna say since you know we're all well
[SPEAKER_15]: quarantined you know there's there's a lot
of musicians out there that are that are
[SPEAKER_15]: offering music up now and I think now's a
good time to support those artists and to
[SPEAKER_15]: support those musicians that are you know
they're they're forced home like all of us
[SPEAKER_15]: but this is you know it's more than as we
all know just like what we do it's it's
[SPEAKER_15]: it's extremely stressful and it's a hard
time for them so if we can go to band camp
[SPEAKER_15]: and I think you know a hundred percent of
board of the proceeds are going to artists
[SPEAKER_15]: right now if we can you know find your
favorite artists and pitch in I think it
[SPEAKER_15]: would go a long way to them speak volumes
to to the fan base out there that still
[SPEAKER_15]: care about music and deep listen to albums
go back to shows and close your eyes and
[SPEAKER_15]: and get into it very good idea it's a
really good time for that you know it's
[SPEAKER_15]: such a good time to get back to putting on
a record and focusing in on it like a film
[SPEAKER_15]: or you know and just kind of being in the
moment with it it's you know we were so
[SPEAKER_15]: distracted with with so much that it'll
it'll you know it gives us a chance to
[SPEAKER_15]: ground ourselves and bring ourselves back
to you know things we enjoy the simple
[SPEAKER_15]: things so if any of you guys are out there
looking for something to do I think that's
[SPEAKER_06]: a really great way to get grounded well
how I'm gonna finish this off through your
[SPEAKER_06]: inspiration Colin is I'm gonna share my
screen and play one of the songs from Neil
[SPEAKER_06]: Young's fireside sessions that he did a
couple of days ago with his wife Darryl
[SPEAKER_06]: Hannah and so I'll thank you all for
showing up I'm gonna do a bunch more
[SPEAKER_06]: hangouts a bunch more has churches so of
course I'll invite all of you guys I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna thank every single person that came
in today because there was literally like
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 of us but I think going on today as
well like one of these artists who's doing
[SPEAKER_16]: a online couch tour skunk sessions check
them out you might be able to catch some
[SPEAKER_16]: of that this afternoon awesome and what's
that Josh and I think we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_23]: another session on Thursday with some more
healing strategies and ways that people
[SPEAKER_23]: can get through and you know educational
series thanks Wade for helping get us
[SPEAKER_23]: connected to you know Jeffrey Hergen
rather and Stacey and everything and we're
[SPEAKER_23]: gonna just continue you know down the path
of ways that we can build our immune
[SPEAKER_23]: system and more plants that we can ally
with and maybe ways that we can you know
[SPEAKER_23]: set up some of the new gardens in order to
you know create some of these healthy
[SPEAKER_23]: things in the future so thank you everyone
today for everything we appreciate you all
[SPEAKER_06]: right Neil's going live here I'm gonna
share my screen you guys are welcome to
[SPEAKER_06]: hang out for it you're welcome to leave
whatever you like but he's going up now
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys can see it yes or no all right
Neil how fucking cool is Neil Young just
[SPEAKER_04]: on a side note he's great he just came to
my dispensary a few months ago him and
[SPEAKER_04]: Daryl they're fucking cool as hell dude
right through this guys long rip the whole
[SPEAKER_22]: time we can't hear him though really I
can't hear him no you can't hear him or
[SPEAKER_05]: you can no no we can't about now hey you
know trying to turn it up it's coming
[SPEAKER_05]: through very quiet
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah Sugar Mountain I know that tune shout
[SPEAKER_20]: out to Puerto Rico who knows how to handle
a crisis thanks a lot guys
[SPEAKER_16]: Adios have a good afternoon guys see ya
peace Kevin take care man
[SPEAKER_14]: it's everyone I gotta go see you guys
peace everyone thank
[SPEAKER_10]: you there's a girl no
[SPEAKER_10]: when you're finding out it's real
[SPEAKER_10]: oh You live on sugar well.
[SPEAKER_10]: With the barbers and the colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't be 24.
And you're even there too soon.
You live on sugar well.
You live on sugar well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You live on sugar well.
[SPEAKER_10]: With the barbers and the colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't be 24.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you stay or leave home?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause you wanna leave the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're finding out how you feel.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're finding out how you sleep.
[SPEAKER_10]: With the barbers and the colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't be 24.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're even there too soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't be 24.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're even there too soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be 24.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're even there too soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
