[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome everybody to Hash Church 3.0,
the bubble hash Rosin episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, the episode will start with me
looking around mildly baffled and
[SPEAKER_10]: confused.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got some people in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just gonna drop the link.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing things a little bit differently
today as we have a whole new panel of
[SPEAKER_10]: people that I have never invited in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's start admitting them in today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say, boys?
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this new method of having you guys
sitting in the waiting room and all I have
[SPEAKER_10]: to do is click admit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, let's admit the OG of OGs,
shall we?
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys ready to share the room with
Skunkman Sam?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Skunkman Sam in the hizzay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw that note from you about 10
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today we're gonna sort of focus on hash
production for the early part of the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably mostly bubble, but we'll talk
about some traditional methods and some
[SPEAKER_10]: mechanical screen separations and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe even a little bit of hand rub and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured you'd be a great sort of OG to
be in the room because I actually invited
[SPEAKER_10]: a whole new fresh panel of people and
we'll get to introducing them here in
[SPEAKER_10]: about a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they all came from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're sort of all up and coming and
some are fairly already substantiated.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're well on their... I've never been
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you haven't, which is unbelievably
awesome, but you don't need to go on
[SPEAKER_10]: Instagram, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never had to sell you a phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's also pretty tripped out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very tripped out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's introduce some of our panelists
here today.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got... Well, we'll start with
Goldilocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's at the top of the... Actually,
let me see if that's correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're at the top of the queue here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know each other from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Briefly having some conversations and you
were one of our customers at Whistler
[SPEAKER_10]: Technology for a WT300, getting into a
little bit more of the commercial aspect
[SPEAKER_10]: of water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to have that discussion as well
once you kind of introduce yourself and
[SPEAKER_10]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get into that talk of is there a
way, the same way... I guess the argument
[SPEAKER_10]: is, can we grow cannabis large scale and
still keep the quality there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Skunkman Sam says yes, only because he's
done it before.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now the next question is, can we still
keep the quality there with hash if we
[SPEAKER_10]: bump up our amounts and we're no longer
doing little hand stirred batches,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we're rocking 50, 60, 70, 80?
[SPEAKER_10]: Kilos of biomass at a time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So introduce yourself, brother.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Mike.
[SPEAKER_17]: I run Goldilocks here in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been making hash for a good amount of
years now.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're kind of more so focused on rousing
now just because we've been doing such
[SPEAKER_17]: large batch.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like you said, we are doing large
batches with the new Whistler Check
[SPEAKER_17]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with Sam that we can do a large
batch and keep the quality just the same
[SPEAKER_17]: as it was with small batch.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's just a matter of using the
right equipment and having the right
[SPEAKER_17]: people running it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you guys aren't just... You
guys are... Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the right priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality always has to come over quality,
period.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever material we're using is
definitely the number one factor.
[SPEAKER_17]: Try to only use stuff that's going to come
out good.
[SPEAKER_17]: And as long as we're doing that,
I have no issues with our hash but haven't
[SPEAKER_17]: come out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the SOPs are important too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's why I've always found that the
most amazing hash makers that I've met
[SPEAKER_10]: over the years have had a background in
cooking and as a chef.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chefs really understand the SOPs of a
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's food safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to cut with this knife with
the chicken and then cut over here with
[SPEAKER_10]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these simple, very simple little
things seem to get the mind of a chef
[SPEAKER_10]: prepared for following steps and not
missing those steps.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I find that, to quote Sam,
which is a hilarious quote because I
[SPEAKER_10]: certainly don't think of him as a
religious man, cleanliness is godliness.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's great if you're using the great
material and you're doing everything kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of...
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got the good tools, but if there's
someone in there throwing that SOP off by
[SPEAKER_10]: not following simple, simple little rules,
I mean, one that blew me away was back in
[SPEAKER_10]: the day when Alec from SC Labs told me
that this oil company had failed,
[SPEAKER_10]: their shatter failed E.
[SPEAKER_10]: coli testing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's like, basically that's some guy
who's made the hash and gone and taken a
[SPEAKER_10]: shit and not washed his hands properly and
come back and dealt with the product.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, I mean, that's disgusting
right off the bat as generally we are as
[SPEAKER_10]: human beings.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why the SOPs, these standard
operating procedures become so very,
[SPEAKER_10]: very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure you noticed when you picked
up a WT300, it came with SOPs of the yin
[SPEAKER_10]: yang, like that thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think it did.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think I used any of the SOPs that
we got.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we just kind of... The Whistler
guys came down, we ran it once with them,
[SPEAKER_17]: and then I think we just kind of winged it
from there, kind of figured out what
[SPEAKER_17]: worked both for us.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will say the best hash guys that I
have right now on the crew do have kitchen
[SPEAKER_17]: experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: The ones that made it through,
and are still working there are all
[SPEAKER_17]: kitchen, have kitchen experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they definitely, I think they'd be
right about that.
[SPEAKER_17]: That definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best hash is actually untouched by
human hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have monkeys doing it here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, hashtag never touched.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hashtag never touched for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks Goldilocks in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're gonna move on over to
Brian410.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gonna get him to introduce himself,
let us know where he's coming from.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear you, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, my name is Brian.
[SPEAKER_14]: I own Best Friend Farms, and I'm coming
out of Maine these days.
[SPEAKER_14]: The last few years shifted back from over
a decade in the Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I've actually focused on classic hash
form.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm thinking that we're doing some
fresh or some fresh frozen into sea,
[SPEAKER_14]: but ultimately anything sticky or balling
up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very strict regimen with living soil
organics.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's I'm really flower first and just
really enjoy live beautiful canvas flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it all comes from that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really about the flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: The new hash platform in the classic
technique or way I'm approaching it is
[SPEAKER_14]: really about personal appreciation for
that type of that form of hash from,
[SPEAKER_14]: geez, my dad.
[SPEAKER_14]: My dad was making hash for Christmas
parties back in the 70s, starting in
[SPEAKER_14]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess it's kind of like second gen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've aware of the other processes I
pressed for.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a rosin pro younger guy named
HaveHash that was pressing some really
[SPEAKER_14]: high end rosin probably five, four to five
years ago, but I've shifted back to the
[SPEAKER_14]: classic form.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know, just attention paid to
the resin more than the tech.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess it's a little different and I'm
looking forward to the new tech coming,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I've just really, we started with dry
resins even first so that the hash maker
[SPEAKER_14]: who's only a year and under me,
which is who's a chef.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a new thing today to click on.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like an art, he's a graphic artist
chef, and we'll just call him Tom.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's really just paid the closest
attention and then learning the resin
[SPEAKER_14]: quality through me, helping him to see it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We breed off the strain and try to feature
our company's work as well through strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also, I want to mention that I kind of
wanted to pay attention to the 40 plus
[SPEAKER_14]: crowd, not to exclude the younger folks,
but I'm already this year myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's funny because the younger folks
are turning a real eye almost sometimes
[SPEAKER_14]: more so on the classic hash form with
really wanting to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as temple ball, as far as even so
we press some blonde, but again,
[SPEAKER_14]: we really focus on full melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the bubble hashing just, it really
turned things for us and going with it,
[SPEAKER_14]: keeping it raw and trying to just keep the
resin as good as we can.
[SPEAKER_14]: And anyway, that's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I love that you're focusing on the
living soil and the flower first.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we, a lot of you won't know this,
but I had from the original Hash Church
[SPEAKER_10]: 3.0 photo I posted on Instagram about
three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had already planned the show,
but in the post I mentioned, hey,
[SPEAKER_10]: and if you know any great hash makers here
on Instagram, I'd love to have you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: tag those names.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where everyone who's going to
be on the show today came from.
[SPEAKER_10]: They all got tagged.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was actually 48 to 49 people who got
tagged.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ended up doing a pre video with
about 20 plus of you, which was a really
[SPEAKER_10]: great video.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll probably notice today as we go
through this that you will hear a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: people say exactly what Brian just said in
regards to the soils, the living soil,
[SPEAKER_10]: that sort of the bacteria, you know,
living microbials and just that living
[SPEAKER_10]: biome in the soil to produce a residence.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, to allow that plant to express
itself in a way that maybe it won't
[SPEAKER_10]: express itself being grown with salt
newts.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're definitely not, you know,
we're not going to spend the show shitting
[SPEAKER_10]: on a salt newt grow, but I definitely
always, you know, put another gold star
[SPEAKER_10]: behind each person's name.
[SPEAKER_10]: As a hash maker and a hash smoker,
if I know that that person is focused on
[SPEAKER_10]: living soils and they're actually,
you know, focused on proper cultivars that
[SPEAKER_10]: are, that are going to be producing
hashish in a way that's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_10]: special than your average, you know,
like I said, another extra little gold
[SPEAKER_10]: star right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for sharing brother all the way
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all the way out in Maine.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get back to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: True hash, true hash company bro is in the
house.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_10]: We can hear you great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, you sound perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Dakota.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm owner of True Hash Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are based out of Auburn, California.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we mainly focus on just
selecting cultivars that are resin rich
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not much of a rosin boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've always preferred smoking
melt, you know, over the years and melts,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the way of the roots these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we just try and stay true
to what we know and what we've learned
[SPEAKER_04]: from, you know, sometimes it doesn't
always work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have your strains that,
you know, make more of a full spectrum run
[SPEAKER_04]: or pull in certain microns that aren't as
melty as others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just really try and focus on
cultivars that pull heavy and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you're 90 to 120 range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just really, that was like our main
goal this season was just finding very
[SPEAKER_04]: resin rich cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a lot of less work and the whole go
around makes life a lot easier,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially if you can produce a very
quality melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, it's a very important journey
that a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's two schools of people and I want
to be very careful because I certainly
[SPEAKER_10]: don't want to get into offending anyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there and I said it when when bubble
hash first came out, people were blown
[SPEAKER_10]: away by it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so new.
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought it was fake.
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought it was a scam.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only people who saw the magic in
it were the people who just happened to
[SPEAKER_10]: have super high quality hash producing
cultivars that they didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone thinks they have great herb,
but I'm telling you, back in the day,
[SPEAKER_10]: I would sell bags to everyone and super
randos would hit me back up from like the
[SPEAKER_10]: middle of Texas or whatever and send me a
picture of like full melt and be like,
[SPEAKER_10]: is this good?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, why does it look wet?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm not sure if I did it right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just like, oh, yeah,
you did it right, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's these two schools of
thought.
[SPEAKER_10]: The person who made six star bubble hash
the first time they ever made bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally, those guys are hash makers.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not looking to create a cultivar
that they're going to make into hash so
[SPEAKER_10]: that they can take it and squish it into
rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to offend people whose trip
is making rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rosin is an amazing product and it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've always just questioned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, if you can get down this pathway and
find that six star, you may be happy with
[SPEAKER_10]: just that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's an enormous amount of cool
things we're going to talk about with
[SPEAKER_10]: rosin that goes beyond and above just
extractions with raccums and covert
[SPEAKER_10]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get in here later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Raccums is in the room right now and talk
about, you know, their THCA separations
[SPEAKER_10]: and their terps slurries and their,
you know, all of these different fractions
[SPEAKER_10]: and how they can be done.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's awesome and amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for myself, I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a special place in my heart as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a hash smoker.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoked it for so many years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Straight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't smoked a joint in 19 years,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't smoked a joint of cannabis in 19
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that was hash that basically ruined
joints for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to move on and we're going to
talk to Taste of Cascadia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scott is in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're happy to have you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you give everyone a little
background again.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're kind of doing a similar thing that
we did in the pre-church video,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, just to be a five-minute or a
little more is no problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go through the list and then,
oh, damn it, Bobby's waiting to get in.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: My guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll let Bobby in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby can come in.
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it, Bobby!
[SPEAKER_18]: A little late, as usual.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I started out probably like mid
2000s, just washing hashes with homies out
[SPEAKER_08]: in the hills of Portland or the country of
Portland, I should say.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we were back then,
we were drying on cardboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the tech because it was a
desiccant or natural desiccant.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, been washing here for years,
everything from getting a little feedback
[SPEAKER_08]: from Bobby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, used to manage a big garden,
a big old OMMP garden and used to process
[SPEAKER_08]: all their trim.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it was processing probably
like 10 to 20 pounds of dry trim back
then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day and really developed
everything from dry trim to fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, most recently been doing everything
single source, like Dakota was saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: basically searching out those good
cultivars that only do good for six star,
[SPEAKER_08]: that crush everything out for both melt,
flavor, the high, the yield and finish
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's another good thing is if it's
done in 56 or around 56 days, it
[SPEAKER_08]: definitely helps out because, you know,
time is money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, most recently, I also started a six
star society, a clothing company to kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of focus on gear to wear while washing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, stuff that doesn't pill up,
stuff that doesn't hold on to dog hair.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and just focusing on that lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I love.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love, like you said, I love smoking hash
and it's my passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that, Scott.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that you're doing a clothing line
called six star.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the idea of of just producing,
you know, it's and it should go for
[SPEAKER_10]: growers as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I have a hard time watching
people go into grow rooms and finger fuck
[SPEAKER_10]: their plants and squeeze the plants and
then and walk by them with cotton shirts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm a macro photographer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going into that plant in a way that
nobody can possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I see all their heads gone,
like just all it is is stocks like this,
[SPEAKER_10]: like in the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no heads left because they've
brushed the plant so many times or the
[SPEAKER_10]: heads are all broken or worse.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just like large fibers,
cotton and like synthetic rayons.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just like, oh, like get that out
of the hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what that's not even taking us
into beneficial bugs, which consume all
[SPEAKER_10]: the bad bugs and then turn them into shit
balls on your on your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, even fans, I mean, extra agitation
from fans that can create more degradation
[SPEAKER_08]: or more need for the trichome to produce a
waxy head, less melty, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Eric Nugshots is a good buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's always been helpful to reference,
talk to him like, hey, have you seen what
[SPEAKER_08]: have you seen?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just just chat hash chat trichomes with
him, because it's super awesome to be able
[SPEAKER_08]: to see his his work and to see that
trichome on a macro level and understand
[SPEAKER_08]: it on on its level on it, you know,
on like Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like super small level.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Super big shout out to Eric for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Taking it to the next level as a hash
maker.
[SPEAKER_10]: Being a macro photographer for me was
essential.
[SPEAKER_10]: Learning about all these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I did have an advantage of having
Sam in my corner and being able to ask him
[SPEAKER_10]: questions and and be a mentor to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, when I started
taking photographs and seeing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a systolic hair or a capitate
stock trichome or a bulbous trichome or
[SPEAKER_10]: all these other sort of anomalies that
exist, exist in the plant, I really
[SPEAKER_10]: started looking at the plant quite
differently.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's helped.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's helped shape my perspective as a hash
maker just from being a photographer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, good point on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And good to have someone like Eric,
who's really at the top of the game right
[SPEAKER_10]: now, taking some of the most beautiful
macro photographs that amazing have ever
[SPEAKER_10]: really been seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Eric.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Scott.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to our sideways boys who aren't
sideways anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were sideways.
[SPEAKER_10]: They came in like this and it was kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like, you know, those guys are so cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can come in upside down for all I
care.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's two of us.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was trying to get it horizontal.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I totally feel I knew exactly where
you were coming from, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heavy ice and Great Lake Greece in the
house.
[SPEAKER_10]: These guys are a big inspiration to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went into more personal stories last
time, which was really we might get into
[SPEAKER_10]: that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sort of was the you know,
you get the profound aspect of,
[SPEAKER_10]: well, how are these guys so passionate?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what led them to to have to find the
best and to, you know, want to grow all
[SPEAKER_10]: their own inputs and want to start
producing their own food.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't you guys do a little
introduction, heavy ice and Great Lake
[SPEAKER_10]: Greece in the house first.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we we focus on natural growing and
we like to think of going beyond just the
[SPEAKER_12]: term organics because it's kind of such a
broad term nowadays.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can imagine, you know, what exactly
does organic mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the amount of products that are
labeled organic nowadays and things like
[SPEAKER_12]: that, it's hard to really
[SPEAKER_12]: compare that to using the things that we
have around us outside in nature,
[SPEAKER_12]: the local herbs, the local the local
plants, the local mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can we can use these things to to
feed the plants and feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really hard to compare the two.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we really like to just we really focus
on beyond organics.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have definitely found with our
resin and the few people that we know,
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's a lot of other people that we
don't know out there that are growing this
[SPEAKER_12]: way, that it really produces amazing,
amazing resin and amazing, amazing hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we we love sun grown resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's another thing that we've noticed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just seems like the sun grown resin
is comparatively from from my experience,
[SPEAKER_12]: like terpier and like I would usually I've
gotten like really transparent hash,
[SPEAKER_12]: we've gotten transparent hash from indoor
resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: But a lot of times when I was washing
indoor resin, it was it was it was it was
[SPEAKER_12]: melty.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was coming out clean, but it wasn't
necessarily coming out fully transparent.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that that's one.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just just certain things we love about
sun grown resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we love hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will rousen the stuff that don't melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we we we that's our focus is on the
resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think for both of us, Aaron will
probably mention this, that our our
[SPEAKER_12]: passion for growing actually really
started on wanting to produce really,
[SPEAKER_12]: really good hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we couldn't really find it and
couldn't find material that produced like
[SPEAKER_12]: really, really good hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like, you got to you got to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did you guys get exposed to really
good hash?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it an Instagram thing where you would
go online and see or were you prior to
[SPEAKER_10]: that, like on on a website or something?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I saw I mean, in in my high school
days, I'm a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm half his age.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in my high school days, I,
you know, I was I got hash and it was
[SPEAKER_12]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it was it was brick hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was, you know, it would clear dome,
but it was not melt, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I always loved it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I always got the high time times
magazines.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was always really passionate about
resin and we would grow like hide plants
[SPEAKER_12]: in my backyard and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I was always really passionate
about the resin and the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was it was it was definitely
Instagram and your YouTube channel and a
[SPEAKER_12]: few other YouTube channels that exposed me
to full melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember specifically the first
the first, you know, thing that I saw,
but.
[SPEAKER_18]: In my case, I think it was your YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was already a medical patient and I had
smoked way more flour than I ever wanted
[SPEAKER_18]: to smoke in my entire life, trying to get
the dose I needed.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had, you know, the BHO when it
showed up and I did a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_18]: for a while and like the bigger dose,
but didn't like the side effects of poorly
[SPEAKER_18]: made petrochemical extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And coming out of a heavy thing,
though, weren't you during this time,
[SPEAKER_10]: Aaron, like wasn't this during your
getting off pharma and losing all your
[SPEAKER_10]: weight and literally switching your life
like 180 degrees?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was a complete turnaround at the
time with everything, my diet and,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, getting out and exercising more
and the cannabis and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost looking for opiate effects from
from cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I mean, I mean, that's why the
extracts were so appealing initially,
[SPEAKER_18]: because, you know, they hit a lot harder
than, you know, taking 10 minutes to smoke
[SPEAKER_18]: a joint or something like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, it was just it was really
watching your YouTube channel while I was
[SPEAKER_18]: buying all the flowers and the BHO.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had a caregiver at the time,
too, that never even gave me one tricum of
[SPEAKER_18]: material.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was I kept telling him, yeah,
I want to make hash like you can.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can buy an ounce of flowers from you,
but not really going to do me any good.
[SPEAKER_18]: So just just from watching you and I knew
that I had to grow in order to make hash,
[SPEAKER_18]: because nobody was going to give me
material.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I even tried to buy material trim and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody was charging me way too
much.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I finally had to grow.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of where the whole thing
started.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll tell you, if you guys aren't
following them already, as you should
[SPEAKER_10]: follow all of these guys will drop all the
Instagram names at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been watching Heavy Icer for some
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just been a joy to watch him like
literally like just go from the sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: non headiest person you could possibly be
to like to like the head.
[SPEAKER_10]: He went from like a 25 micron,
no melt sulfur spray to a living soil,
[SPEAKER_10]: 90 micron full melt, clear dome,
watching the reflection of himself while
[SPEAKER_10]: he puffs it in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like your story.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think you should.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been like, what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like how many years?
[SPEAKER_10]: Has it been?
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't seem like it's been that long.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think I think my first grow was like
2014 or 20.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, 2014, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe 2013.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will get into a little bit more of what
Great Lakes was talking about at one point
[SPEAKER_10]: in time once we've introduced everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's in regards to this beyond
organics.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, with our regular panelists,
Dragonfly Earth Medicine, that's that's
[SPEAKER_10]: their whole trip is to produce your
inputs, because for people that are kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of wondering, well, what is beyond
organic, beyond organic is not opening up
[SPEAKER_10]: an organic farm and then draining the
aquifers for the entire surrounding
[SPEAKER_10]: neighborhood because you didn't plan to
catch water the winter before producing
[SPEAKER_10]: your inputs on your farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to put less in to get more out
is what organic living soil is all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Big Ag is all about putting more
inputs from outside of your farm on each
[SPEAKER_10]: year and getting less out each year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are the sort of things that we're
that we're discussing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, with with Sam in the room,
we all know Sam's history.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's probably, you know, grown a lot more
cannabis than all of us combined,
[SPEAKER_10]: probably even just for one or two of his
his years of his life.
[SPEAKER_10]: He has grown an enormous amount of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think as a hash maker, if you can
have that relationship where you
[SPEAKER_10]: understand how to grow cannabis and how to
choose phenols and how to start sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: looking for things that you know,
like Sam didn't just take cultivars and
[SPEAKER_10]: start making hash and looking for one that
works.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam was breeding cannabis to make a
product that works in the end product like
[SPEAKER_10]: hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's that is also, you know,
I look up to that a great deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew, but I and you know, I never really
grew on the level that I was able to make
[SPEAKER_10]: an effect in, you know, producing hash
producing cultivars, which I also want to
[SPEAKER_10]: talk about at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want us all to share our favorite hash
producing cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very important information for everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know people want to hold on to their
tips and little things like this as this
[SPEAKER_10]: industry becomes more and more real.
[SPEAKER_10]: But sharing is caring and not telling
someone a cultivar that produces hash
[SPEAKER_10]: because you are greedy and a douchebag as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Greedy and douchebaggery.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we won't be doing that today on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be sharing our information,
especially when it comes to cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to move over to two other
awesome dudes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wooksauce Winery and Resin Ranch
Extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are muted, so unmute that button
and let him go first this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no problem, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to see you, Wook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going great, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Hash episode of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're talking about hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, no, I got my start in Seattle
and kind of learned to grow and make cash
[SPEAKER_19]: up there about seven, eight years ago now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's been rocking my own kind of
single source hash for a while and moved
[SPEAKER_19]: down to California about two years ago and
started a Prop 64 recreational brand under
[SPEAKER_19]: Fully Melted and been running big 30 kilo
runs of material through a proprietary
[SPEAKER_19]: machine we've made.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally like bagless system.
[SPEAKER_19]: Been running that for the past couple
months and been.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're pulling clean melt out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to hear more about that for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, we've been we've been trying
our hardest definitely to produce,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, good melt.
[SPEAKER_19]: We entered some melt in an emerald cup and
been putting some melt out on the market
[SPEAKER_19]: as well as rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wet or dry.
[SPEAKER_19]: We do all fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_19]: So luckily I have a cultivation partner up
in southern Humboldt and we grow all
[SPEAKER_19]: greenhouse in two different places in like
Bryson.
[SPEAKER_19]: And kind of Salmon Creek area.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we put all the greenhouse whole
plant fresh frozen all toward our hash
[SPEAKER_19]: material for Fully Melted.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to hear more about your machine as
well down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that's another conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what he's got going on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I keep it pretty.
[SPEAKER_19]: I keep it pretty low key.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just we've been, you know, doing a lot of
testing and a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: just other things to kind of push the hash
game other than just a big machine washing
[SPEAKER_19]: a lot like post production changes and how
we just treat the hash and stuff like
[SPEAKER_19]: that.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like I said, we definitely will have
a conversation about that because this is
[SPEAKER_10]: this is where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're at the innovation part.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, there has not been an
enormous amount of innovation in water
[SPEAKER_10]: extraction almost since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still very much like water and ice
and and cannabis and filtering it through.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know something, whether you're using
gravity like Reinhard Delpius back in the
[SPEAKER_10]: 90s or whether you know or Sadhu Sam's
water extraction secret from back in the
[SPEAKER_10]: day or whether you're using a bag system
or whether you're using, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: like a Delta separation Frenchie unit or
even a Whistler Tech WT 300.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a few other people who I'm
very in a very unique position in all of
[SPEAKER_10]: this because generally if someone creates
a machine or invents a new way of doing
[SPEAKER_10]: it, I'd say nine out of 10 of those people
email me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to have and want to have a
discussion about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm always super down and signed NDAs
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just I'm really excited about
maintaining the melt aspect of hash while
[SPEAKER_10]: running commercial amounts, you know,
being able to get to a point where there
[SPEAKER_10]: should be no reason why we can't scale
this up to a point where the integrity of
[SPEAKER_10]: the wash is not affected.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not it's not rocket science,
you know, resin glands sink in water due
[SPEAKER_10]: to their due to their being affected by
gravity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest factor that I see and I've seen
and I think he can attest to is the
[SPEAKER_02]: cleanliness of the material going in is
kind of the biggest factor and work up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt Mendo with a lot of outdoor
farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely a struggle.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, I mean, coming from kind of my
education background as an economic,
[SPEAKER_19]: so I've always been focused on like,
how can we make bubble hash like more
[SPEAKER_19]: reach the economies of scale so that we
can get, you know, most of the market
[SPEAKER_19]: hopefully smoking like good, clean
solventless resin or at least get them
[SPEAKER_10]: access to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they want to choose it, it's there
for them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's not an exorbitant price like,
you know, one hundred eighty dollars a
[SPEAKER_19]: gram or what.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell you now after taxes that hits home.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was before tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: We hit with Johnny B and I on the last.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two puff Wednesdays ago, we bought a gram
of of rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was it was organically grown from
Whistler and turned into bubble hash in
[SPEAKER_10]: the WT 300 and then pressed into rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: But one hundred and eighty dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was hurting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, my God, I was bummed out with the
black market prices prohibition.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was generally created based on
someone doing 10 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not quite sure how these prices are
according to the legal market,
[SPEAKER_10]: but hopefully they they figure it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure with people like yourself and
with with our own company at Whistler
[SPEAKER_10]: Technologies and others working on getting
this scale problem fixed so you can still
[SPEAKER_10]: pull that quality, that purity,
because that's really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not about quality, but purity.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you make water hash, the purity has
already been produced.
[SPEAKER_10]: The grower and the genetics did that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't make pure quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just purify it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We unveil what is or isn't there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we do as hash makers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why for me, I've always
appreciated the humble hash maker.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one that understands his his or her
place is that, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have some skills and I'm doing a
good job.
[SPEAKER_10]: But my the timeline of me making hash is
very short compared to the timeline of
[SPEAKER_10]: someone growing a three month crop in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine the shit that the grower
had to deal with over three months?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I come in and I process it all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I post it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone's like, oh, yeah,
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: See what he did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: What an amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: As hash makers, we got to stay humble.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like all hash makers got to at
least try their hand at growing,
[SPEAKER_19]: too.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they know they know the the realities
of what that means.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then also, I think it really
enlightens kind of your whole aspect of
[SPEAKER_19]: how to treat material and, you know,
how to process better, how to guide your
[SPEAKER_19]: farmer better on what to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a same idea for people who drove.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought everyone who drove a car should
be forced to drive a moped or a motorcycle
[SPEAKER_10]: for the first year of their license so
they can be exposed to the dangers of
[SPEAKER_10]: driving a car cluelessly, you know,
because when you're in a car, you feel
[SPEAKER_10]: this protection.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when someone's just giving you your
trim and your bud, you're protected.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh, yeah, like, I got all this
coming in over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the whole reason bubble man
became a name was not only because I had
[SPEAKER_10]: access to make water hash before most
people, but because I had access to
[SPEAKER_10]: incredible quality flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had I not had that access, people would
not have thought what they thought about
[SPEAKER_10]: me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I noticed often it was, oh,
yeah, he's got the quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got the quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have a good nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm able to find quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: That certainly doesn't mean my shit
doesn't stink.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it certainly doesn't mean that I'm
better at this than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the whole purpose of teaching people
how to make water hash over the years was
[SPEAKER_10]: that anyone could do it as well as anyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no special, oh, you're a
magician.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, no one can make it as well as
you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, the first couple of years into making
water hash, my mom, who was like worked
[SPEAKER_10]: for the police at the time, came over to
my house.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, I want you to make a batch
of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she like mixed it up and did a five
gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave her the material and we called it
Polly's melt because it came out six star.
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom made six star the first time she
ever made hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she was like the straighties of the
straightie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the genes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the genes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: The plant genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My little spleal since I have a completely
different come up story than this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just live close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have become good friends over the last
few years and do some work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of started out just doing
little grows in Wisconsin in my basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was open blasting stuff and watching
found you on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, shit, you can dab water
hash and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and actually the first hash that
I ever dabbed that was melty was dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention that last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my come up actually as a dry sift
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuban gave me a shout out here on Hash
Church a few years back after I gave him
[SPEAKER_02]: some dry sift at Emerald Cup 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of really what opened the
doors for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one, two Emerald Cups the
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a little problem with coming up
dirty after and got those taken away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was all just a big learning lesson
because a year after that at the Mendo
[SPEAKER_02]: hideout, we ended up getting DEM
certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we completely turned things around at
that spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we were really being dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were only spraying organic at the time,
which, you know, everybody was.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no shame in learning.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate being honest because
people are so fake and shallow these days.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to post the fake, beautiful
Instagram photo with none of the reality
[SPEAKER_10]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost over a third of our crop to russet
mites that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's refreshing to hear you be honest,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I kind of the natural
transition I had been making water hash to
[SPEAKER_02]: and running a big a big farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift just kind of was a lot harder to
scale up and kind of keep up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of just transitioned over to the
water hash and then naturally fell into
[SPEAKER_02]: the rosin as a byproduct of our runs that
weren't full melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the first the first the first melt I
ever smoked, funny enough, was also sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was in 1995 in Amsterdam at my
first cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: And someone somehow I ended up smoking a
little bowl of skunk man Sam's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll never forget Rob Clark standing
on the stairs of this Thai restaurant that
[SPEAKER_10]: we were at during that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember the Thai restaurant,
Sam, with all the ladyboys as waitresses?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's still there.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this was this was a very strange Thai
food restaurant that had all ladyboys as
[SPEAKER_10]: as the as the waitresses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just a place you could smoke
hash in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: And pot people are cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't give a fuck what people choose
with with their lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was great food.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm hitting this bowl on the stairs
of this restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hear Rob say, if it don't bubble,
it ain't worth the trouble.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I watched the hash melt through the
screen and drip down the stem of the pipe,
[SPEAKER_10]: making me cry a little bit because I was
like, knowing I wasn't going to be smoking
[SPEAKER_10]: that hash that made it all the way down to
the to the rural downstream for for over
[SPEAKER_10]: three years, almost four years.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was three.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to recreate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tried to make that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it wasn't until getting turned on to
water extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I actually made my own product that
melted and bubbled into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I first posted my company,
bubble bags, fresh Hatties and the and I
[SPEAKER_10]: and I chose to use the logo or the motto,
if it don't bubble, it ain't worth the
[SPEAKER_10]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really I had seen Sam and
bumped into him in places.
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was very particular back then.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was very, very strong willed and
minded.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was almost like a professor that was
just so above.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like if you were the best kid in the
class, maybe the professor.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you were like the middle kid in the
class, the professor wasn't talking to
[SPEAKER_10]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was me running into Cuban.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had like, oh, this is Cuban.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the tricep guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to, you know, give him some hash and
see what he thinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have him then chase me down and be
like, bro, do you have any idea what you
[SPEAKER_02]: even have here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I honestly had no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew my hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, imagine Sam's been smoking that for
about 35 to 40 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a lucky guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all noobs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're all noobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really going to change the industry
across the board?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once you've got great quality
genetics that makes hash easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: gives a good yield, and you're growing it
organically or bio dynamically or super
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever way, then what's going to change
the field is automated processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll be able to make the highest
quality continuous operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no longer batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just produce it by the tongue a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now Sam, you'd be the guy to ask
because, you know, I'm not I'm I would I
[SPEAKER_02]: would say from what I've seen,
I'm probably the closest to Cubans
[SPEAKER_02]: cleanliness of dry sift as you're going to
get without being Cuban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that is scalable to that
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know that it's scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: By cleanliness, I presume you're talking
about where the resin heads is 99.9 or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get to 99.9.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the 99.9.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like he truly it's just
resin heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've that's all I've been smoking
for a really, really long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I always called it 99.999% on Sam's
and keep in mind, like no one had seen
[SPEAKER_10]: this product until I photographed Sam's
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to try Sam's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, trust me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the strongest thing I've ever tried
in my life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because there's a difference,
Cuban makes incredible dry sift and he's
[SPEAKER_10]: got a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam's unique because he lived in all the
hashish producing countries.
[SPEAKER_10]: He collected seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: He bred those seeds into hash producing
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: He grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: He made hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the fucking holy grail right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're doing that, you are golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to make a lot of varieties,
which didn't really pan out because either
[SPEAKER_01]: they yielded poor or the resin just,
you know, was it not six star?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I say I say I'm the first guy to say that
I kind of got lucky in the sense that the
[SPEAKER_02]: first thing I ever tried sifting was an
incredible dry sift strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll still say that five, six years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think I would have gotten to
where I got if I hadn't got kind of lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: that first try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should contribute the varieties
that they think make incredible dry sift
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's a resource that the whole
world could actually use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start with number one, DNA sleet
stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a DNA strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a training day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a training day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what the cross is on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I grew out about 20 seeds and
found one that I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up losing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like dry sift from plants,
which you dry and then get the resin off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just look at it funny and they fall
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_10]: You touch it and you're done.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're also growing all bio dynamic
organics, living soil, sand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep on doing that forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've you know, that's pretty much my
style, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to do as much single source as
I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's I have like two or three other
farms that I'll wash for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they all are a KNF, you know,
as closed loop as they can kind of style,
[SPEAKER_02]: not deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody else noticed that bigger
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same clone but grown 12 feet tall
has bigger resin heads on it than that
[SPEAKER_01]: same plant, you know, six inches tall and
flowered off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know how many people have
actually grown 12 footers on this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I will say this, Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have noticed that in certain cultivars
in like Europe and North America.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I've seen quite the opposite on
cultivars like the Mullen Bimbi Madness
[SPEAKER_10]: grown in Australia, grown 12 feet tall to
18 feet, you know, 12 feet tall and 18
[SPEAKER_10]: feet wide from the Mullen Madman.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all the best heads were in the 25 to
45 micron range, which was just on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I couldn't wrap my head around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like it was saying Marcus is
that the if they grow that same plant six
[SPEAKER_01]: inches tall, the resin will heads will be
a little bit smaller than if they grow 12
[SPEAKER_01]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that because, you know,
when we were doing huge plants up at the
[SPEAKER_02]: hideout, my my upper bag pulled like the
150s and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had really never pulled a 150 bag that
had hash in it until we we got up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know, my the majority of
my hash was 150 and 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was up there growing those huge plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, when I first went to visit Breeder
Steve in Lugano around 2000, 2001,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I made hash with his material,
it was they weren't 12 foot tall,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they were pretty big plants that he
was growing in his hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them were definitely like seven
and eight feet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those plants I produced melt from the 190
bag all the way to the 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every single grade melted into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I photographed it while it was wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just that they were all wet on a piece
of paper.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of wrote each micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that photo was published in Red Eye
magazine in 2002, I believe.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it since, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another thing that I like.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we grow cultivars?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because look, we're all looking for the
melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, sometimes we can grow melt between
the 90 and the 120, but we don't see it
[SPEAKER_10]: above the 120.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't see it maybe below the 73.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, big yields come in on those 45
micron bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it always has that very oily,
very specific taste like a 45 micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear I could pick out on and I've done
it like many, many times.
[SPEAKER_10]: From any cultivar made by any hash maker,
you put them in front of me.
[SPEAKER_10]: The 45 is just so specific.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you ever back in the day,
when we were puffing with a flame or a
[SPEAKER_10]: lighter, just gently swafting,
what I noticed about the 45 is that it
[SPEAKER_10]: would take flame.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would light on fire when you were
smoking a bowl of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't, geez, I haven't smoked any hash
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we've been puffing too many
bowls.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even I saw Donji Gil puffing bowls.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll join the panel and puff some
bowls.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to introduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fat spliff that kind of got my
hands shaking a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to introduce A.
[SPEAKER_10]: Simpson is in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's next up to give us a little
background on who he is and what he's been
[SPEAKER_10]: doing with bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Howdy, y'all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can hear you perfect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was so much talked about.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to jump in, but I didn't want to
be rude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So my name's Adam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm stoked to be on here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get weird with some hash talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in Arcata, California.
[SPEAKER_13]: I should probably shout out the gardener
that I work with in her nature on
[SPEAKER_13]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's in.her.nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: You were talking about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always good to give the gardener the
credit that they also deserve.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have so much to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just tell us how you got into it,
what your techniques are, what you're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little bio on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: From there, what we're going to do is
we've got so many good points that
[SPEAKER_10]: everyone's brought up from like,
I want to talk about pre-washing material.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk about drying, desiccants
versus freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just give a little bio.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've still got Bobby and Gil and
Rackham's to go through.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_10]: We probably got till 10, 30, 11 before I
switch it over into the rosin talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, just a little introduction,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, first of all, like back in
2009-ish, probably it was the first time I
[SPEAKER_13]: ever made hash, 2008, 2009-ish.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to think to be on a panel with a bunch
of folks that I can learn from so easily.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll always give rosin makers shit,
even though I love rosin.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that I should bring that up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like a lot of people haven't experienced
the days of buying moldy hash in stores or
[SPEAKER_13]: just having really, really wet hash and
not knowing why or how to dry it properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I take full responsibility because when I
first started making water hash,
[SPEAKER_10]: bubble hash, I was like taking wet bubble
and like rolling it into these Frenchy
[SPEAKER_10]: cannoli balls and people loved it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like shimmering, beautiful,
you know, but I was doing it all wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I only did it for a couple of years before
I realized the massive mistake that I had
[SPEAKER_10]: made.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like I spent the next 10 years
to 15 years trying to tell people not to
[SPEAKER_10]: do that and seeing so much beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was such a shame to see someone who had
great herb, who ran it perfectly and then
[SPEAKER_10]: took it and wrapped and rolled it up all
wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, we're going to get into the
importance of breaking water hash up,
[SPEAKER_10]: whether you're sieving it or whether
you're microplaning it or whether you're
[SPEAKER_10]: freeze drying it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to get the moisture out of your
hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is fairly important.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, if you're doing fresh
frozen, there is a moisture percentage
[SPEAKER_10]: that holds in the wax membrane.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're a macro photography,
you understand that because those balls,
[SPEAKER_10]: those glands look so beautiful,
like a, like a water balloon stretched to
[SPEAKER_10]: its maximum when it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when it's dry, they tend to dry out
and create ripples like a, like a raisin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so these are the sort of differences,
you know, dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why they say dry sifting is not a
misnomer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ideal to have your material dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you can do it with fresh frozen
and some sort of like dry ice material.
[SPEAKER_10]: But to me, that is like the way to produce
the most contaminated low grade hash that
[SPEAKER_10]: you could possibly make.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of people don't realize that
the water is very important in water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as water hash makers, it's really one
of the things that make us look like we're
[SPEAKER_10]: doing a really great job because of that
purity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ninety nine point nine percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think it's easy, try to do it
without the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's there's a very few percentage of
people who can really you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: in the numbers in the amounts still
produce that kind of that kind of product.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why don't we introduce Dammit Bobby
into the room?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to he's on mute right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll share a little bit with us and then
we'll go through Ganji Gill and Rackham
[SPEAKER_10]: and then we'll just have a nice little
maybe a 45 minute to an hour long
[SPEAKER_10]: conversation about all these little points
that different people made up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So try not to lose your point.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've heard someone say something,
sometimes it's a good idea to write a
[SPEAKER_10]: little note, but go ahead, Bobby.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we just jump in if for some reason it
feels like like talking?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, once Gill and Rackham and Bobby have
introduced themselves, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_10]: free for all jump in conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll just get these three introduced.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Bobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple seconds left here before
I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a moment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess we all better take a dab
then, as my good brethren D420K would say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bong rip, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby just telling us to hang on,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gangster straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm his new strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Concentrated X in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give thanks, brother, for producing the
fire all day long on those strawberry
[SPEAKER_10]: banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go by Dammit Bobby on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hash maker originally from Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver,
Washington area now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally started making hash in
Battleground, Washington for a little
[SPEAKER_03]: company in 502 here and then switched to
working for archive down in Portland,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon and selling all of our stuff
through the dispensary there archive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything is is hand stirred.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all single source.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we use all our water there,
all our ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a cold environment that we're
working in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I run ice extract bag,
so bag stack everything from forty five to
[SPEAKER_03]: two twenty in there, the seventy,
the ninety, the one twenty, everything to
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we mix back for rosin grades if
we need to and separate everything for
[SPEAKER_03]: full melt to do to do full melt drops
here, you know, along the road.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We mentioned you mentioned that in the in
the chat the other day, definitely in a
[SPEAKER_10]: very good position.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are washing for archive,
a good friend of mine, Fletch,
[SPEAKER_10]: he's been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: He really knows how to grow and he really
knows how to find those phenos.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything he grows is just fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you mentioned I wash at Burnside
Collective Garden in Portland,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the farm where it all goes down
and then all the material, the flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash, the seeds, everything gets sold
at archive in Portland with dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Fletcher is, you know, is a big part
of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done tons of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon peel, you said, to talk about
strains that you really like to wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one I've been posting lately is his
lemon peel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It washes extremely well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really ever find that terpene
profile that washes really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does, you know, five percent and three
and a half of that sits in the 90 through
[SPEAKER_03]: 119.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're collecting a lot of full melt
when you wash that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was twenty thousand and some change,
like twenty thousand and eighty five grams
[SPEAKER_03]: hand stirred between a few buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing dumps, you know,
five ninety in trays for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, everything else.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're looking at about an 18 percent
yield on that material.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that five percent fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's close to 18 to 20 there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second time I've run this
material here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the materials tends to get
better and better every time as you try
[SPEAKER_03]: and get better when you grow the resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure people know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for those that don't, because it might
be a place where you get confused.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh frozen weighs about one quarter to
one fifth of the same material dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are cultivars that tend to go
towards the one fifth and there are
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivars that tend to go to the one
fourth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that be accurate for you,
Sam, that you've seen over the years,
[SPEAKER_10]: a quarter to a fifth of weight?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to turn my mute on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what exactly you're asking
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm just saying like from a hash
making perspective, if we take a thousand
[SPEAKER_10]: grams of fresh frozen, it's going to be
between two hundred and two hundred and
[SPEAKER_10]: fifty grams dried.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't have a lot of experience
making fresh frozen because the resin that
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the best is actually dried for a
couple of weeks, cured for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then I would stick it in a walk
in freezer and use a centrifugal brush
[SPEAKER_01]: machine on it to make traditional dry set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't really have fresh plants that
were frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I really have the
experience to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for your honesty.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the other hash makers were going like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know I'm on point for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's and that's what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: Five percent fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to end up multiplying that by
about four, maybe a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_03]: With our fresh frozen material,
we take a lot of time to to buck the
[SPEAKER_03]: material down, you know, without touching
the material, you know, and putting it
[SPEAKER_03]: into very small freezer bags and freezing,
you know, tons of these little freezer
[SPEAKER_03]: bags to make sure that there's no pressure
on the material at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, you know, that it's sitting there
with as, you know, as little pressure at
[SPEAKER_03]: all, you know, to keep the heads intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever we do go to wash them,
you don't pull out one huge freezer bag
[SPEAKER_03]: full of material that's got a ton of
weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're offloading a bunch of
really small bags that have between five
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred and maybe a thousand grams.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for sharing that story.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been trying to figure out getting the
dank Duchess in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she's trying to connect now and
she's in them too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I can fit like 40 people in here at
a time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of a new one that I haven't
done a ton of churches with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not the best at doing
troubleshooting, especially while I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: trying to moderate the church.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hopefully she'll make it in on her
audio at least and we'll move forward from
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there she is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, she'd been trying for an hour,
one hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's been trying to get into the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: So welcome Duchess, dank Duchess in the
house.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got we've just got two more people
to introduce.
[SPEAKER_10]: So your timing is actually spectacular.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we have gone to Gil left and we
have Rackham's left and then we're going
[SPEAKER_10]: to get into a nice hash conversation,
which will sort of leech into our rosin
[SPEAKER_10]: conversation here in the next couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Duchess in the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was me doing some other decision.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, no problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to introduce Ganja Gil.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to give us a little lowdown on
where he's at and what he's been doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So give it a go, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you all can hear me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh and Kelly from Dragonfly were letting
me know I was blitching out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried to move closer to my router.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully this is smooth.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, your router in the forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that where your router is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally out of like router, you know,
Trinity County style.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning to everybody, the whole panel
and all the listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel super blessed to be with you all
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just my journey is kind of a
spiritual journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I met Ganja, I was captivated by it
and I just couldn't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've just followed it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's led me, you know, to the end of the
earth, the other side of the country,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it took.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I followed it blindly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to consider myself a Ganja
shepherd, you know, taking care of the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant for the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a deeper meaning for me personally,
you know, and when all the licensing and
[SPEAKER_05]: all the permitting went on, you know,
I'm in the Emerald Triangle, I should say
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm up in Humboldt County,
Trinity County area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ganja country up here, you know,
the baker, the candlestick maker,
[SPEAKER_05]: their mothers, their grandmothers,
their children, everyone is involved in
[SPEAKER_05]: Ganja here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the licensing and the permitting
came, really rocked the culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was kind of devastating for
most.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was always a small time guy doing my
small time thing, but I was just watching
[SPEAKER_05]: my community kind of fall apart and go to
shambles and watching people put all their
[SPEAKER_05]: money on the line and, you know,
go all in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of troubling times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of asked Ganja, like,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I want out of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it just told me to focus on
myself as I always had and kind of just do
[SPEAKER_05]: my own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's always what's been
meaningful for me personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what led me.
[SPEAKER_05]: To living soil and cultivating outside all
this awesome connections I made.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I stopped growing indoors for
personal reasons, not knocking the indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my best friends are indoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me personally, I got into resin
farming, which led to sun grown cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: which led to living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the idea of bringing dirt from
outside into your indoor grow was like
[SPEAKER_05]: always oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed ironic to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we always tried to keep
everything so clean and so sterile in an
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just didn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was reading all teeming with
microbes and all those books.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you know, I just need to
be outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to be growing outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got a little spot, started building
soil, started going out into the national
[SPEAKER_05]: forest and grabbing stuff that was there
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big issue as well as just
keeping the overall cost down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my time to me is just my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it doesn't cost me anything to
cultivate cannabis, then like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel like you could ever lose.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's just so much to be
gained.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always worth the gamble.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got really into living soil and found
the teachings of the lane of Dr. Lane
[SPEAKER_05]: Ingham and kind of got into the microscope
thing for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's really not my thing,
but it was just cool to like kind of learn
[SPEAKER_05]: it and have it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I kind of found Josh and Kelly
from Dragonflyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I just want to keep doing my
ganja thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want it to like be enough for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone was buying freeze dryers and I
was never into the BHO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone was doing that up here and it
just never really like interested me
[SPEAKER_05]: personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thankfully I never went down that
route, but I got a freeze dryer and got
[SPEAKER_05]: back into hash making.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I no longer had to microplane
and air dry so I could step up production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just went really, really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, washing really great resin
strains that under the full sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: In living soil that I've been building for
over six years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my yields were great.
[SPEAKER_05]: The turps were great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just super fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it really truly was like I was
able to do it all myself completely from
[SPEAKER_05]: seed to harvest to processing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it all entirely myself, packaging,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stuff my freezers myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wash it all myself, press it all myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it all because to me, I really truly
love the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every step of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I often think about hiring help.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need help.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back is broken.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I often go back to I only grow so
much and every barrel that I let someone
[SPEAKER_05]: else wash is one less barrel that I can
wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really truly just cherish the time
that I get to spend with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every moment of it teaches me so much
about myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It teaches me a lot about makes sense out
of life for me personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the world's a crazy place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's scary once you leave your house,
you leave your property, you go out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough on a person like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So being able to stay home in my ganja
sanctuary with my lady and just work with
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant and spend intimate time with the
plant, it's beyond valuable to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, it's priceless.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, this this way of life,
sadly, is kind of ending.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe this we will be the last
generation, you know, and I'm clinging to
[SPEAKER_05]: that personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm holding on to that shit for dear life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to let go.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all you're making me want to move back
to the hill really bad right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I love the passion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love the passion, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the passion and the honesty and the
truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And your voice, you know, for me,
cannabis is also a guiding light.
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost feel like it's been my shepherd,
you know, leading leading me for the last
[SPEAKER_10]: 25 to 30 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what a what a what a beautiful thing
to be a part of the last 30 almost 20,
[SPEAKER_10]: 23 years now of just sharing how to make
hash with people.
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite thing back in the day was to
travel anywhere and everywhere and show
[SPEAKER_10]: people this hash making and watch for
their eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when I lifted that seventy three
bag, the eyebrows always went up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I called it the eyebrow raise.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, here comes the seventy three
bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was during a time when no one had had
had seen this and didn't.
[SPEAKER_10]: No one understood this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was like nineteen ninety nine,
you know, where it's just it was so new
[SPEAKER_10]: and such an amazing thing to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I definitely am very happy for the
people that came before me that got me to
[SPEAKER_10]: be able to be in the place that I was at
the time that I was to sort of just be
[SPEAKER_10]: able to be, you know, one of the steps in
the ladder of this incredible hash
[SPEAKER_10]: journey.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you something, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll let you know when we did a
Legends of Hash years ago, we celebrated
[SPEAKER_10]: the legend.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we do a Legends of Hash, you have to
understand, Sam and I, when we started
[SPEAKER_10]: these parties, it wasn't to celebrate
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't see ourselves as legends.
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, Sam's a legend, but that's a
different story.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were celebrating true legends.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one year we celebrated the Garden of
Kaffur and in the Garden of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, that was the spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if I have it here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that was the figure of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what we got here is this Garden
of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just happened to have it right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did not organize that.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is literally just sitting in the left
drawer of my office.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we celebrated the Garden of Kaffur
in the 12th century Cairo.
[SPEAKER_10]: The favorite meeting place for hashish
connoisseurs was the legendary Gardens of
[SPEAKER_10]: Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_10]: Islamic law forbade the drinking of wine,
but many Muslims, especially the Sufis,
[SPEAKER_10]: were great proponents of hashish eating
and its legality was hotly debated by
[SPEAKER_10]: Islamic courts.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the 14th century, conservative Muslim
leaders won out and came down hard by
[SPEAKER_10]: destroying Kaffur's gardens, burning
surrounding hash fields and starving out
[SPEAKER_10]: the farmers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shops and cafes selling hashish were
closed and the owners hunted down and
[SPEAKER_10]: killed.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hashish use continued.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope I see a smile on your face there,
Gil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hashish use continued.
[SPEAKER_10]: In 1378, the freshman illustrated Cairo
government forced all known hashish users
[SPEAKER_10]: into the main square, where soldiers
wrenched out their teeth with pliers.
[SPEAKER_10]: A decade later, hashish eating still
thrived in Egypt as it had become too much
[SPEAKER_10]: a part of the Arab way of life to be
forsaken.
[SPEAKER_10]: May the Gardens of Kaffur serve as an
ancient reminder that cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_10]: will never succeed.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going anywhere, Gil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna manifest and change and alter
and as long as you're in your little spot,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, steering your vehicle,
it's not gonna change.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in charge of this, okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not them.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been for a long time, since before
the Gardens of Kaffur.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they're killing us and they're
wrenching out our teeth and we're still
[SPEAKER_10]: here, that says a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant creates so much passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It just like, I don't know, it just exudes
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just feel like there's
fortunately really great people
[SPEAKER_05]: surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just weird times right now where
Babylon's got its grips on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some things going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like you said, you just got to
persevere, hold on to it and you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: not much has changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, my life's only gotten better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell everyone that, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year is my best year, including this
year, you know, every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you just love Ganja.
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll love you back, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay for it to change and alter how
it looks.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we just have to make sure we
don't fall for the illusion because from
[SPEAKER_10]: my perspective, you know, I'm never gonna
fight against access and there's all this
[SPEAKER_10]: access that's now coming into play that a
lot of us aren't really overly stoked on.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I know people that are.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like we can continue with our
civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_10]: We continue to push the envelope and get
exactly what we want and how we want it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we do that by growing great cannabis,
by learning about biodynamic, organic,
[SPEAKER_10]: regenerative, sustainable growing,
by learning about these different
[SPEAKER_10]: solventless techniques for extracting the
resins and creating these wonderfully pure
[SPEAKER_10]: products.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we just keep doing that,
it'll work itself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, in California, legalization
has cut off access, though, to a large
[SPEAKER_02]: number of people, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why the civil disobedience
will be required there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's civil disobedience again is
exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how we got what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll toot my horn right now and say I kind
of gave them the finger, handed the permit
[SPEAKER_02]: back, and we're just still rocking it out
the way we have in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Civil disobedience style and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tell big companies all the time,
you know, don't harsh out on civil
[SPEAKER_10]: disobedience.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's literally what made it possible for
you to be in business right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, support those grassroots.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, don't be annoyed when you see
someone like, well, why is that guy doing
[SPEAKER_10]: it illegally if I have to get a license?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, well, that guy's an OG
frontliner who's continuing to make things
[SPEAKER_10]: better for your future licenses and seeing
as you don't want to do it because you
[SPEAKER_10]: want to protect everything you have over
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should just shut your face.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe give them a little support.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way I see it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: One good thing in California is that you
can grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow way more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bad people aren't embracing that
six plant thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I would see more people doing
their six plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, listen, growing cannabis takes a
lot of work and it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it was so easy, you'd see everyone
growing all their food, too, and making
[SPEAKER_10]: all their clothes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, listen, we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or all their beer or all their wine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's an endless amount of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: With cannabis, it's kind of we've always
gotten lost because there is this very
[SPEAKER_10]: spiritual connection to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I agreed with everything Gil
said earlier and felt very much the same
[SPEAKER_10]: way about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, you know, I have a very strong
connection to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet at the same time, you know,
I always hear people, well, Johnny B,
[SPEAKER_10]: he's a proponent of getting everyone to
grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, John, you understand that not
everyone can grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I know that I can't grow right now
because the way I'm busy and work and
[SPEAKER_10]: travel, I end up starting my garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it up to veg.
[SPEAKER_10]: I flip the lights and then I'm like,
bye sweetie.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to go on a 10 day trip.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now for 10 days, my poor wife who has
three children and runs an entire
[SPEAKER_10]: household is like watering these plants
that are taking more and more and more
[SPEAKER_10]: like every single day as they as they
fatten up and flatten flower out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't have the time to do it
personally as I, as I do what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of people who are sick and
who are unable to physically, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: take care of a garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the fact that we can grow plants in
Canada and everyone that can absolutely
[SPEAKER_10]: should.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the flip side of that, we need to have
access available to people through shops
[SPEAKER_10]: and dispensaries and online where they can
also access it from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And pretty much that's what we have right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame on you that you're not using more
automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to do this over your
fricking smartphone from wherever you are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, water your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, water your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change the light tech, whatever you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had an acre green house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was totally automated, watering
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you're a skunk man, Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just the lowly bubble man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't shame me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smart enough to do that if you want
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm even smarter because what my plan is,
is to buy a 60 foot greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_10]: put it on the rock behind my house,
get some agricultural students from the
[SPEAKER_10]: University of British Columbia or
wherever, and just bring them down to be
[SPEAKER_10]: like, look, I want half of it food.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want it all living soils and organics.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want half of it herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the cultivars that I want and kind
of let them have fun and do that while I
[SPEAKER_10]: do all of the other stuff that I'm doing
because let me tell you, I am busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like automation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's my automation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like people automation.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like people, A, it's giving them an
opportunity and B, it's giving me an
[SPEAKER_10]: opportunity as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: How fun would it be to be in a greenhouse
full of plants right now for hash church
[SPEAKER_10]: right behind my house?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a 99 plant license, federal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a federal 99 plant license that I
can grow 99 plants on my property.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can possess on my property 10 pounds of
extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm allowed to have 10 pounds of extracts
at my house, which is like, I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_10]: sometimes I need a little bit more,
so it's a bit rough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm joking, obviously.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who the fuck needs 10 pounds of extract at
their house?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's ridiculous unless you're like the
harbor side dispensary or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need 10 pounds of full mouth
bubble hash at your house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, we're going to continue on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to introduce raccombs and then
we're going to introduce the dank duchess.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, raccombs, what's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to follow Ganja Gill's
backstory, but nonetheless, my name is
[SPEAKER_07]: raccombs, Nick for short.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from the Northern California area,
Sierra mountains, originally from the Bay
[SPEAKER_07]: area, but now I reside in the Sierra
mountains or Sierra foothills alongside
[SPEAKER_07]: Chu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chu hash, but that raccombs started about
three, two and a half, three years ago and
[SPEAKER_07]: it won't go into a long beach story.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, it started, for lack of
better words, as an ode to my wife's
[SPEAKER_07]: father, who recently passed away in
Indonesia for hashish and Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was in prison there for 18 plus years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't get to see a lot of day,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, not really a grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am, my fiancee wife is a grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been growing for 10 plus years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have single source, but right now
I'm working with clients such as Ridge
[SPEAKER_07]: boys and the real Ridge boys and doing my
best to isolate as much six star as
[SPEAKER_07]: possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not the best quality that I could
possibly come by with, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: single source or an outside source and
either make that into the best rosin I can
[SPEAKER_07]: and, or the best hash that I can produce.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for confirming.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for confirming what I just said
to Ganja Gill.
[SPEAKER_10]: So 18 years, never saw the light of day,
died in prison.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys did not turn your backs on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: You embraced cannabis and as an ode to
him, started the raccombs account.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's literally exactly what I was
reading in the gardens of Kafur.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can rip out our teeth and they can
kill us, but they're not going to stop us.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, hash, hash making used to be
these big countries that were like a
[SPEAKER_10]: mighty oak tree, but now hash makers of
blades of grass everywhere, covering the
[SPEAKER_10]: earth and good luck mowing us all down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll finish off with Dank Duchess
and then we'll get into a little
[SPEAKER_10]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: She can give us a little introduction.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if she's actually frozen now,
if I get, if that was some bad timing,
[SPEAKER_10]: but are you there Duchess?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine if she got bumped.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel so bad for her.
[SPEAKER_10]: She tried for an hour to get in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So she just got bumped.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll have to come back.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are on mute.
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe try to unmute that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, she said her phone died.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what, when she gets in
here, we'll let her introduce herself.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the meantime, I wanted to start
talking about, you know, one of the good
[SPEAKER_10]: things of, of as a hash maker,
if you're looking to really, for that
[SPEAKER_10]: cleanliness is godliness.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're looking for that chef SOP,
when you get your material, get to know
[SPEAKER_10]: it, dump it out, look at it, filter
through it, you know, see what you've got
[SPEAKER_10]: that you're working through rather than
just through the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's coming from an outdoor grow,
it's never a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even some of the greenhouses, um,
to prewash your material, just really,
[SPEAKER_10]: I do it in not a very, very cold water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do it in a sort of room temperature
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll put materials in, I'll have my rubber
gloves on and I'll gently just sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: massage the material, releasing large
little, little dusty stones and little
[SPEAKER_10]: mini pebbles.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd be amazed at what can get stuck on
the plant from an outdoor grow,
[SPEAKER_10]: giving it that little prewash,
filtering out those, that heavy sediment
[SPEAKER_10]: that will just contaminate your hash and
look like little black dots in your hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you, if you get the microscope out
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: So are, are, are you guys doing that on
the regular, when you see material come in
[SPEAKER_10]: that seems dirty and dusty?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys pre-wash?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really, uh, prewash fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried, but, uh, when I was up at the
Menda Whiteout, we were doing 10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done, experimented with the prewash
right at harvest, prewash, let it hang,
[SPEAKER_02]: drip dry, and then into the freezers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really say, I can't really say I
did enough experimenting with it to say we
[SPEAKER_02]: got much cleaner or lost any yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash was still good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: We prewash all our material, uh,
as when we're harvesting it and then,
[SPEAKER_12]: and then shake it off and drip dry it and
in the drying room.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then air dry it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say that if it's fresh
material, you're going to have a really
[SPEAKER_13]: hard time knowing the quality of that
material after it's frozen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so be there prepping,
you know, try to, try to be able to prep
[SPEAKER_13]: that material for the gardener or,
you know, work out something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause that's not, want to know what's in
the freezer before it's all frozen
[SPEAKER_13]: together.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely love the idea of,
and we do it every time, of like very
[SPEAKER_12]: carefully observing all the material.
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually this year we've been breaking
the material right down into the,
[SPEAKER_12]: into the, into the bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, like you said, pretty much
looking at every flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: piece of flower that goes in there before
it goes in the bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to look at the material with a
jeweler's loop first.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm, if I'm like actually going to wash
other people's material, be on site,
[SPEAKER_08]: see it, look at with like a 30 X or 15 X,
see what's really there.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the size, the shape, how many,
how dense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the day in Vancouver, it was so
bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, living in the Pacific Northwest
and people thinking they can grow Afghanis
[SPEAKER_10]: up here and they just, they attract
powdery mildew like, like you can't
[SPEAKER_10]: possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you live in the Pacific Northwest
and then you know exactly how they attract
[SPEAKER_10]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: But back in the day, I first started
making bubble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone gave me the most beautiful
material and I ran it through my bags and
[SPEAKER_10]: the hash was just like white and it was
like full.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's six star and I took a small dab
of it and it was just sulfur, like heads
[SPEAKER_10]: of matches.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's when I learned about Defender
and all of these sulfur burner products
[SPEAKER_10]: and how badly they contaminate glandular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then of course people would say things
to me like, oh, well, we only do that in,
[SPEAKER_10]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't happen in flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm like, yeah, but you
understand like glandular trichomes are
[SPEAKER_10]: present on the plant from the time the
first two true leaves come out of the
[SPEAKER_10]: seedling, which is the called the
epicoddle comes in after the caudalodon,
[SPEAKER_10]: which are those two round leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first two true leaves, the epicoddle,
if you photograph the leaves, they're
[SPEAKER_10]: covered in bulbous, bulbous trichomes from
like one day, two days old type of thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you hear someone say, I only spray
in veg.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just flush the toilet on that
right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to take it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say what I would do is
I'd grab the material a little bit,
[SPEAKER_10]: a pinch out of the bag and I would light
it with a lighter and then I would hold it
[SPEAKER_10]: under my nose with my eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if it had the lightest amount of
sulfur on that material, that's how I
[SPEAKER_10]: would discover it right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that kept me from ruining a set of
bubble bags because I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_10]: sulfur is like the worst.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't get it out of the oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't get it out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll never forget almost over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to go standing on my deck,
which is two doors down from the property
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on now, and hocking 29 grams of
that white, full melt hash, like right
[SPEAKER_10]: into the bush.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I just couldn't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could have eaten it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could, I was like, listen,
that hash was an abomination and it needed
[SPEAKER_10]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes through in the edible too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, uh, that the hash was all sulfury
and we were like, shit, maybe we can make
[SPEAKER_02]: some cake pops or something with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what you can make?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a disc to throw.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you can make.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, yeah, I mean, I've seen like
a couple of kilos thrown away from people
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying sulfur too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely, yeah, can murder you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur weed is actually devil weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't handle it at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's the, it's,
it was the worst thing back in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, it was a big thing that people
saw a lot and bubble bags really affected
[SPEAKER_10]: that whole use of those.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rack them, go rack them, rack them with
some sieve tech.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to mute you while you do
that because that's loud as fuck in my
[SPEAKER_10]: ears.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, don't, no, don't worry about a dude at
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, I love the fact that you're
processing hash and getting ready to make
[SPEAKER_10]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, yeah, smash extract sulfur is such
trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen so much hash ruined.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just unfortunate, but it did affect
the grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's the worst because back
in the day I was able to go to the BC
[SPEAKER_10]: Compassion Club and explain to them,
you know, this, this, and this actually
[SPEAKER_10]: has sulfur on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's by teaching them that small
trick, grabbing a little bud, lighting it
[SPEAKER_10]: on fire, holding it under your nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even the people who was, were doing
quality control for the BC Compassion Club
[SPEAKER_10]: back in the day had no idea and were
unwittingly buying this material that had
[SPEAKER_10]: sulfur on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it goes back to the, you know,
it goes back to show you that people are
[SPEAKER_10]: people and you don't have to be a big
company to be a douche bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very like small micro grow,
like, let's just grow a batch and make
[SPEAKER_10]: some hash can also be shitty.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've seen it even in amazing places
like Jamaica, where the growers are,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, these conscious Rastafarian
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes between you not being able
to feed your family or have any money for
[SPEAKER_10]: the next three months versus, I'm just
going to pour some poisonous fungicides
[SPEAKER_10]: that are illegal in other countries on
this material.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can at least crop out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wouldn't believe how many people
choose the latter.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't have to be a big evil
corporation to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, very small farmers, small hash
makers have been known to do it as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for me, I say we get rid of the trust
in our industry and we move into full
[SPEAKER_10]: testing for everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would love to see it also affect,
a lot of people want cannabis to be less
[SPEAKER_10]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do in aspects of it, but the regulations
of spraying chemicals and poisons and
[SPEAKER_10]: deadly toxins on the plant, I love those
regulations being high.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love things being in place where that
can be found and those people who
[SPEAKER_10]: perpetrate that can be caught.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also love the idea of that system
having an influence on our food,
[SPEAKER_10]: water and air systems that are currently
completely have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: exposed to a vast varieties of toxins and
poisons and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't be a bad thing if our food
kind of picked up a little bit from the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis industry and maybe tested things
a little more.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe when something's organic and
naturally grown, we just call that food.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when something's been grown with
deadly chemicals, you know, instead of the
[SPEAKER_10]: word organic, let's make them have a
fucking word like Chemex food or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is Chemex.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want some Chemex tomatoes,
by all means, they're three cents a pound.
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy as many as you like.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's my opinion anyway.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's maybe that's a good time to break
into some of the strain stuff or in terms
[SPEAKER_14]: of specific strains into like living in
Maine, coming back out of 11 years in
[SPEAKER_14]: Southern, from Trinity to Southern
Humboldt all around in the Emerald.
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely brought my breeding with me
out there and then back home to Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I noticed is in many places in
Northern California, you can grow just
[SPEAKER_14]: about anything other than the polar
opposites of maybe a hard indica,
[SPEAKER_14]: hard sativa.
[SPEAKER_14]: Back into Maine, I really enjoy sun
growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm growing in, you know, greenhouse,
automated light dep, indoors as well,
[SPEAKER_14]: all living soil organic.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know that Maine has a really high
humidity problem and each season is
[SPEAKER_14]: different.
[SPEAKER_14]: You get beautiful sun depending on
location and the water's pristine,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is another thing coming from a
beautiful water place to move back for
[SPEAKER_14]: the, you know, the plentiful water was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then I'm battling with high humidity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Certain grow seasons being better than
others and definitely have a lock on some
[SPEAKER_14]: strains that have done well outside that
are specific to the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: How early are you guys having to finish
out there in Maine?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man, I have on my Instagram,
I actually have a pineapple fields from
[SPEAKER_14]: dynasty genetics that rode till October
30th, right on pre Halloween cut this
[SPEAKER_14]: year.
[SPEAKER_14]: So depending, I mean, we had a later
season this last one, but the one before
[SPEAKER_14]: was an early cut.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it was like really kind of harsh
into October.
[SPEAKER_14]: After October 1st, it was pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_14]: You needed to be in a house.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was not, the outside potential is kind
of gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to have early strains.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got, I mean, sour banana sherbert,
I got a pheno that just pranks off super
[SPEAKER_14]: early, like third week September outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not my favorite strain, but it's
beautiful, beautiful work in terms of
[SPEAKER_14]: loud, bright, comes off well.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a few types locked in on,
but it's really taken a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_14]: cycle through plants that don't do well,
don't finish well, that are susceptible
[SPEAKER_14]: early to the mildew.
[SPEAKER_14]: They test bad for botrytis.
[SPEAKER_14]: So working through a lot of populations of
plants with just very few keepers,
[SPEAKER_14]: like under half three, three, four types
for the outside in the main that I keep
[SPEAKER_14]: on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then obviously indoor, I got a whole
bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only imagine being from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never successfully pulled off a harvest
outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I had a guy working for me first year
back in helping me that was from
[SPEAKER_14]: Wisconsin, actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was amazed with the how well it
went into Maine, actually, but you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: it is site dependent.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's micro climates per site.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in the foothills at like 625 feet.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not too low, not too high up and in
a beautiful area, just full sun all day,
[SPEAKER_14]: beautiful water.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's site dependent in Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not everywhere it grows, great
cannabis, but I have a list, I guess,
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe just share real quick and then shut
up about my list of strains that make the
[SPEAKER_14]: best hash if you want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we definitely want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go through our list, starting with
best friend farms.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first off, I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love my own strands, but there's a East
Coast sour diesel to that original cut
[SPEAKER_14]: headband that we call diesel bam.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just, it's popping off grease.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, you can't even touch it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The stuff melts.
[SPEAKER_14]: The rhyme turns to just terpene resin
sauce by the end of even like a couple
[SPEAKER_14]: months.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a ball that's like five,
six months old and it's just completely
[SPEAKER_14]: blob like moose poop in a jar,
you know, and it's like, is there a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular method that that variety is
best for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is it dry sit, water hash,
rosin?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're just, that was from cured
resin, cured flower from sun grown on this
[SPEAKER_14]: run of that particular ball.
[SPEAKER_14]: And no matter indoor or out, it just seems
to throw a terpene profile percentage and
[SPEAKER_14]: a reaction of terpene to the resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like some strains do they just like for a
classic hash temple ball style,
[SPEAKER_14]: it breaks the rind right down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just turns to blob, whereas other
strains will trap the, what I would call
[SPEAKER_14]: like the cream.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how you'd phrase it,
but the creepy innards within the rind and
[SPEAKER_14]: really form a sealed rind.
[SPEAKER_14]: The diesel band just completely breaks it
down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I remember from back early days of the
real East East coast, our diesel cut that
[SPEAKER_14]: that was doing the same thing too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's coming from that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's the same thing with sour diesels
that'll butter a lot easier as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that's sour diesel right there
behind me, there's some fresh rosin,
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah, it's definitely, I feel like
that, like those OG kind of terpenes will
[SPEAKER_08]: butter a lot easier, quicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody else have that same kind of.
[SPEAKER_14]: I noticed it all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I run another one that's I call gas mask.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a headband by kosher Kush Mac and
saw Mac one.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a Mac tie Mac male tie in,
but it was a great cut of kosher.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and then of course the original
headband.
[SPEAKER_14]: Headband cut and that one's just,
just amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of the strains I'm liking to run for
my quality, my style of hash classic hash
[SPEAKER_14]: temple balling or pressing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm finding to be what would be called
maybe gasier strains.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, these days I got a kosher Mac.
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: A kosher Mac tray along with that kosher
Mac headband that are my top three with
[SPEAKER_14]: the diesel band, but underneath diesel
band.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then to end it, I go 24 karat gold.
[SPEAKER_14]: From DNA does amazing work.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of my favorites to smoke that
kosher tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say enough favorite over here.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 K is my all time favorite over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a fiend of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dumps and gas fruit.
[SPEAKER_14]: It dumps down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange is pretty played out, but when
people get their hands on this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're back into the orange.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got our second funeral with that one
running right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: It takes the Kush phenoline and the
growth.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the flowers just, people kind of hear
it and go, Oh, tangy played out a little
[SPEAKER_14]: bit or kosher.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It stays right in my jar on the table with
the headband, diesel band type thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a Traystar from Top Dog Seeds
actually turns out some like really fiery,
[SPEAKER_14]: really fiery Afghan one to their Traystar
dog or star dog work.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just getting some old like greasy
type looking quality hash that,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, to throw it back.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Moroccan super keef and Nepalese
temple ball, honestly, is being my
[SPEAKER_14]: favorites to throw back to.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where I'm kind of looking for
those resins that will form for me like
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to ask, can you force flower
plants out with the sun in Maine?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or light depth?
[SPEAKER_14]: Light depth is my spine.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my backbone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trained from six or seven,
honestly, in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone threw me in the mix.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, there you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I kind of went, whoa.
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly turned out, yeah,
like, you know, a really big turn of
[SPEAKER_14]: really, really good force flowering.
[SPEAKER_14]: I stick to the light depth all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess my another question would be,
you're using lights in that, in there too,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not supplementing myself.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So no lights in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a black card trick.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just manipulate light structure,
which I think for like Maine or even into
[SPEAKER_14]: Canada, it's kind of can be crucial,
you know, in terms of getting the
[SPEAKER_14]: potential out of your row season and to
grow types that wouldn't normally grow
[SPEAKER_14]: outside sun growing from my turps in the
Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can pull almost anything, you know,
in the depth.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: We ran Weasel Skunk from Nature Farm this
year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Original Diesel and Skunk 18.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so far I'm absolutely loving it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's really, really greasy,
but it's not like too hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, it's like, yeah, it's just,
it's not skunk grease.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks greasy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just like, it's just,
and I agree like a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also like the, the, the, the piney
strains I noticed will be like really
[SPEAKER_12]: greasy too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year we ran, what was it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Scapegoat?
[SPEAKER_12]: Scapegoat genetics, Dale Denton.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a Nom Nom with Pineapple
Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of our favorites last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was that, it was that total grease
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That like apple, apple jelly type.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good relationship between the terpene
profile and the resins.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interesting to see how they react
over time and curing.
[SPEAKER_12]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause like, cause the GMO, like one we
really love for hashing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is really like more savory turps and
it's definitely more stable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it does, you give it some heat,
it'll definitely grease up a bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, but it, it, it not as much as,
not as much as others.
[SPEAKER_12]: It, it, it's more, it's more stable and
it'll stay stable and warmer temperatures
[SPEAKER_12]: more than, than other strains.
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that super skunk seems to really
pull through that diesel band.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that mass super skunk, I believe
that's in that lineage.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's that, that, that extreme good,
just skunky diesel taste, but also the
[SPEAKER_14]: terpene resin probe, you know,
relationship there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good that everyone's sharing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could share probably a hundred,
but I'm not going to cause that's
[SPEAKER_10]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably one of my all time favorites from
back in the day would be the Renee.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was really the cultivar that
started the, you know, bubble bags as a
[SPEAKER_10]: company, because it was the first cultivar
that I gained access to in large amounts
[SPEAKER_10]: that I was able to consistently make hash
out of that would, you know, come out
[SPEAKER_10]: white.
[SPEAKER_10]: And eventually when I would let it air dry
and whatnot, it would, it would turn like
[SPEAKER_10]: stained glass window, like in a church,
you know, it would be these different like
[SPEAKER_10]: reds and oranges and ambers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could just like see through it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a little foggy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was, that was, that was full,
full mouth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was that, that was six stars.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the first cultivar hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things I loved about it,
I mean, one of the things I didn't love
[SPEAKER_10]: about it was the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure I got this wrong back in the
day, what we really said, and we based
[SPEAKER_10]: this on the fact that the water didn't
retain the smell when you ran Renee
[SPEAKER_10]: instead, the smell was retained in the
resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had assumed that somehow,
you know, they were water soluble,
[SPEAKER_10]: the ones in the majority of cultivars and
that the alcohol soluble terpenes perhaps
[SPEAKER_10]: were not, and did not wash out for,
for whatever reason, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_10]: that's correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure if Dr. Mark was here,
he'd be like, actually this is what's
[SPEAKER_10]: happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the bottom line is, is that,
yeah, those, those resins, those terpenes
[SPEAKER_10]: when you washed Renee were so,
so strong in the hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: It still smelt like a half pound of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, the cultivar was nicknamed,
this is a terrible nickname, pot to get
[SPEAKER_10]: you busted.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pot to get you busted.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got so many friends kicked out of hotel
rooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend got arrested on a bicycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: He had a half pound of it in his backpack,
riding his bike in downtown Vancouver and
[SPEAKER_10]: some bike cops went by him and caught the
whiff.
[SPEAKER_10]: The shit was dank.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, if you remember Hybe down in
the Pacific Northwest, he did a strain
[SPEAKER_10]: years ago called the dab, the dank ass
bitch.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it had like the emerald triangle funk
and some other cultivar in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, there was, that was reminiscent of
the Renee.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Renee had the funk and the funk was
like, you couldn't escape it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The smallest amount of it would reek up
your house in a seriously heat score
[SPEAKER_10]: manner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I had a butt of it in my pocket one
time, like 10 hours had gone by.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went Christmas shopping, did all this
stuff, went through a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cop was like, pull over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: The expert comes over, the RCMP who says,
I am an expert in marijuana growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been in over a hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what he said to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can tell you've just been in a,
in a marijuana grow up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, listen, man, I'm going to be
super honest with you because a I'm sure
[SPEAKER_10]: on your computer, it shows that at a
roadblock, just like this, not too long
[SPEAKER_10]: ago, I got busted with 16 and a half
pounds, uh, pounds of urban and about six
[SPEAKER_10]: grand cash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew he had seen that and I,
I was so confident and I had presence
[SPEAKER_10]: wrapped in the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was so confident.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I promise you, I am not an idiot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, there is no cannabis in my car
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you smell my pocket, I had a small
bud in there about 10 hours ago and he
[SPEAKER_10]: leaned in and smelled my pocket and
completely believed me and let,
[SPEAKER_10]: and let me drive away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my all time favorite hash making
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a cultivar where the smell
does not stay in the water, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the more of that, of those terpenes that
can transfer aspire into the hash,
[SPEAKER_10]: those are the cultivars that you want for
producing full mouth because I'm quite
[SPEAKER_10]: certain it's the terpene profile that is
most responsible for the melt aspect of
[SPEAKER_09]: the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we talk about water for a second
without going off all day on water?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I know we could, we could do that,
but do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to see if everybody really
uses RO and I also wanted to say it's not
[SPEAKER_13]: necessarily, I mean, for me, at least
that's a lot of water, like RO making,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a lot of wasted water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hella wasteful.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and, and you know, like if you,
if you have clean water, you got to set
[SPEAKER_13]: like a bunch of sad filters maybe,
or carbon filter on, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: like get some things going on where it
depends on where you are too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to go off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Gil can probably distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: A sediment filter right off the spring up
on the hill is some of the best water you
[SPEAKER_02]: can use for making that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sediment and dechlorinator.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I really use.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm in Portland, so I'm fortunate
to have fantastic water here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just through that, it comes out at zero
PPM.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, we get to go gallons per minute.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're doing 20 gallons per minute,
22 gallons a minute, refresh all in Maine
[SPEAKER_14]: on my well.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a three 50 foot as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Water just pristine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm running through some testing and just
like carbon filtration right now,
[SPEAKER_14]: but looking into even advanced filtration
for the sediment and such.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, it's not Babylon water
supply.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not bleached in chloramide and
chloramine and whatever else that you got
[SPEAKER_14]: to strip out, which I would do if I'm in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, down here in Sebastopol.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of, we have to run an RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water is horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was living up in Northern Mendo
up on the hill, man, we literally down a
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic tube from the spring box through
the ship, like 39 degrees coming off the
[SPEAKER_02]: hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we barely had to use any ice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing beats that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had that for six years when I lived on
the water, we pulled our water out of the
[SPEAKER_10]: creek that went right into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just, you know, a nice little
filtration system going down to like point
[SPEAKER_10]: zero five micron or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had we didn't have to dechlorinate
or anything because it was just literally
[SPEAKER_10]: coming right off right off the mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've made a hash with water all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously when you can control and
condition and, you know, control all the
[SPEAKER_10]: parameters of your water, perhaps,
you know, I think as hash makers that more
[SPEAKER_10]: people would do it and play around with it
if they had access to really play around
[SPEAKER_10]: with the pH of their water and see how the
resin reacts differently on the alkaline
[SPEAKER_10]: side versus the acidic side of your water.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, having an RO unit is great and
having filters, depending on where you're
[SPEAKER_10]: pulling your water from.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, it's easy to find out what you
need for your water filtration system.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go get your water tested.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you find out what's in it,
you can then find out the methods of
[SPEAKER_10]: removing each of those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then those are the things that you
require to clean your water and get it
[SPEAKER_10]: ready for nice water extraction.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember you making a big old ball of
some real really dank hash on a video from
[SPEAKER_14]: way back with you, Marcus, that was
actually in Jamaica in the back,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, in the bush of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember like big old barrels and then
just coming out with this like grapefruit
[SPEAKER_14]: size swirly galax.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that's motivation for me with those
swirly balls that we're pulling and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just seeing it done out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to hear motivation?
[SPEAKER_10]: We walked for an hour and a half with,
I'm telling you, like it had to be maybe a
[SPEAKER_10]: hundred pounds of ice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wondered if you had a generator like.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was in the bush.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had nothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We walked for an hour and a half and
everyone took their turn carrying this
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking thing of ice on their head.
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't matter who you were.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gypsy Nirvana definitely did it probably
for the shortest amount of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wally, the Australian Wally Duck,
if you remember that guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: What an amazing character he was.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nothing for him to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was kind of a little guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nothing for him to work in like
plus 35 degrees or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's 100 degrees in Jamaica in the
shade.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're carrying this ice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we got there, I was like,
oh, so what should I mix with?
[SPEAKER_10]: And he just gave me like a fence post that
he had like carved kind of like a handle
[SPEAKER_10]: into.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I straight like was doing this like
with 20 gallon batches.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a mountain of herb in that place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the look on his face and how happy he
was when I took his, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: subcar sort of mid grade Jamaican weed and
turned it into a decent for him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I went home.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went home and actually made my own,
which was what that big ball that you saw
[SPEAKER_10]: was.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't make that at the place that
looked like I went and doubled up and went
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was like, OK, now I got to go home
and make good hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for setting up that meeting,
Gypsy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice Gypsy.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good friend with him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times with Gypsy all over the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had some adventures.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a good thing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: It really pulls you in these different
directions.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can pull you, especially the hash,
you know, like there's hash producing
[SPEAKER_10]: countries that every hash maker probably
at one point in time may want to go check
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like the idea of ice and ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be my best topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we've got I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we talk about the ice, I like the
idea of and we're not doing this really on
[SPEAKER_12]: the on a full scale yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we'd like to like actually like when
you're done with a wash, saving that water
[SPEAKER_12]: in a reservoir and fermenting it and using
that to feed back into the garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because at least we do it at a seasonal,
you know, seasonal scale.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we make hash in the winter.
[SPEAKER_12]: We grow plants in the summer type deal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put anything, anything you possibly can
that came out of the garden back into the
[SPEAKER_13]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: Feed the feed your soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And make sure your soil is clean because
hemp cannabis, it's a phytoremediative
[SPEAKER_10]: plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will literally pull toxic heavy metals,
et cetera, out of your soil if they're
[SPEAKER_10]: present.
[SPEAKER_10]: So test your water, test your soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are great ways to open the door to,
well, how am I going to know?
[SPEAKER_10]: How am I going to know what kind of
filters I need?
[SPEAKER_10]: How am I going to know?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, well, you'll know by testing
your soil and testing your water.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty good spot to start if you want to
start down the road as of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: grower, which is definitely the best way
if you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you really have to have full
access.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when someone else is growing your
inputs, because, you know, they'll show
[SPEAKER_10]: you everything sometimes except maybe
something that they shouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_10]: spraying or feeding the plant at one point
in time in its life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it's a tough one because it's
also connected to a way of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, oh, like you've built a family and
you're taking care of this whole group of
[SPEAKER_10]: people and you have these dependents and
now your crop is about to die and you're
[SPEAKER_10]: in this position where it's like,
holy shit, like we just need to squeeze
[SPEAKER_10]: another couple of weeks out of this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it, but it sucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's especially sucks for people who
are the ones that end up on the wrong end
[SPEAKER_10]: of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish there was a better way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish that cannabis farmers could be
insured.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like how great would that be?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like not for stupidity, but like,
you know, legitimate like you did
[SPEAKER_10]: everything right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And something still kind of found its way
and got in.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be nice if you could.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably dreaming in a utopian world here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, 25 years ago, I thought a utopian
world would be being able to go to a store
[SPEAKER_10]: and buy legal hash and herb, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got almost 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I have to figure out is are we just
going to continue on with this panel and
[SPEAKER_10]: finish off the day and do the rosin panel
next week?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or are we going to end this panel and
invite the rosin panel in at 11 o'clock?
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys feel?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys have a couple more?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we could probably keep talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could probably talk again.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're the one that has to sit in here
for another.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'd like to be able to talk more
about hash making for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure the rosin folks would
understand if we pushed the rosin episode
[SPEAKER_10]: till next Sunday, because we haven't
talked about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, even all of us haven't given our
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got one, two, three, four,
five, six, about seven, eight cultivars
[SPEAKER_10]: that three or four of us have mentioned.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's still quite a few people in
the room who haven't mentioned their
[SPEAKER_10]: favorite cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that'll be a part people like go
back to and rewind and try to write those
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivars down, because that's you know,
we're basically giving you a full mount
[SPEAKER_10]: certification of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: And along with that, we will also let you
know how the cannabis was grown,
[SPEAKER_10]: if we know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might be helpful, because you
know, maybe you're doing a hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is only going to really do this
this particular way in dirt, or,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, vice versa or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, if anyone else wants to share
some cultivars, I'm sure everyone
[SPEAKER_10]: listening and we have, by the way,
864 people listening, which is the most
[SPEAKER_10]: we've had in a live audience in 2020.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: When Hash Church was at its peak,
we would have about 1000 people a week
[SPEAKER_10]: watching live.
[SPEAKER_10]: So great job panel for bringing in almost
900 people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the cultivars I really enjoyed
working with this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Flynn and Resonance work with it a
lot as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it grows very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had success with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor, outdoor and in a depth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did you know, it pretty much does to
work for you in the bags as far as the 93
[SPEAKER_04]: 120 goes and you know, it rosins great as
well dries very nicely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very stable and easy resin to work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it presses very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a I know it's all around,
you know, checks all boxes for me looks
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal, yield, presentation all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even am venturing out into running
some CNC crosses and other stuff mixed
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's definitely one that I'm going
to keep around and keep working with,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially all the different all the
different phenos.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ran the five and the seven and the 13
this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all a little different in
their own way, but they all make super
[SPEAKER_04]: great hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I enjoyed working with each one of
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got some concentrated X cookies and
cream right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: Air hash strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's rosin strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen around even four or five years
ago with have hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was dumping just the just milky rosin
even from just cured, cured flower dump to
[SPEAKER_14]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that and the Kimbo Kush,
the Kimbo Kush, you know, similar genetic
[SPEAKER_08]: line was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the first time I watched it and
was like, oh, that's why Cuban won all
[SPEAKER_08]: those cups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the shit dumps and it just is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was from dry material.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could only imagine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I got fresh for frozen,
but another one I like to do is my
[SPEAKER_08]: personal favorite is OG pie breath.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I've been running.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a solid phenote checks all boxes as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been trying to search through seeds
to see something new.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just can't find anything that really
has beaten it for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just keep running it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We ran we watched some peanut butter
breath from a local grower last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it washed really, really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been wanting to try growing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just thought I'd mention it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep them coming, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll throw one down.
[SPEAKER_10]: DNA genetic strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the best out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I run their white walker too, even as like
a classic hash strain for a really good
[SPEAKER_14]: indica temple ball cured resin temple ball
strain makes a shiny coating on the
[SPEAKER_14]: outside of the white walker balls and just
nice after time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice three on the inside, but it's one of
our indica choices, more indica choices.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you scroll through my feed on IG,
you're going to see a lot of banana OG.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's very similar to that strong.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I haven't ran the straw Nana,
but from what I've heard from soil grown
[SPEAKER_13]: and other folks that have run it very
similar, you know, white in every bag,
[SPEAKER_13]: very heavy yielding, maybe a high wax
content why it's so crockets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And say to me there's different cuts,
floating around.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like that straw Nana, the 14 or is
what I hear people refer to it as,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to me that's really big yields
and it's great unto itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also this other cut going
around called strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, you know, to me they're two
different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: The strawberry banana is more closely
related to the banana OG that I see around
[SPEAKER_05]: the straw Nana is more speared out kind of
different structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, that strawberry banana,
I personally prefer over the, the straw
[SPEAKER_05]: Nana 14 or, um, I get like 6.3,
5% melt back on fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dumps super terpy and washing it for
years, but everyone still loves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like a strawberry milkshake,
you know, like people can't get enough of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That banana that you watched Gil is
something really fired too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, you know, that you have a super
special, I got to try some of the last
[SPEAKER_04]: time we hung out and I really enjoyed that
was one of my favorite bananas that I
[SPEAKER_04]: tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a super awesome banana OG cut
that's been up here in the humbled area
[SPEAKER_05]: for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like again, I think there's probably a few
banana OGs out there, but that one that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're talking about, it does stand out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just super candy banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: The strawberry fields that comes in pretty
hot too with the Crockett right behind
[SPEAKER_14]: with DNA project there on this,
on the Tangy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Throwing in on the strawberry banana had
some really good phenos of strawberry
[SPEAKER_14]: fields five, four or five years ago out
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've carried into my genetic
program.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually today I do a Clementine cookies
and cream actually to my angel food cake.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, it's just really, really gives
that, you know, fruit forward,
[SPEAKER_14]: cookie back type thing for breeding too,
with those, those fruity turps on a,
[SPEAKER_14]: on a gemmy cookie on the back end for the
look, you know, and then the bread just
[SPEAKER_14]: allowed on the strawberry banana and throw
Tangy and it's hard to go around that
[SPEAKER_14]: Midas touch of Tangy type thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll throw another one out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice producer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Resin leaves very little residual and
grown properly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got that heavy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we didn't wait last year and it did
really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: To me vanilla, vanilla cake flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually grow outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so greasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a bitch to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes awesome melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I lose a lot to the bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so f*****g sticky personally where,
uh, it's not saying I don't love it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just as far as working with it,
that GMO that strawberry banana,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just drier resins that are easier
to handle for me personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my experience with wedding cake,
but it's an awesome full melt strain.
[SPEAKER_12]: 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great strains, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a nice long list so far.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to, I'll do an Instagram post
and post it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That motor breath 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting high five percentage yields on
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice dry resin to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone in California hash brands are
running with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That motor breath is fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Key lime pie is an oldie, but a goodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been washing that for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes great, great resins.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like upper 4%.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the grease monkey?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got that in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got some crosses from exotic
genetics where it's all the grease monkeys
[SPEAKER_05]: is the male.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great one too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody ran the original or washed the
original grease monkey?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got that phenome in so I haven't
grown it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like the grease monkey a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever we ran it, it seemed to grow
fairly well, fairly vigorous.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people hate on glue, but I love
glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can find a good glue hitter,
especially back to the cookies and cream,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard to beat that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a Buda Tahoe I crossed for that
mac mail.
[SPEAKER_14]: My friend sent me some of that mac pollen
actually and I hit the Buda Tahoe and it's
[SPEAKER_14]: turning out some just amazing resins in
terms of how they bond and after pressing
[SPEAKER_14]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just looking wise and then very classic
cushy hash smell.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not super out front loud.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think some of it might wash back into
the water or something as I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_14]: So and finding so.
[SPEAKER_14]: But amazing resins off the Buda Tahoe for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just got another cultivar in tooth called
Twizzlers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a kosher tangy 24K I guess cross with
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also a new one to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have I haven't washed or and or pressed
those strains independently, but I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: wondering if any of you guys on the panel
had any experience with those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Twizzlers kosher kosher tangy cross with
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The new one from the Bay, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think both of those I know I've
seen cherry pie do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously I've seen kosher tangy do
amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potential is there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need some Twizzlers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new strain in the Bay supposedly
just starting to pop up in sessions and
[SPEAKER_07]: around the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be so loud.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a couple times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even sure who the breeder is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love in the list, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love in the list.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to get this list.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Use high CBD strains and you either make
rosin or whatever you make out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have a different texture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I made my CBD strain,
I found it was very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very sticky.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got super glue out of my hemp field this
year.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did one acre and I actually turned some
sour space candy into some bubble balls.
[SPEAKER_14]: The bubble hash temple balls.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm pressing in ball and some hemp
strains just for trying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a purple orange from Dynafem.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like a one to one, two to one thing
that I'm running that makes amazing ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering about varieties that have
little to no THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sour space candy was straight CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost not even registerable THC at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that made like gluey, tacky,
black type of hash, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we were even impressed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not melt.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we didn't get a melt off of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the tack on it was like you couldn't
pull the thing apart.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to cut it, heat it up or
something to get it to even pull apart.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really gluey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Had a lot of glue to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: From the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cured resin flower.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I missed you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You cut out Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dry sift was dry for me on the hemp stuff
on the CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly what I found.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: Unheaded glands that were sticky and very
little smell.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's that cherry smell too that
people say is the cherry smell from the
[SPEAKER_13]: CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD doesn't have a smell.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the terpene profile, Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've watched a whole 10 foot plant of one
of those and it was just not a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_13]: All that good stuff just washes right down
the drain.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually just read a Tangy stud or what
was it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Taffy stud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tangy to LA affy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a guava jelly male also on
multiple types from Oregon CBD in my hemp
[SPEAKER_14]: field this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got some terp forward match ups
coming up for real medicine strengths.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was hoping to pull some beautiful hash
with a flavor from it,
actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: So many good cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got any left in the room?
[SPEAKER_17]: Grape pie.
[SPEAKER_17]: I always do good with grape pie.
[SPEAKER_15]: GMOs, all the GMO.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a GMO by cooking using cream that
does real well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonka bars, it's called.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonka bars, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to try that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So many good cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do kind of dream of a day where
cultivars are like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: that they're excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: That they're accessible, that you can just
order them in an aseptic box from a tissue
[SPEAKER_10]: culture company and they've been initiated
and all of the, anything's been like
[SPEAKER_10]: guaranteed to not be present from a virus
microbial fungi perspective and just have
[SPEAKER_10]: the advantage of being able to choose all
of these different cultivars and not only
[SPEAKER_10]: choose them blindly, but choose them based
on data collected from extractors who are
[SPEAKER_10]: processing in a variety of ways with all
of these different cultivars and showing
[SPEAKER_10]: where these cultivars shine the most in
their extraction processes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then you could order your cultivars
like, oh, I want to do a dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I just want to dry sift the
whole crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you like open the tissue culture menu
and see like, oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first two pages is our dry sift
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, these are the dry sift cultivars
for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the indoor dry sift cultivars,
you know, and have each extraction process
[SPEAKER_10]: down the line have that available.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would just be, a really
beautiful, beautiful thing if that were
[SPEAKER_10]: the case, you know, clean initiated,
vigorous genetics ready to express.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what about those hash strains that have
large heads?
[SPEAKER_08]: You were talking about that earlier and
I've, my strain, the OG pie breath has
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty melty heads in the 150 and 180.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I found that with lights that have
higher UV intensity, that's actually
[SPEAKER_08]: created more of a melt in the higher,
higher micron range.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anybody else seen that like with CMH
or what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_08]: The plasma or LED?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really say I have firsthand,
but man, Jibs, I don't know, probably
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody in here files trichome heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been pulling huge 220, 180,
150 bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said he, he can't, I've been
talking to him about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't really put his finger on why he's
getting big heads from growers that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with in the past and he didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he said he's getting some on
salt grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's getting it on living soil grows that
he's getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just, just thinks that it's just
genetics have gotten better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it fresh frozen or dried material?
[SPEAKER_02]: He works with all fresh frozen too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh frozen will be bigger heads than
dried material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially driving cured material.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really big though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying it's only because of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that fresh frozen material
has bigger heads than dried and cured
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely undeniable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it starts to raise it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Has anybody messed with washing partially
dry?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dried material.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Chris, Bobby didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you guys did it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your last job, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran a lot of stuff that was just like
harvested, hung for a couple of days and
[SPEAKER_03]: then bucked down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it would be fresh frozen into
freezers and then washed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the freeze jar, like drying the
hash or drying the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're hang drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was anywhere from like five to seven
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a really cold dark room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the material was handled by,
you know, one to two people and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: bucked down real lightly into the freezer
and then washed that way by hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and that was just for
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't making, there was no,
like we're making six star here and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, they were producing rosin
there and you know, that was that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you prefer now?
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that you guys do fresh frozen,
what do you guys prefer or what do you
[SPEAKER_08]: prefer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh frozen a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the, you know, the full melt that
comes from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, I've made a lot of full melt from dry
material and it's good, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the difference between the terpenes and
the effects is totally different for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you've got really good material
that dumps for fresh frozen, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's such a fun thing to wash that
material versus doing it dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really like to smoke dry resin
near as much as I do fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because a lot of the strains that
we've been running over here dump,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just the same as all the dry
material did over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the women peel, for example,
dirty taxi, Kim Dilla Kim, Moonbow 99 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 112.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those produce some of the craziest
resident I've ever seen when it comes down
[SPEAKER_03]: to like full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're a lot bigger heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all, you know, dumps between the 90
through, you know, 179.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting full melt, you know,
in my experience, washing dry material,
[SPEAKER_05]: all you're really going to gain is a
slight yield increase, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: sacrifice so much turps that to me,
it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just did a dry on some Mac, you know,
everyone says, Oh, that one isn't a hash
[SPEAKER_05]: strands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's turpless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say it's mild on the turps,
but, uh, I fresh froze a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I partially dried it just for my
own.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I always do fresh frozen,
but I wanted to know for myself,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is supposedly not a hash cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to try washing it fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to try washing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was a seven day dry,
um, 60 and 60, um, all grown next to each
[SPEAKER_05]: other, you know, in the same bed,
same situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's tough with percentage wise,
because, you know, I have a percentage
[SPEAKER_05]: based off of dry and a percentage based
off of, uh, wet, but I only got like 15
[SPEAKER_05]: more grams from a pound, um, washing it
partially dried.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt a little stronger on the effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like a lot of times dry material,
I don't know, affects me in a way where it
[SPEAKER_05]: seemed a little stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, like I said, there's usually
a lapse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of hard to tell with melt,
but when you rosin it, it's pretty obvious
[SPEAKER_05]: the difference in my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rosin was not as terpy as any of the
fresh frozen material was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I prefer the fresh frozen for that
reason as well, the terpian preservation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I brought up the partial cure
aspect because trying to do it like seven
[SPEAKER_07]: days is even probably a little too much
in, in my opinion, like the three to four
[SPEAKER_07]: day max.
[SPEAKER_07]: At 1660.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then bucked down and frozen and
then washed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still, I still felt like I got that
higher yield, but I also kept a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: of the terpenes than I would if I would
have dried it completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but obviously, obviously for sure,
definitely not as much with fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it kind of got to both, both best of
both worlds, at least a few times that
[SPEAKER_07]: I've experimented with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I bring it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a cure?
[SPEAKER_06]: A freezer cure then.
[SPEAKER_08]: A freezer cure?
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like a freezer, because technically,
I mean, it's a freezer is at low
[SPEAKER_08]: temperature and very low humidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you leave your material in there for
say, you know, like a month when you had
[SPEAKER_08]: other stuff to process, aren't you
somewhat curing it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, so you're, I mean,
you're removing a very tiny amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: moisture, but potentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's everybody's thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_08]: How long does everybody like to wait for
fresh frozen before you start washing it
[SPEAKER_08]: in the, before you take it out of the
freezer?
[SPEAKER_05]: For a year and a half before and washed it
and it washed amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm all doing it by myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've had stuff in my freezer for a long
time by no means am I freezing it and
[SPEAKER_05]: processing it right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a lot of times I'm just stuffing
freezers all season long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the winter I process it and
work seasonally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you about it curing in the freezer,
but at the same time, I feel like my
[SPEAKER_05]: material isn't changing all that much in a
chest freezer at negative 30 to negative
[SPEAKER_05]: 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, freezers generally preserve.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not, you know, of course,
terpenes are extremely volatile and there
[SPEAKER_10]: could be some things going on there,
but nothing compared to like room
[SPEAKER_10]: temperature, even just the cold
temperature of a fridge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezers will change the color of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, it will darken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking more like moisture,
like taking a little, not necessarily like
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes, but more of like taking a little
bit of the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause isn't that technically what freezer
burn is, is the like all the moisture has
[SPEAKER_08]: gone out of the chicken from freezing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pulled it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had material in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was from a grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did like in 2012 and I just pulled it
out like a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like old.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could, it was like, like six years old
or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pressed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just like, ah, this is just flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to press it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just got this like baby diaper,
like yellow shit that was so fucking loud
[SPEAKER_10]: that most of the people I showed it to
just could not believe that it was six
[SPEAKER_10]: year old dried bud that I squished like a
day and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I would open it and people like very
far away would be like, do you smell that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was really, really loud.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you just never know what kind of
presence and preservation you've got going
[SPEAKER_10]: on.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wouldn't have guessed it was that
extreme from this material.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a harmony, a cut I got from a
reefer man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That harmony is no joke.
[SPEAKER_10]: If any of you have ever grown back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee if you freeze whole dry sieved
heads, if you freeze it at minus 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: kept away from oxygen as much as possible
that 10, 15 years later, if it's changed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's such a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that old, old resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember the old resin that our
friend Michael had?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that was frozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, for sure not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every year that I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I started smoking it when it was
like, I don't know, 13 years old or
[SPEAKER_10]: something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I smoked it every year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Until it was like, how old did it get?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, was it like eight, 17 or 18 or
something years old?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you, did you smoke that till the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it came to, I don't know,
but I think the piece is now getting
[SPEAKER_01]: social security.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All I know about that piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was powder, like red dust, like crazy
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so pure, but it was, it was old.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't know what year that shit was
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Michael did not keep it in a
freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kept it in a suitcase in his bedroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I get people wanting to like cure
hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some hash here on my table.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 10, that's almost 10 years old
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a, it's, it's like glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like crack it open and it's,
it's real shiny.
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe I'll take a dab of that in a
bit, but it would have been nice to
[SPEAKER_10]: preserve it so that it's what you remember
years down the road.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've kept something for 10 years,
but instead of curing it and changing all
[SPEAKER_10]: of it, at least keep some in a preserved
manner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now here's something I want to bring up
for years.
[SPEAKER_10]: We cured bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: We cured bud because it was harsh when it
still had moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of those mono terpenes were more
caustic and just sort of sharp.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the bouquet of the terpenes that came
out underneath and revealed themselves as
[SPEAKER_10]: some of those monos evaporated out,
volatized off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those, that's how we always enjoyed
flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually we got into water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the first water hash I made was from
dry material.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the full melts from Renee was from
bone dry material.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was dry and it produced full melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know, you know, a lot of people
couldn't produce and really it seemed like
[SPEAKER_10]: the birth of fresh frozen was also the
birth of full melt, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: appears to be full melt, but it's really
not.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I wonder in this new generation
where we've come this full, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: 180 degrees from liking to cure things
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's smooth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember having some dry sift that I
had made out of some sweet skunk and it
[SPEAKER_10]: was like the material had been cured for
months and then I sifted and then the sift
[SPEAKER_10]: had been cured for months.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you took a dab of it,
it was just, it was full melt,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it was just so smooth and nice,
quite different from that sort of caustic
[SPEAKER_10]: like, whoa, I just took a dab of some
really fresh frozen, freeze dried,
[SPEAKER_10]: like white full melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's really terpy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wonder the differences in that,
that how we've come like, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: and when I was in Amsterdam, it was
actually Tony from Sagamarta Seeds that I
[SPEAKER_10]: bumped into Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were at like Hank's apartment above the
bulldog in the Leidseplein.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, he had been taking some,
some, some dabs and he was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't want any more.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, Oh, you know, take one of
these.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he took a dab of it and he just blew
this dab out.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no coughing and it was just
smooth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wonder what you guys have to say
about the difference between those two
[SPEAKER_10]: experiences, having a hash that you,
you know, cure the material out before you
[SPEAKER_10]: wash it, wash it and cure that for a
little bit versus let's save every single
[SPEAKER_10]: terpene, the ones that would have normally
evaporated off in the drying process and
[SPEAKER_10]: let's, let's contain them all and,
and instead, you know, breathe all of
[SPEAKER_10]: those in for, for the dab experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: The difference between those two things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Surely you guys have experienced that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a good example is that every year
when I, cause I used to smoke lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I've smoked hash for the last 25,
30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, I smoked massive amounts of
ganja and I grew it up in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I harvested it every year,
my voice, I would get laryngitis from
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed that had dried for two weeks
and I couldn't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it was really, really potent
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really loud cannabis like either
skunk or haze or one of those type things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guarantee you, every year for five,
six years in a row, I got laryngitis at
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving when it was the new harvest
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it was because of the terps,
but it was, it could have also been partly
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plant material itself was not
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was barely dry enough,
but it wasn't cured at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're definitely smoking a different
profile of terpenes than we ever had in
[SPEAKER_10]: our history, just freshly in this last 20
years, starting to do extracts,
[SPEAKER_10]: different ratios, forget about the adding
of, of cannabis extracted terpenes or the
[SPEAKER_10]: infamous fruit terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're definitely inhaling differently
in the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wonder how that'll affect us
inhaling terpene profiles that maybe we,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe we haven't been inhaling for the
last like 40 to 50 years because that bud
[SPEAKER_10]: was cured and that, you know, the flower
was, it was always about being cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's really all about preservation
of the entire profile from the time you
[SPEAKER_10]: cut the plant down, your flash freezing
it, you're washing it, freeze drying that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very little heat can be exposed to that
over the course of its life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you have this terpene profile that
I guarantee you is quite different from
[SPEAKER_10]: the terpene profile of the same cured
flower or hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is smoking higher terpene
concentrations doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes are caustic, you know,
and I know not necessarily for hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some of the like BHO sauce,
they're getting crazy high terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know at least for me, when I inhale that
stuff, man, it, it makes my lungs not
[SPEAKER_02]: super happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's super terp hit,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for, for Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you notice a different, a difference in
say terps or terpenes in profiles in the
[SPEAKER_04]: air dried versus freeze dried hash?
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly, there's a reason why
everybody's freeze drying, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's, it's super rare to get
air dried hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, like what year was that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Whenever the freeze dryer just banged
everybody over, like, it was just like,
[SPEAKER_13]: what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody has amazing perfectly dried
resin back to back to back to back to
[SPEAKER_13]: back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas it was like, a struggle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only been about two years since a
freeze dryer came out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_10]: If Fletcher was in here, Fletcher really
was one of the first people just
[SPEAKER_10]: suggesting a freeze dryer.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, but I mean, like when it's spread
out, I mean, you know, this is just my
[SPEAKER_13]: experience from Northern California.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd go to Emerald Cup and then that's
where a lot of people obviously travel and
[SPEAKER_13]: seeing all of that hash all of a sudden
from a freeze dryer was just like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, for me it was like 2015 to like
2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you went from a bunch of hand
dried hash entries to the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like one, if that, and it was
just, everything was freeze dried hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like overnight kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got mine in 2015 after I saw Michigan
made melts at it and was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to buy a back oven to do Cuban
tech and I was like, well, that's cold.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's maybe what I want to do more so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, keep in mind, I'm, you know,
I'm just, it's a seasonal garden.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's seasonal work for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't have the balls to buy a
freeze dryer and put the melt through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I don't want to, because I know that
it's a really efficient tool, but
[SPEAKER_13]: sometimes it can be a little too
efficient.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like, I just haven't been able to do
that trial and error yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure one day I will, you know,
but yeah, I'm still air drying everything
[SPEAKER_13]: by hand with a microplane because like,
uh, Marcus was bringing up earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I think that sometimes water can
leach or maybe not leach, but maybe water
[SPEAKER_13]: can sometimes go in that trichome and
maybe not all trichomes are perfect.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I shred them up with a microplane
and like, they're not all shredded up.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some that aren't.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like really cool to look at the
pictures that where it's like,
[SPEAKER_13]: well, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I took a microplane to this and this
thing should be shredded straight in half,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's completely whole.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like what's going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, you know, there's a, there's a
finesse and a sleight of hand technique to
[SPEAKER_13]: drying, air drying.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I haven't seen the side to side
enough to know all I know is that freeze
[SPEAKER_13]: drying is, is, uh, it changed the game.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and, uh, yeah, no, I, I, to answer the
question better, I haven't seen enough
[SPEAKER_13]: side-by-side work, especially with myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't, I, I'm very ignorant when it
comes to the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I, I've never used one personally.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've just heard everybody's experience and
tried to, um, If you want to do some
[SPEAKER_10]: research on them, you should, uh,
Google lyophilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did side by side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was about 2016 when I first got
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still doing most of my first run,
you know, melt quote unquote melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hand still microplaning and hand
drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like my later runs, I was
throwing in the freeze dryer so I could
[SPEAKER_02]: press them literally the next day,
you know, to make rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I did it with the 24K and,
uh, I know I didn't have, I guess the best
[SPEAKER_02]: place to air dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on racks in an open room,
no HEPA filter kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was pretty, pretty legit
situation, but it could be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I honestly preferred the freeze
dried hash in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the air dried, it was on the rack
seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's some people getting their
microplane hash dried quicker than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing two weeks dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just my experience on that, you know,
that one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_10]: What were you drawing it on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have it on parchment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it on a lined, yeah, parchment
lined, uh, cookie rack sheets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So parchment's not a desiccant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you created the area, the surface area
for it to dry, but you only allowed it to
[SPEAKER_10]: air dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had you used the desiccant to pull the
water out?
[SPEAKER_10]: Which gravity helps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus it's just water will always kind of
settle down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you give it something that it can
absorb into, it'll absorb dry,
[SPEAKER_10]: absorb dry, and it dries like very
differently than in, than if you don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of said that from early days.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, what happened was when we start,
you know, I ended up showing people,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, drying on like pizza boxes or
whatever, because I was in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_10]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you wanted a hope of getting your
hash dry, especially in like November,
[SPEAKER_10]: December, when it's just like pouring,
you know, 50 millimeters of rain every
[SPEAKER_10]: day, you can't even believe how much
fucking rain it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you really need to have the help of a
desiccant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Nickatee started making hash
maybe like eight to 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and it was like, he was like,
Oh, you don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you can just do it like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just like, bro, you're in
Colorado where it's really dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you tell people in the Pacific
Northwest that they don't need to do that
[SPEAKER_10]: and that they can just do this,
it's not going to work out.
[SPEAKER_10]: For them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that really began that dialogue and
that conversation of we're not all in the
[SPEAKER_10]: same environments.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our terroirs are different and we have to
act accordingly to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we do things like drying hash,
does a lyophilization oven or a freeze
[SPEAKER_10]: dryer take the, uh, some of the worry out
of that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, especially if you're,
uh, selling to a market, whether it be rec
[SPEAKER_10]: or medical, medical for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: A freeze dryer is going to ensure that not
one single chunk of your hash was
[SPEAKER_10]: microplained or sieved too large,
held enough water to, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: create microbial content and, you know,
potentially offer someone something they
[SPEAKER_10]: didn't need, you know, particularly if
they were patients and already immune
[SPEAKER_10]: compromised or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_10]: So freeze dryers do have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think that the harvest rights are,
are, are kind of like cute little toys.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're great for the beginning of our
industry, but when you get into actual
[SPEAKER_10]: production, you're going to get into,
you know, something like a mill rock,
[SPEAKER_10]: a large scale unit, because here's the
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You start making large scale water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: You start getting that machine to be able
to do really large runs and make many,
[SPEAKER_10]: many, many kilos a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your limitation won't be in the size of
your unit or in your biomass or in your
[SPEAKER_10]: ice production or in your ability to
condition your water, it will be in your
[SPEAKER_10]: freeze dryer rack space.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be your limitation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you want it, you know,
if you feel that you have the ability to
[SPEAKER_10]: produce a lot of good hash, that's going
to require freeze drying because there are
[SPEAKER_10]: other alternatives.
[SPEAKER_10]: If hash isn't going to be melty here in
Canada, what we do with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my partner, Daniel at Whistler
Technologies, uh, came up with this with
[SPEAKER_10]: a, with his partner, Brishna.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and they basically just figured out
quite a while ago that, Hey, why don't we,
[SPEAKER_10]: if we could get, and the reason they did
this was Canada was stuck in a place where
[SPEAKER_10]: you couldn't sell hash, but you could take
the hash that you made and infuse it into
[SPEAKER_10]: a plant fat and sell it in a 30 ml vial
with a particular, you know, it has to be
[SPEAKER_10]: somewhat diluted.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very small amount of cannabinoids per
ml.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was Canada, uh, for the last three or
four years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's changed now, uh, with rec and
medical kind of opening up bigger,
[SPEAKER_10]: but that's the way it was, uh,
at the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, don't let me lose my train of thought
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: That robot voice threw me off for a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what was that?
[SPEAKER_10]: So Daniel and Brishna came up with for
Whistler Technologies to start the
[SPEAKER_10]: company, to sell a unit to Whistler
Medical and for them to say, listen,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can take this hash and because you
can't dry it and sell it as a hash
[SPEAKER_10]: product, what you can do is you can get
our Terp reactor, which is about 200
[SPEAKER_10]: litres and you can infuse plant fats.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can infuse bubble, fresh bubble.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bubble never dries.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what you end up with, once you filter
the map through a membrane and remove all
[SPEAKER_10]: the water and the waxes and end up with
this really beautiful, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: hash, hash infused oil, you end up with a
terpene content that is about two times
[SPEAKER_10]: higher than the majority of the companies
in Canada that are selling these infused
[SPEAKER_10]: oils.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one of the sort of technologies
that Whistler Technologies helped to make
[SPEAKER_10]: bubble hash a commercial thing is that,
you know, you don't want to sacrifice your
[SPEAKER_10]: quality if it's there, but you want your
workhorse to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if there's no quality and there's
some, some, you know, three to four star
[SPEAKER_10]: hash, we can certainly still run it and
infuse it into plant fats and produce this
[SPEAKER_10]: really great high terpene plant content
extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was one of the things that he did
that really sort of inspired me about
[SPEAKER_10]: being coming a part of the company,
because it was one of the things that
[SPEAKER_10]: kept, you know, as all of you know,
as hash makers, it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_10]: sometimes make a business with just
making, you know, water hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: because unless you have a really great
connection, you know, before rosin came
[SPEAKER_10]: into play, when you really had to deal
with the hash that you had, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: that was an amazing method to just take
that hash very fresh, don't dry it,
[SPEAKER_10]: infuse it into plant fat, decarboxylate it
under a vacuum, and then filter it through
[SPEAKER_10]: a membrane to get all that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the very medicine that my own
mother who worked for the police for 30
[SPEAKER_10]: plus years as a 911 operator, my own
mother uses that product, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: via Whistler Technologies through Whistler
Medical, and just orders it off the
[SPEAKER_10]: internet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: 1133, I'd rock this out for another half
hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you guys want to twist and change
direction, or if you want to keep on this
[SPEAKER_10]: direction, I think all of these topics are
great.
[SPEAKER_10]: So great that I'm going to have to make
like a once a month water hash,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, panel where we get like 30 to 40
of us on a list.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then whoever can make it each month,
each, you know, that one week a month can
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of put their name in the in the pile,
because I think there's a lot to talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about with with hash making.
[SPEAKER_10]: And clearly, we're all obsessed and
geeking out on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a spiritual thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to see what breeders people were
like in working with for finding like hash
[SPEAKER_19]: specific cultivars.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Swamp boys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Swamp boys go hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: The new work has been really on point
seems like stable work even and skunk VA
[SPEAKER_14]: actually for some getting, you know,
gassy gear turn and Crockett's family
[SPEAKER_14]: under DNA and Crockett.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did a tasty ways from swamp boys
that turned out really good did like 5.3%
[SPEAKER_08]: melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: So not the best but really nice kind of
had like a chemi GMO flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: The 91 Royale I just turned actually,
it's not my favorite, but one of two Finos
[SPEAKER_14]: just was tacky, fresh, frozen,
couldn't couldn't do much with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like really, really, really gluey
even.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice problem to have.
[SPEAKER_10]: It involves some trickery, especially if
you're going to see shit like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You better leave moisture content in your
patty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't let that shit wick out on the
pressing screen with some paper towels
[SPEAKER_10]: under there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll walk away for two minutes and come
back and have a fucking pizza.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hubba bubba gum that's pressed itself into
a gummy sticky mass.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you're now you're microplaning no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone else for breeders?
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Stunk Man Sam?
[SPEAKER_17]: I would do well with exotic genetics also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exotics, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exotics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had good luck with Oni Keiko as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Archive does really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Archive, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to get some more seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We ran some King's Stash actually that was
fire that made really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watched a bunch of that the other
day.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: What cake is Jesse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bio Vortex.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bio Vortex?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's write it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm making the list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Checking it twice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gonna find out who's naughty or nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: D Junkie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cush cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: His hidden pastries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those did really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely worth washing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed all the seed Junkie gear for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oni's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got Dark Horse as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thug Pug, Vessel of Life Science just
texted me.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, Thug Pug's been killing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go Vessel, I did.
[SPEAKER_13]: All I heard was Vortex.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't found a way yet, but I'm gonna
start.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that it's being opened up to share
strains and I'm finding the good cultivars
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have in-house, I'll find some way
to share them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: At least, you know, we're folding into
adult use at the farm in the main this
[SPEAKER_14]: really soon this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking for a vote in June, but we're
doing medical only right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Would love to share some of the hash plan
type cultivars from us outward and look to
[SPEAKER_14]: do that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harry Palms is another really good one to
mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about Oni, he's doing his own
thing now, but yeah, Harry Palms.
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes some really good hash trays.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what he was thinking when he
chose that name.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm gonna be, I'm a cannabis
creator.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna rock the Harry Palms name.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote him down, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sour Dove and GMO from Harry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just black garlic the other day and
it did really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also got a Wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about some old school Doc Atomic,
Spice of Life, DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like a lot of Bodhi's gear too.
[SPEAKER_19]: The cam, really good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like the cam dog crossed with the ADA G13
hash plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that a lot, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got some greenhouse seeds in the house
actually from in our gear.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my clementine cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Lemon Haze has worked into that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's very, super loud on the lemon side.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the favorite for the turp,
but very, very loudest thing around.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Super Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of Greece down in southern Oregon,
Cushkirk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another you didn't mention as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude fucking crushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some global punch here from Brandon
that's freaking amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say, he gave me seeds of
that and we ran it here in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: and it did absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just laced us with a whole grip of some
series.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a great guy and he's breeding
tons of crazy genetics out where he's at,
[SPEAKER_03]: all for resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check him out for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_19]: The most lepton breeder, I think.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about growing your own food and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: This man, he lives on that farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: His kitchen is outside in the hoop house.
[SPEAKER_03]: His alpacas feed, everything that he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's amending soil all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a crazy thing to go check that man
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go follow him on Instagram, Cushkirk,
because he's crushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and Scott were the ones that taught me
everything I know about making a full
[SPEAKER_03]: melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cushkirk, is that what you said?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Cushkirk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the real OGKB too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I invited him to this.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was one of the people that never got
back to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not, but Dragonfly Earth Medicine
hooked me up with Ganjagil and Cushkirk's
[SPEAKER_10]: email, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have to go to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of us will have to go to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll send you out into the world with the
SAT computer, do some live streaming.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine, definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sent me a video of Ganjagil and
Cushkirk sitting and talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivars and hash making.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough with Brandon,
with that guy, Cushkirk, learning how to
[SPEAKER_03]: make hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a crazy thing to get to spend all
that time with him at his garden and
[SPEAKER_03]: washing material and seeing how he lives
his life every day and having him explain
[SPEAKER_03]: to me what the plant means to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That process was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about it all the time and how
grateful I am to be able to get to go in
[SPEAKER_03]: and share that experience with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was truly life-changing, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, I was just going to say that
visiting his farm, we went up there for
[SPEAKER_02]: the harvest party this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit literally changed my life,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave me a new breath of life coming out
of his property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, living the dream, straight up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll definitely get Cushkirk in the house
one of these days, if it works out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone else want to bring anything up for
the last 20 minutes or so?
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got 20 more minutes to rock and roll
on this hash episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say something about the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a breeder, but I really like it
whenever people are trying to find those
[SPEAKER_13]: cultivars that work well with the water
hash or just hash making.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because a lot of them aren't.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of them that we probably love or the
smell is amazing, it's just going to wash
[SPEAKER_13]: right down the disposal.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be a total waste to make hash out of
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can sift genetics and try to find
maybe similar or maybe it's the same
[SPEAKER_13]: profile as the one that's washing down the
disposal, but it's now viable in the bag
[SPEAKER_13]: set.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really awesome what's going on these
days actually with the hashing to lend
[SPEAKER_14]: back into the better strain work in the
new polyhybrid day that we're in for
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: At least personally, it's seeing the
resins get pulled out this way naturally,
[SPEAKER_14]: real raw, and then feeding it back into
which type of cultivars we're looking for,
[SPEAKER_14]: what we're trying to produce to create
those.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really teaching me a lot as a breeder
and cultivator with the bubble hash being
[SPEAKER_14]: made with that R&D.
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes back and forth with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also breeding for your environment just
seems totally smart if you're able to do
[SPEAKER_13]: such things.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not only setting yourself apart
from the rest, but it seems like it'd be
[SPEAKER_13]: just a better model if you're at that
level.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say it's definitely
important to find cultivars that do well
[SPEAKER_12]: in your climate where you're at.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our GMO went through three or four frosts
this year, froze solid, and then sprung
[SPEAKER_12]: back the next day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was ready to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fresh frozen, baby.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rock all ready to go.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real question is have you guys been
sitting in the cold room the whole time?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our work room here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see you breathing out.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like you're hella cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like you've been in there for an
hour and a half, two hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget about an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been three hours we've been talking
about our love of hash, cultivars,
[SPEAKER_10]: and flavors.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that I've mentioned this
before, maybe not super recently,
[SPEAKER_10]: but one of the things my company,
Embark Health, wants to do is in close
[SPEAKER_10]: conjunction with the tissue culture
company like Segri International,
[SPEAKER_10]: is to collect our data between the two of
us, between the growers who are producing,
[SPEAKER_10]: the way they're growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get as many data inputs as possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we're making the hash, when we're
making ... There's seven varieties of
[SPEAKER_10]: extraction available at our facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be running the solventless
portion of it, the dry sift and mechanical
[SPEAKER_10]: water extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then rosin and maybe some terpene
extractions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Collecting all of that data will really
help uncover more of these cultivars and
[SPEAKER_10]: really start understanding the cultivars,
not based on someone's name because it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: specific cut, but starting to understand
them under the chemoveric makeup that they
[SPEAKER_10]: actually are, which is really what they
are to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_10]: What are they together?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because to me, that's what that cultivar
is.
[SPEAKER_10]: With people naming things so many
different names and having so many
[SPEAKER_10]: different cuts and making mistakes and
even just being deceptive, it really
[SPEAKER_10]: spoils the pot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the idea of us getting to a point
where something easy, where you can just
[SPEAKER_10]: test and be like, oh, this is that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can connect it to the name still,
but the name will be secondary.
[SPEAKER_10]: The chemoveric makeup of the plant will be
first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who grows it makes a huge difference in
what you're going to find when you go into
[SPEAKER_02]: the washroom with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given my 24K cut out to a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow it outside in Leightonville,
which is in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get maybe seven full hours of sun a day
in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given it to my friends who grow it in
a different microclimate that gets a
[SPEAKER_02]: little warmer and they get direct sun from
sun up to sun down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing basically the same soil mix
that I am, same feeding program I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit about three and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off my garden, I hit five and a half to
six percent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your turps are better probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: My all around mine's better.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, that's part of the data.
[SPEAKER_10]: Collecting and running 100 or 200
different growers, all of that data will
[SPEAKER_10]: be collected.
[SPEAKER_10]: How did they grow it?
[SPEAKER_10]: What was their climate?
[SPEAKER_10]: What was their climate?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it indoor?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it outdoor?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it organic?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it salt grown?
[SPEAKER_10]: All of these things will feed into that
data plan because at that point,
[SPEAKER_10]: it'll be like, well, where are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because these are cultivars that have been
grown around you and these are cultivars
[SPEAKER_10]: that have been grown around you in using
the methodologies that are similar to what
[SPEAKER_10]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of data points.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just excited at creating something
like a digital landscape out of those data
[SPEAKER_10]: points that can be navigated to give us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a stack from this year of
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just keep track of our runs,
what we pull, when it was ran,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as many data points as you're
talking about, but it's fun to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: go back and look at the same strain grown
in different areas or just different
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions at your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say the July depth versus a late season
depth or a full term plant and just the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences.
[SPEAKER_10]: Terroir has a big play on how things grow
and it'll give people their unique aspect
[SPEAKER_10]: in this world cannabis community and
industry because you might live in a
[SPEAKER_10]: terroir that just produces something
unique and different from other terroirs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's generally how it works.
[SPEAKER_10]: Things find a place where they shine the
most.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the data points really go back to
what Sam was saying at the beginning too
[SPEAKER_17]: with you need to automate things.
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to have all those data points
move and do that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Even to where things are growing,
different areas, we take in a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: things from a lot of different parts of
the state.
[SPEAKER_17]: I see a lot of the same different strains
come out a lot different from different
[SPEAKER_17]: areas of the state.
[SPEAKER_17]: Keeping all the different data and all
that stuff, I think goes back to exactly
[SPEAKER_17]: what you're saying where you need to keep
them as detailed as possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: What the soil it's grown in, if it's salt
grown, if it's not, we try to keep all
[SPEAKER_17]: that data.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think like you said, it's going to be
what's important at the end.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll help us navigate the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll help us not make silly mistakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: An example I use all the time when people
are like, well, how are your different
[SPEAKER_10]: modalities of extraction going to help any
company that's growing?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, well, a really basic example
would be that say you were wanting to do
[SPEAKER_10]: dry sift and you were a grower and you
didn't really realize that as a grower who
[SPEAKER_10]: wants to do dry sift, it's probably going
to be best that you get a cultivar that
[SPEAKER_10]: produces the majority of the trichomes are
capitate stock and capitate sessile.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bulbous heads tend to just stick to
the leaves and they're not as effective at
[SPEAKER_10]: coming off with mechanical screen
separations or even water extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've also often noticed because I'd see
these oil guys go, oh yeah, we're getting
[SPEAKER_10]: a 25% yield and I'm like, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because like the same water hash,
same material is getting like a 14% to 15
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's dry, the true return.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wondered why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_10]: Then what I put it together was that
they're accessing, what they thought back
[SPEAKER_10]: in the day was that they were accessing
resin that was inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, from what I had learned from
science, that wasn't really something that
[SPEAKER_10]: was happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: I learned that all the resin was being
created inside the glandular trichome,
[SPEAKER_10]: inside that little sort of laboratory.
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured out with my macro photography,
look, these bulbous heads are sticking
[SPEAKER_10]: around even after they're washed.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cultivars like Renee and the ones that
really rained like hash plants for me,
[SPEAKER_10]: were ones that had very small percentage
of those heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would macro photograph some people's
plants and I'd swear 50% of the heads on
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant were these bulbous heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought, wow, now imagine you're a big
company.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to make dry sift and you roll the
dice wrong and you get a cultivar that
[SPEAKER_10]: just has 50% of these bulbous heads and
you put all this investment and time and
[SPEAKER_10]: money into it and you're trying to grow
great weed and dry it and cure it
[SPEAKER_10]: properly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now when you just start doing your
sifting, you're like, we're only getting
[SPEAKER_10]: like a five or a 6% yields.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, yeah, you would have been
getting a 12 to a 15% yield had you just
[SPEAKER_10]: understood that these different types of
trichomes are accessible in different
[SPEAKER_10]: ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm excited to sort of create those
data points as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that we hadn't touched on much
either that I think plays a huge part is
[SPEAKER_04]: just harvest and prep and storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is honestly just as big as
your whole run throughout the whole year
[SPEAKER_04]: and your wash and your dry too,
just because I've noticed a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: differences in the gardens and not only
yield and quality, but even just at the
[SPEAKER_04]: time I harvested a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to harvest plants later in the
afternoon and at nighttime and try and
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest in the colder hours just because
I've noticed when I pulled stuff in the
[SPEAKER_04]: daytime or early mornings and it just
starts to get hot while you're working and
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing fresh frozen that stuff just
starts to get sticky and almost grease in
[SPEAKER_04]: the bags and it just makes it a lot harder
to work with when you put it in water and
[SPEAKER_04]: ice and get stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one of the things I've noticed
with outdoor resin and full sun resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it goes back to that chef SOP.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to make sure your grower is doing
that through and through because we've all
[SPEAKER_10]: seen triple A or quads or whatever they're
calling it now, 10 A's in a row or
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: The highest quality herb can really be
deteriorated by multiple grade points by
[SPEAKER_10]: being improperly cured and improperly
stored.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that sort of post-processing,
that pre-processing, getting it ready and
[SPEAKER_10]: preparing it, I think the grower and the
hash maker really have to have a line of
[SPEAKER_09]: communication there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the prep work is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going from two facilities that are on the
rec market and seeing two different ways
[SPEAKER_03]: of prepping material, it makes a huge
difference versus putting it in all trays,
[SPEAKER_03]: stacking it up real high and letting the
resin sit on each other versus harvesting
[SPEAKER_03]: straight off the plant in a cold room,
in a cold grow room that's dark,
[SPEAKER_03]: straight into small freezer bags that go
right into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the method that we really prefer to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same people, the same few people
doing it every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is all in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lab that I wash it is feet away
from where all the resin is being grown,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's easy to be able to see the plants,
see the material, see how it's being
[SPEAKER_03]: handled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes multiple freezers to do that,
to store 100,000 grams of fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_03]: takes a couple large freezers to keep it
in small bags spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not putting a bunch of material
on top of each other and compromising the
[SPEAKER_03]: material.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important if you are trying to
make full melt and not just a rosin grade
[SPEAKER_03]: production, you know, hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big difference in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, I've seen 100,000 grams slammed
into one freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you that shit was kind of a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was like, yeah, like a fucking
ice cube.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to do the longest soak on it just
to get the those bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no pulling melt off this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got rid of the 90 and 120 bag,
caught it all in the 70, pressed it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, yeah, dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be overpacking those
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be doing bags that are
too heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can leave the middle of the day
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst time is fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can smell the turps getting
cooked off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the resin just smearing all
over everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just flying everywhere, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Prepare your plant matter properly and
make sure that people aren't doing stupid
[SPEAKER_10]: shit with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're not the source of your plant
matter, definitely have access to the
[SPEAKER_10]: grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd want to be going and having full
access to be able to test anything I
[SPEAKER_10]: wanted to, to be able to look at anything
I wanted to open any door or drawer I want
[SPEAKER_10]: to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just know that the cannabis is
being properly grown.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it hasn't or wasn't, that's OK,
too, because those are really important
[SPEAKER_10]: lessons where you can kind of learn.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's OK if you're doing it wrong,
because doing it wrong is literally how
[SPEAKER_10]: you learn how to do it right.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that isn't the craziest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't feel bad if you are doing it
wrong out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of good points that people
have dropped today in regards to genetics
[SPEAKER_10]: and breeders and little tips and tricks
and pre-propressing and processing posts
[SPEAKER_10]: with sieving and microplaning.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was kind of space on the microplaning.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they're very different things.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's lots of different good information
that's been dropped today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely want to come back to do more of
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Want to apologize to the entire group of
rosin people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had, geez, let me see.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Will Rackhams.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's just been working the entire time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Word.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Covert Extracts, Pedro's Grow Room,
Roxy Gray, Ogre Resins, Dogman Troupe,
[SPEAKER_10]: and Goldilocks who made it in for the
hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't have to apologize to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But sorry to those guys and gals that we
didn't make it in today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate your understanding.
[SPEAKER_10]: The hash conversation just seemed to be
able to go the full three hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll just plan it for next week.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we'll get to 15 or so people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I already have eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's room for some more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Want to hit me up on Instagram or some of
these guys in the panel want to do it,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can hit me up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all for coming in from Best
Friend Farms to Goldilocks to Taste of
[SPEAKER_10]: Cascade, True Hash Company to Heavy Ice
and Great Lake Grease, Wook Sauce Winery
[SPEAKER_10]: and Resident Ranch Extractions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Adam Lee Simpson and Dammit Bobby
Rackhams, of course, and Ganjigil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Set in the tone with the like,
this means more to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_10]: It means more to me, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it takes me down many different
avenues, but the source has always been
[SPEAKER_10]: that it means more to me as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why I give it a great deal of
respect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Treat it like the queen that it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just try and see everyone have access
to this beautiful, beautiful plant and
[SPEAKER_10]: resin that we are also obsessed with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, thanks, everyone,
for hanging out on this Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make sure to have you guys back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys want to shout out where you
can be found on Instagram, I think that
[SPEAKER_10]: would be fair.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll also put it in the comments section
and I'll also post it in the comments of
[SPEAKER_10]: the Spotify, Google and Apple podcast
sites that this will be showing up in on
[SPEAKER_10]: the next few hours.
