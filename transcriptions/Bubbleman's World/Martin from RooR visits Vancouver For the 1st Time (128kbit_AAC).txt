[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I'm
just here at the Vancouver International
[SPEAKER_04]: Airport And I'm picking up a good friend
of mine who I have actually never seen in
[SPEAKER_04]: on the west coast in Canada and I've seen
him in Toronto at the champs show and I've
[SPEAKER_04]: seen him all over Europe from Germany to
Amsterdam to Switzerland to London to
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain he's been at all the shows he's been
around a little bit longer than my company
[SPEAKER_04]: his company is called Ruhr from
frankenthal Germany and of course I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about Martin Bissell so he's
coming in right away on Lufthansa Air I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: picking him up I figured I'd have a little
bit of a session before we get things
[SPEAKER_04]: going here planes and helicopters all over
the place but it's to be expected at the
[SPEAKER_04]: airport isn't it so yeah I've just got my
car parked up around here waiting for him
[SPEAKER_04]: to arrive and yeah I think we're pretty
good yeah I'm good I guess we're gonna go
[SPEAKER_04]: grab the rig have a quick dab here on the
bench and then we'll head up and grab
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin sound good all right guys so I'm
here at the airport sort of I guess
[SPEAKER_04]: they've got these little beautiful
hangouts sort of all around the airport
[SPEAKER_04]: and being a federally licensed cannabis
user I'm suspecting that it's more than
[SPEAKER_04]: legal for me to come here there's no kids
there's no people run to interrupt and
[SPEAKER_04]: just have a quick quick dab I got some
D420k dry sift there for you guys oh yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: thank you D420k bro of bros that guy is
bro of bros DC glass banger on the Taurus
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't have any water didn't really want
to go around looking for water so just
[SPEAKER_04]: going to take a quick little rip right
here on the on the bench
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna go for a dunk
[SPEAKER_04]: dunkaroo airport rips nothing like airport
rips to get yourself in the right state of
[SPEAKER_04]: mind to head into the actual building
whistles happening gotta love the
[SPEAKER_04]: mothership even with no water in it this
thing hits like a champ so we guess next
[SPEAKER_04]: stop head in here see if we can't go find
Martin all
[SPEAKER_04]: right all right guys I managed to find
Martin in the airport welcome to Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: man hey welcome to Vancouver you've been
to Canada before yeah great great yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: this first time first time in Vancouver so
Martin as you guys know or if you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know is the the owner and operator of roar
German glass blowing company in
[SPEAKER_04]: Frankenthal Germany and yeah we've had
some good adventures over the last she's
[SPEAKER_01]: close to 20 years this year we have it's
my 20th anniversary this year yeah they
[SPEAKER_01]: will be coming up some celebration mine as
well my first booth at the cup was 95 if
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis the first cannabis list this
was my first public have you been there
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah of course that's probably where we
met because I had a the cannabis business
[SPEAKER_04]: in what was it 90 97 or the cannabis
business in Dortmund yes but this was 1995
[SPEAKER_01]: was the first one I'm sure yeah 1995 okay
okay that's why I have 20 years this year
[SPEAKER_01]: is 2015 yes yes my first cannabis cup in
Amsterdam also was in 1995 and it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: accidental that was not planned so I mean
I made this for years there's no name and
[SPEAKER_01]: I find out the child needs to have a name
so that you know what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: right so otherwise this is just a piece of
glass yeah sure was like in any other area
[SPEAKER_01]: of the market it was very uncommon a jeans
with no name a car with no name sure
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody would accept that you know watch
with no name so it took a few years to
[SPEAKER_01]: give it a name it took me like one two
years to find that I I I hit my I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the name but I had my vision what it
should be should I like timeless summer
[SPEAKER_01]: rain and show some yes some kind of design
some timeless design you know I love that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a palindrome and so we had so many
suggestions and those who I know I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to have like the double meaning sing in it
because especially in our industry you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's often this double meaning
absolutely if you make it intelligent then
[SPEAKER_01]: it stays here like forever I know the
double meaning I know the story is the raw
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like a tube it's a very cool but even
the name you told me years ago about how
[SPEAKER_01]: you found that name and he was like
hysteria so I find it was marco slanted
[SPEAKER_01]: from the road shop in Darmstadt it was
what marks German you bring him to Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: and then started selling his book in
German was the first language and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the word that you saw the word
microorganism not easy disease the word
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganism was on a title from the book
which said the biology of microorganism
[SPEAKER_01]: this was the book about was on the title
so if you say that word microorganism
[SPEAKER_04]: right you say it enough times you'll
you'll hear the word roar in there
[SPEAKER_04]: microorganism it's the it's at the end of
micro and at the start of organism you get
[SPEAKER_04]: RO and OR and the rest is history roar
we're going to actually be showing some
[SPEAKER_04]: rural pipes in a little bit a few
historical pieces from the past but we
[SPEAKER_04]: just thought we'd kind of let you guys
know that we made it back to the hotel
[SPEAKER_04]: we're in downtown Vancouver we stopped off
at Eden in a couple of days we'll be doing
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 but before that tomorrow we're going
to be at the great northern extraction the
[SPEAKER_04]: first annual so this is a little thing
that they're putting on I guess I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know if it's with Eden in conjunction but
we went to Eden today this is the first
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary Martin ever seen in Vancouver
and they gave us a bunch of really nice
[SPEAKER_04]: things actually we got what did we get we
got well these are packs so there's
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously like entries for solvent and
solvent list entries but then we also this
[SPEAKER_04]: one's not mine mine's over here that one's
for Enrico and then they also gave us all
[SPEAKER_04]: sorts of little candies little droplets
ganja droplets a couple of cookies some
[SPEAKER_04]: nice chocolate chip peanut butter cookies
and then also some really nice chocolates
[SPEAKER_04]: really nice pieces of homemade chocolates
so edibles and extracts never a bad thing
[SPEAKER_01]: right legalization or the open how this is
dealt with you can this is pretty amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to Germany or other parts of
Europe or the world so you're pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: here keep on fighting for it so if you
think it's pretty good comes over the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean when it's we ate every day in Canada
in North America it's now it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: in the media but the politicians don't
react yet so well it's gonna happen in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany no doubt about it you know it's
just a matter of Germany's a tough a tough
[SPEAKER_04]: nut to crack like you said there's a lot
of history there and you know you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: really for instance when we came out well
even when I picked Martin up at the
[SPEAKER_04]: airport we walked out across the street
and I could tell he probably wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a one of his American spirits he'd
been on a 12 plus 10 hour flight with
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting and whatnot maybe more and so we I
just said oh let's just walk right over
[SPEAKER_04]: here and literally within like 30 seconds
of walking out the airport we're in this
[SPEAKER_04]: naturey beautiful zone and I actually had
a little of Horatio's delimiting extract
[SPEAKER_04]: so I was able to put a little tiny dab on
the American spirit form so nice way to
[SPEAKER_01]: land in Vancouver yeah it's definitely
very good to see that and so I already
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you should probably think positive
so when we know it wasn't gonna be happen
[SPEAKER_01]: one day we should have something to
present them to start with or to organize
[SPEAKER_01]: like the first cup or the first something
like yeah absolutely right away that'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: the big thing they do something trust me
it happens fast nowadays you know it might
[SPEAKER_04]: be like all like closed off and no one's
doing it but the minute it blows yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I say we should probably start
thinking about what to do so he's maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: internationally also do something you know
you will 100% be inspired by 420 in two
[SPEAKER_04]: days because there's gonna be there's
literally like I don't even know how many
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of people but it's just really
quite an impressive Vancouver's 420 is
[SPEAKER_04]: always good we're gonna be down there of
course I've got a booth down there with
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny B Martin's gonna be down with the
sublimator booth but it's already as it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems so I looked a little bit up in the
internet about the history and the last
[SPEAKER_01]: days from this 420 in Vancouver so it's
like organic grown there's people who
[SPEAKER_01]: support that to finance that to fight for
it yeah I thought about doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this in Europe but you cannot bring
it like a Rolling Stones concert to every
[SPEAKER_01]: place it's different based on the people
who fight it so they think oh no I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: say that in public because of the legal
situation which is which is unfortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: which is unfortunate and then what
happened to that dab did you roll it all
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cigarette no no no there's still a
little dab left this was was that the I
[SPEAKER_04]: sticked it on yeah this was if I sticked
it on top of this I'm pretty sure I know
[SPEAKER_04]: what it is yeah it's Barb first one we
pulled out how funny is that the first one
[SPEAKER_04]: we pulled out pioneers man pioneers so
yeah we've got flat 421 coming down here
[SPEAKER_04]: he's gonna be bringing a few roar pieces
from back in the day a few collabs with
[SPEAKER_04]: some well-known artists and yeah we're
just super stoked to to have Martin in in
[SPEAKER_04]: the city I mean literally I've been
bumping into this guy at cannabis cups for
[SPEAKER_04]: so many years 20 plus years and although
we've had any business was the first show
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe after that they came in
Switzerland and then yeah yeah and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: at all the way to Holland Canada trade
finally to Spain yeah and finally to Spain
[SPEAKER_04]: La Fiera was the first Spanish one I did
back in 2002 or 3 I said they have this
[SPEAKER_01]: year already 15 years anniversary or also
something or 10 years oh
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah nice and delicious that was great all
right well we'll be back in a bit we're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna continue to puff some bowls and when
we come back we'll have flat 421 with us
[SPEAKER_04]: all right so we're back we made it back
and flat 421 in the house everyone yes I
[SPEAKER_04]: guess you're gonna take us through a
little memory lane here yeah I'm with
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin in town I thought it would be
rather enjoyable to go back down memory
[SPEAKER_03]: lane from some of the old heavy roars that
I have them some of the older ones I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: Roar has been synonymous with the top of
the glass game since well since they came
[SPEAKER_03]: up 95 and even when before all the
American glass was as notarized as it is
[SPEAKER_03]: now everybody wanted Roars everybody still
wants Roars and it is a pleasure to share
[SPEAKER_01]: this with you guys awesome dude I'm
excited yeah it's cool to be here and see
[SPEAKER_01]: these days like the fans and yeah all
pieces this is the other side of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: people love it and it's cool to see this
one's an old jar eyes from the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was like he called it being with us
stay there for a week or 10 days and so we
[SPEAKER_01]: combine his design with our technique
let's say what year was this I think I got
[SPEAKER_01]: it in late 2010 2011 something like that
maybe nine eight nine ten I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ever seen this piece before no I it's
it's actually the piece I have beside my
[SPEAKER_01]: bed yeah so I mean you know we can make
like probably 10-15 pieces doing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have I have to I also have a special pool
and then we we did mark my son played with
[SPEAKER_01]: his designs creations and
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it beside my bed there there there
there there were three identical ones to
[SPEAKER_03]: this with the same color patterns and
sections and I got high integrity glass
[SPEAKER_03]: art got two out of the three and I still
have they never they never they kept it
[SPEAKER_03]: they got kept in the collection so treated
kindly oh oh forever and ever and ever and
[SPEAKER_03]: then this one is I don't know what year
this is from I have no idea it's um red
[SPEAKER_03]: man's originally it's I've been around but
also with a beautiful little marble here
[SPEAKER_03]: and the the clear glass imprint on on the
on the tube I just love that yeah that's
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy yeah nice downstem too on that one
yeah beautiful work downstem yeah this is
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure also seven eight yeah maybe nine
years old yeah still going strong still
[SPEAKER_01]: going very strong it's damn nice that
pole's nice if you see the pipes today you
[SPEAKER_01]: see this is already like history years ago
yeah yeah totally is well there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: collectors that have you know I mean a lot
of people hold on to the rules they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't see a lot of them going up for
resale you don't see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to move them yeah I heard many
times so over the years they kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: you get closer with your fights oh yeah
every day very very very much and I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly I school to see yeah we that's
the most reward or one for your work when
[SPEAKER_01]: people love what you do so they're just
not buying it to use it because there are
[SPEAKER_04]: people that buy them to use them then
there are people that are buying them
[SPEAKER_01]: literally to collect them yeah but
especially I mean you know our philosophy
[SPEAKER_01]: or it's like to to fit certain things you
know it's the quality and the design and
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality also about how does the
filtering system and the volume and these
[SPEAKER_01]: all work together yeah so it's all working
machines and when you respect you you
[SPEAKER_01]: learned a little bit you need 88 or 44 for
example so you see what is good for you
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it's working perfect every day
yeah sure enough so that's what is our
[SPEAKER_01]: goal also so like you have your everyday
piece works really good good to clean the
[SPEAKER_01]: daily driver we even do repair services
one day oh really you really would break
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that he said he's already
sitting four times so people laugh oh do
[SPEAKER_01]: we see this give pipe so many times and
it's cool so when they unpack it he
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed it again yeah the one he's
talking about is actually the one of five
[SPEAKER_04]: it was the first time I believe roar had
ever done a collaboration with an American
[SPEAKER_04]: artist that was Mike fro yes and so yeah
that piece I love that piece it's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: real nice and tight and smaller than my
know my other ones that I used to be more
[SPEAKER_04]: into the bigger the chunky yeah 18 eight
and stuff and that got into the 14 for and
[SPEAKER_04]: this one's a really nice thing thin tall
to the really beautiful Mike fro was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first yeah he was the first American to
come over yes and in that time it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: started grow bigger and then they started
to do really beautiful pieces I met him at
[SPEAKER_01]: the exhibition in in Santa Barbara I think
I had an amazing experience with that
[SPEAKER_01]: finally came over and we we did five
pieces and went to the cannabis cup and we
[SPEAKER_01]: were all beautiful and you bought one of
the first I think it was the first that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the one you still have at your house it's
really nice really nice and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's funny when in my holidays Mike Mike
contacted me Mike from today how are you
[SPEAKER_01]: nice everything good should we do
something together what year was that oh
[SPEAKER_01]: three no no no year that it originally I
think I said five oh five
[SPEAKER_04]: the pipe signed that's why I think it's oh
three but maybe oh four it's signed yes
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah even dated I think underneath one of
five and those are the ones yeah yes you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know you've always done that even
for the first piece that you ever gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: this in in Barcelona the guy who told me
he was on our booth and we start talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about my phone so he said this his body
just around the corner oh wow and finally
[SPEAKER_01]: we hooked up I just said that'd be neat to
see him come out again and do another
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboration yeah years later I mean and
if it was oh five do a full decade later
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah even and you could do more than five
but it would be yeah it would just be neat
[SPEAKER_04]: to go back and be like oh let's look at
pictures of the original pieces and go
[SPEAKER_04]: from there there's an idea for you Mike as
you're watching this I have two others
[SPEAKER_03]: that I brought and they are American
collaborations as well and they're very
[SPEAKER_03]: special and also Mark helped make this all
happen too so this is the double jacketed
[SPEAKER_03]: hops in line yeah that's a piece of
history right there that is my wife's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually I gotta make sure I specify on
that she once once she saw that I remember
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting there watching you guys all sign
I'll never forget sitting there watching
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys all sign that zero nine oh nine
yes I guess that was seven years ago why
[SPEAKER_04]: did it seem like so many more no I was
thinking of Mike fro Mike fro was like oh
[SPEAKER_04]: three or four yeah Mike fro was before
yeah way before me can I see that I broke
[SPEAKER_03]: this piece in as you're looking at that
let me take this one out too yeah so that
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys can look at them together hops
the Dizzle and and Sasha big the big Swiss
[SPEAKER_03]: one of my pride and joys
[SPEAKER_04]: these are unbelievable right now to be
holding with you this many years later it
[SPEAKER_03]: is pretty well I so still in the bottom
sorry we gotta clean that one out but this
[SPEAKER_01]: is great yeah I'll never forget it the
cannabis comes somehow same year when they
[SPEAKER_03]: mean dear yeah both oh nine and I believe
there were two or three hops right hop did
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three of them and and Dizzle did
two or three and then one was a Dizzle
[SPEAKER_03]: hops yeah which I whoever has that out
there if you're watching this video hit me
[SPEAKER_03]: up yeah I know I have a picture don't take
it on my face and it's like your eyes line
[SPEAKER_04]: up like right in the two I have a picture
of Nate Dizzle blowing this sick in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany with his big white part whatever
for such yeah shades yeah and he's like
[SPEAKER_04]: holding it up on a tube and it's covering
his head and he's a big guy the perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: size away and it's like he's inside of
this perfectly in the photo it's very cool
[SPEAKER_04]: Nate this was yeah this was historical for
me too just because I was talking to
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin about it earlier before we started
filming that it was just really like I
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to just help make it happen it
wasn't there was no monetary reason for me
[SPEAKER_04]: it wasn't a business venture for me I
wasn't involved in any of the selling of
[SPEAKER_04]: the pieces I bought them off direct offer
yeah I just wanted to get them there and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was quite an adventure to get them
there yeah and I damn near died that trip
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some wicked food poisoning really oh
yeah in Germany or in Holland in
[SPEAKER_04]: Frankenthal yeah I remember I was gone for
a whole day when they were blowing all
[SPEAKER_04]: these pieces and I never got like a whole
day I missed of being there because I had
[SPEAKER_04]: food poisoning right for you dab there
flop sure yeah and Corey cold so we call
[SPEAKER_04]: him back to awesome yeah very cool for you
to bring those pieces I'm sure I brought
[SPEAKER_03]: slides and and I even brought a club a
banger so we can hit them if you guys want
[SPEAKER_03]: seven years they look nice all lined up
together well I still have another seat I
[SPEAKER_03]: still have another four or five that I
left at home because I just don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: enough bags yeah I would've been cool you
know trust me I got nine more bags on I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean we did roll the Amsterdam that one
time with like six or seven oh yeah I've
[SPEAKER_03]: had we've had more
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely I'll get a few shots of you for
sure next up is another session so what do
[SPEAKER_04]: you think of that Martin I think what is
it 88
[SPEAKER_04]: so as someone that's known for precision
you can feel the precision that in that
[SPEAKER_04]: piece in the in the the Opals in the way
they're encased in the glass it's almost
[SPEAKER_04]: oh that's the bowl in the OFC
[SPEAKER_01]: did you see the swing though amazing work
in it great just the swing for now see how
[SPEAKER_04]: that quartz bucket opens and closes and
then that other piece carbs it the same
[SPEAKER_04]: way I was using my vial of hash to carve
the this pipe comes with a slightly more
[SPEAKER_04]: fancy version it's like the most the
world's most expensive OFC and I've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: them sell for like what is OFC optimized
flavor zone so like yeah you know the zone
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows you to take a colder colder dab
which gets you more flavor yeah so you put
[SPEAKER_04]: these on here no the other way though or
is it that way oh yeah yeah it is that way
[SPEAKER_03]: like because the you would you would when
you torch up the tire the or the quartz
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so you can have the actual element at
a lower temperature so that the more of
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor comes through because when it's
at a hotter thing it instead of vaporizing
[SPEAKER_00]: it combusts so basically caps it and it's
still allowing air to go through yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: it's got that little hole right in the
center they're very cool Opals like you
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't believe this one too because it's
the one that Scott basically is the only
[SPEAKER_04]: one who can do and it's his his yeah this
is like all of the designs Martin all of
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know the tourists and the clients
yeah those are the three because this is
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the Taurus right this one's just
the Taurus and then there's the fab egg
[SPEAKER_04]: and then there's the client that piece is
all three of them in one piece yeah it's
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty incredible oh you know what we'll
probably won't matter I'll probably just
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah ten seconds with bubble hash
[SPEAKER_03]: some other flowers and you guys like the
overall amount of bubble hash you'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: getting so you're not losing that you're
not nice you're not losing but with like I
[SPEAKER_03]: know people that are starting to rosin are
really high quality and personally I think
[SPEAKER_03]: we're happy
you you you you you you
