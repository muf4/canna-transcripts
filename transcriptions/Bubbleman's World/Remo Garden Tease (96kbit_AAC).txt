[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am over at Remo, the Urban Growers place
and I'm really excited to be able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: you through this room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's giving me permission, I'm not going
to be posting it right away, but my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just finished a five hour hash church
by the way, with Remo and D420K and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different kind of hash church,
not so much dropping a lot of knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really just hanging out and telling
stories and having a good time and puffing
[SPEAKER_00]: bowls, hitting dabs and what not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I want to take you
guys into this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, did it just go orange on me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just make sure that we've got the
right, when we get in here, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me just show you guys right
off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go manual, we're going to
go into a white balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn that green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we go guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockstar at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that one's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that Girl Scout cookies that he
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's not the Girl Scout cookies
that any of us really recognize,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll tell you, they have stacked in
the dankety nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got that little one in the
background that's probably still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a pound plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this DNA Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let me give you an idea on how big
this plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am six feet tall, standing next to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my arms stretched out as high as I
can, I cannot reach the top of this
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kosher Kush DNA Genetics, representing
strong as always in Ramo's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk through, here we have a really
nice Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could actually be a UBC chemo Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just check.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's Rockstar for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is UBC chemo Kush, or was that over
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's here, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just a pleasure to video any
time, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get into the room and get a little
video of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So impressive, the resin production,
the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of those Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, I don't know the cut,
but it is very frosty, very covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of those in the background
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Kosher almost hitting the
roof of this, I don't know, 10 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure to be able to go and
walk through Ramo, the urban grower's
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all grown with his newest
nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that he's showing people that,
well, his nutrients definitely work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried them myself, but being a
good friend of his, I will definitely give
[SPEAKER_00]: him a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at the resin production of his
plants, that's going to be that UBC chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup, UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strain that Ramo gifted me a
while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really strong, hard hitting Kush,
that musky, cushy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unmistakable, definitely some strong OG
cut, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time he grows it, as you can see,
it just looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to get this big wide
angle lens off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a little closer, like,
without the wide angle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully close.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue on, go hang out
upstairs with D420K and Ramo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might go and have some lunch after
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure, but man, I'll tell you,
it sure is nice to be hanging out in Ramo,
[SPEAKER_00]: the urban grower's garden, as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
Thanks for watching.
