[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is where it gets good,
boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, first I usually have to start by
saying welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're back here at Merlin's, cooking with
Merlin, and I brought another good buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: that you guys may recognize from some of
the Whistler Riding videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pat Tay is in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Patty and I just spent the day with
our families up in Squamish picking more
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms at the same place that Merlin
and I were at last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we brought some of those mushrooms,
but I guess what we're gonna do is have a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of beers and have a couple of
puffs, and then these guys are gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: prepare another meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the meal preparation today?
[SPEAKER_03]: The meal today, we're gonna do some bahn
mi sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegetarian style, just for yourself,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with some coleslaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't bring your herb?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what to... Well,
you wanted to press some, but I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really have time, so... We can do a mini
squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one of those mini... A little
flatter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I got a real mini one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a real mini one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A real mini one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if this works here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying this little hash one-hitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't burn for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, that was melty hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually melted and bubbled a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you do have a little press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure we got a press in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that thing on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: A joint at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosin ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it work okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what?
[SPEAKER_02]: For what it is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For what you get a joiner to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were gonna pull out a flat
iron, I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for a hair crimper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that thing, but the flat version.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always looking for new ways to ingest
and consume hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I not always have something different?
[SPEAKER_02]: You always got something unique,
something that's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: One way to get it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, today I forgot my rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I forgot my entire packed up,
all my dabs, the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch, temp tech, pipe, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I did find was a couple of
these one-hitters and I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: well shit, that's probably enough to sit
back with the boys and have a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: pups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Merle already ruled a nice
duvet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little cannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little cannon, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brixton's raging around with the lamb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful Sunday here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't I give you guys a little show of
the view real quick here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful Lions Bay, B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Japanese maple is red out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually stopped raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it stopped raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, how about Shannon Falls?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I said to Shar, I don't think I've
ever seen Shannon Falls raging that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for those of you that are in and
around the Vancouver area, Shannon Falls
[SPEAKER_02]: is absolutely going off right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be not a bad place to go in the
next few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't climb up and go anywhere near
the actual waterfall, but I would enjoy it
[SPEAKER_02]: from under, you know, the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice shower at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the summer I go in it when
it's like dribbling, but the way it is
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, you wouldn't want to go in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, summers ago, didn't some guys fall
off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some YouTubers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going up there into the top
pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the girl lost control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was sliding over and
then the guy went to jump and grab her and
[SPEAKER_02]: he went over too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's trying to get those views.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some stellar views for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think you'd be enjoying
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the way you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't be enjoying it though in
those last 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those last 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some older school Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting, huh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a lot in common in the sense
that Patti also just loves to cook and
[SPEAKER_02]: make food and he's always just busting out
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what stoners like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask me, they're like, do you cook
for professionals?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, I just smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you eat really good food,
it's hard to go back.
True.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is husky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never noticed that on this bike
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was straight, like, milly husky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they sold it, they said it was the
lone wolf.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lone wolf?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I've got to show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, well, we're talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably should show it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wolf, the lone wolf.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we do some cooking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why don't we clean this up real
quick and get to what's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to do it with, we'll do like
a yogurt dill sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fucking delicious with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed the guys, but literally,
Patty just was saying how he'd never made
[SPEAKER_02]: these types of sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was just like last week,
googling the sauce for these sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, why am I not making banh mi
sandwiches?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you saying, Brickson?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I buying them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't I just make them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you saying, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always better to make it at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always is, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we've got some,
we've got the wild brine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll start with the tofu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kimchi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some garlic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I'll get you set up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to start cutting up some,
for the slaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabbage?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cabbage.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's got to go off in here to prepare
some food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now is there any?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say slice it thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I would do, but you
don't have to, are you particularly going
[SPEAKER_02]: this way or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use an island.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cut you like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm deadly bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, usually I'd quarter it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just slice it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quarter it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit of both, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you be hanging out of the mouth?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I kind of held back and didn't
have a joint in my mouth the whole time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but pretty much I always cook it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer in your hand, smoke in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like a real Québécois.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got, ginger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some ginger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a spoon is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a spoon kills it on instead of the
knife, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting little trick,
eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, instead of like tearing into the
ginger with a knife and losing a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're not losing any.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it just really takes the skin right
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two guys are going for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brush up some garlic after he cuts up the
ginger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just slice the ginger into fairly big
chunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to grind it into the
blender anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much easier to put to build sauces in
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got the slibbity slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to go, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ginger and garlic in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of onion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the bullet is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put some lemon in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, just right there, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, put some lemon in there,
opens this cupboard, pulls out a handheld
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon juicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like two inches away from his hip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, a little soy sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, lemon ponzu.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little ponzu.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of sesame oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sesame oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sriracha.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be Canadian, we'll put some maple
syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, a little maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be Canadian?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, actually, I think I'm going
to go buy a bottle and put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: tahini.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little tahini?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just to emulsify it, kind of,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little tahini.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't see that one coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is looking sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just making a mess, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Frackle coated.
[SPEAKER_02]: A vicious racket with its arms around your
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth about marijuana, degradation,
sin, vice, insanity, debauchery,
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke of hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of you that are wondering
where that came from, it came from here,
[SPEAKER_02]: Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can thank, like, William Randolph
Hearst and those assholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're still responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bolt that up a little bit
and relax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can, but I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the small fruits of our labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a big chanterelle for a yellow
foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, maybe for yourself,
this will be easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow is bigger, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm telling you, there was a lot of
chanterelles out there today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these yellow foots are the winter
chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they call them, the yellow
foots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, once you hit a patch... Do they come
all year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Until, like, December, January,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try picking them all year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a new meal every week for,
like, three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little slice of our tofu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, a little tofu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeeze that water out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to always think it was some sort of
solution, but it's literally just water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Special, special tofu.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was like, what are they
putting in it to make it better?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, it's water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's the tofu solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The tofu solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: In a sense, it is a solution, because
without it, it would dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not the solution you were thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like double entendre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, soy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not the best for you,
but... What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Soy is probably not the best for you,
but it tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're going to eat some today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, it's going in, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, schnapples.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you do it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that nice creaminess from the
tahini, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instantaneously appetizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the beauty of tofu.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really like a nice base element.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big salad from Patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll let that marinade soften up
with a bit of lemon juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You marinate it and you just throw the
tofu right in the marinade?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you're tossing that salad,
is anyone else here thinking about that
[SPEAKER_02]: joke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or am I the only five-year-old in the
room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tossing the salad joke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like the minute he started doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it come to your minds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm like a five-year-old.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are filming, so... I heard you chuckle,
but I just don't think you thought of it
[SPEAKER_02]: before I said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm more twisted than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you said tossing the salad,
they immediately went there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not in prison, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to be anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of today, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, today's the anniversary.
[SPEAKER_02]: October 17th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's the anniversary of legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys like us went from the back rooms to
the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give a thumbs up on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the back to the front.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to shred this too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shave it and shred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shave it and shred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of my speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That man was giving me a little... A
little kimchi?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little kimchi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probiotic, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw gluten-free vegans.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got all the popular terms for
selling food these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think kimchi is one of those hit items
now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always just been super healthy and
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like kale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing kale dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time we should go pick kale at my
buddy's garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got monster fucking dinosaur kale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got the best anchole on the recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to go get those evergreen
huckleberries as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do something with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: The foraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's just expand our ability to
forage and find as many things as we can
[SPEAKER_02]: and then make cool things out of the
things we find.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sea asparagus would be a cool one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking the sea grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sea grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the sea asparagus would kill us too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few broccoli and radish ones
there too, if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to definitely put those
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring them over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we should put some carrot in there
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should grate another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we want some for the sandwiches
too.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of putting it in the
coleslaw though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll brighten it up a bit with the
orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have some fresh cilantro growing
down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually do like cabbage, carrot,
cilantro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do garlic and mayo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of mustard, vinegar,
and salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down, do it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yogurt for the dill sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yogurt for the dill sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mango flavored?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine just pouring in this
super fruity yogurt?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think not.
[SPEAKER_02]: As he puts in a bunch of fruit citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to put citrus in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the dill sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, I'm going to put my secret
ingredient in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can turn the camera off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to have a secret ingredient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not much of a secret, it's just hard
to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight from where?
[SPEAKER_03]: From Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a soup concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sauces and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like vegetable salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good in everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just 98% MSG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possibly organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's like, I know the stuff that he
put in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, they have these too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would love these, Marcus, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's a mushroom one as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only get them once a year in
Germany from this company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pre-order it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Champignon, pastete.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pates are just absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like cat food.
[SPEAKER_03]: But try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once a year, I'll get my grandmother to
send me something from Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that delicious or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: All vegetables, all organic, small drops
from this organic company in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost got a smoky flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's steintilts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steintilts are the king mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: King bolita, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are king bolets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw some beautiful bolets in the forest
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys get any good ones that were
edible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any way to really prepare
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll show a picture of it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are good fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was three and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the way I shot it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutting up more garlic?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would have Tosh and then me and
then the mushroom in front.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have looked like it was three and
a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a present for your kid after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids love presents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bunch of toys so I have to be not
like it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the dill in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's tossing the salad again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's tossing the salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to toss the salad?
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants German salad tossing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already put lemon in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to do the dressing that you
said before, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like fall now.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are crushing it over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got baked dill over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for the...
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for the dill sauce for the banh
mi.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's up, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of pepper.
Salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
We'll do some old school style here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, old school style, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 minutes of preparation so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do it fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this could use some thickening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yogurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to put a bit of mayo.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit of mayo?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll thicken it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like crushing the garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salt just drives it up.
Like so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thickening over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tossing over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoons?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, does that smell good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a nice flavors in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put a little bit of rapeseed oil in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just cilantro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cilantro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll grab the cilantro in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's downstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do the tofu right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tofu's going in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tofu going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go this way after some quick salad
tossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't want to see that get all
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll come over here for Mr.
Joint Smoking Tofu Cooker.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the oil just like preheated over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rapeseed oil for a high heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what kind of heat are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty hot, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or medium high, yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this will all get marinated right
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of sauce now, but it'll all
absorb into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to bring a small plate home for
our wives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was requested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was requested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was requested.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did Charlotte like the noodles last
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: She loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she thought they were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that, Patty?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that's what the videos were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring home the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you have, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Divorce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Divorce.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I always think of my woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love her so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I brought her food home for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: She thinks of me the same way,
so it's reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mutual.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: 32 years I've been with my beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many years?
[SPEAKER_02]: 32.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Married for like 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't buy that at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
No, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should butter them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the buns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Butter the buns.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to be commenting on this
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can't film a video of hanging out
with my buddies and shooting the shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: puffing dupes while you guys have a beer,
and make a video, then I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: live in that world if I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a fun world.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be able to... Have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be able to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually very chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's looking delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I love about tofu,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, all that stuff sucks right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the water disappears, the tofu grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little butter in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, a little burr in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's preheat this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: 400.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just noticed that this stuff is
basically the same color as my sweater.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a sauce to match my sweater.
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Matches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to SETI for the psychedelic
research hoodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving them the turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like perfectly French
toasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do look like French toasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little French toasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you told someone this was French toast,
and then put syrup on it, they'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just tell them, no, the syrup's
already in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no maple syrup in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Infused like McDonald's nebretta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that means, but... Yeah,
well, is that what it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your butter in the bonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're doing this, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so that it crisps up and gets nice
and golden brown when we put it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's the key, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll remember these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Butter makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go through ridiculous amount of butter
on a weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting it on the inside, the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I'll be boiling this in
butter, then frying them in butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could poach the tofu in butter next
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you want on a bun meal,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice crisp crunch when you're biting
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just ridiculous with this kind
of... Smells so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice tofu meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't mess around with good tofu.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a lot of bad tofu out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really like soft tofu as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like plain tofu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soft tofu is really weird, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like solid pudding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to get that stuff crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of turned into scrambled rung
meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I need my beverage,
because these guys are sipping their
[SPEAKER_02]: beverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they're drinking beers,
I am drinking water, even though it looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was vodka, and I did this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that the trailer park boys trick
with the dad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Lee.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of not vodka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel the shit fling to the air,
Randy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the trailer park boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: RIP, Mr. Leahy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him with... Who was he with?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was with Randy, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Whistler?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was in Vancouver at a health event.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a health event?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Randy was walking around without his
shirt, and he was like, he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need a cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I found out later it was my
friend, Mark, who actually had brought
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some cannabis cup that he was
doing, and he brought Snoop Dogg one year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he brought Charlie Murphy one year.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Charlie Murphy came and did a comedy
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, come see Charlie Murphy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come see Charlie Murphy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't think I'm going to be
able to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, if you can get here for like
1130, I got a surprise for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get there, me and Shar end up going
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like on Hastings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the bamboo room or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're in the back little green room or
whatever, and we're sitting at a table and
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear everyone clapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're backstage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he comes out with his bodyguard,
Charlie Murphy with his bodyguard,
[SPEAKER_02]: and sits at our table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the next hour and a half,
we proceed to tell like true life Charlie
[SPEAKER_02]: Murphy stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to tell him some of my own crazy
life stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the greatest experience,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to shout out Mark for that because
that was it really was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace to Charlie Murphy as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some good tonguing you got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tongue ninja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little grilled ginger for the side.
Can't say no to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buns in the oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: From yesterday for his finishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was from the marathon that he did
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came in 10th place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels sweaty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to hear the funniest part of
the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: He finishes the 50k marathon in the rain
like dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finishes the race like yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my car keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he lost them in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had to walk home.
[SPEAKER_03]: He calls me panicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Oh, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost them in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently somehow speaks to someone from
the town.
[SPEAKER_03]: They find his keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tells me he's like, you know,
I got to tell you I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like finding my keys felt better than
winning the 50k.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine you're soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just finished 50k.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get in your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can barely stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just a brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've heated this oven up already till
about three 50 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three 75 there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three 75.
[SPEAKER_03]: Few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of what else we need
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the carrots, the tofu.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting this down on the table over
there or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should make the table and get
some of this over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some shit's gotta be convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's starting to look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got three minutes on this battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're cutting up the Avi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to dress everything
once he's got it all set up right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the sauce, the kimchi.
[SPEAKER_02]: The carrots, the tofu, gingered up the
salad and a variety of sprouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your sprouts, Patty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are broccoli and radish microgreens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little, uh, you want them for the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to dice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you, I think we should put them in
the sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So small pieces or big pieces?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you, dude, always like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, man, you just, you just,
I love you, but you just fucked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Brixton.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pulling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's from Quebec.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to tell him how to smoke
cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll figure it out no matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be on a fucking pin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be on the cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be literally any formation or
fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Quebec, a traditional fashion when you
learn how to smoke cash is the old hot
[SPEAKER_03]: knife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can take like 25 years ago and use it on
the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the hole or the flipped knife,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The double two knives on there and you,
you grab it and then push them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot knives.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, we did everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually really good hash that I
put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't, I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's bubbling and melting.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like, you can't actually put malty
hash in a one hitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember when I had the ball with
finger hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought it up the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was kind of funny and I
was being kind of silly and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were feeding the whiskey jacks and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him a little morsel of food on top
of the hash ball and didn't really think
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He flew off, but I just, I didn't think
about it at the time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But later on in the day and I'm like,
man, that poor little fucker is either
[SPEAKER_02]: having the best time of his life or he's
sleeping it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt kind of shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whiskey jacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take it off you man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the coolest little birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let them steal your dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a quarter pound finger hash
ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put some of this on here so that it
doesn't turn brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now let's assemble these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's assemble them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to grab those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say it really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're plating now, are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we got to like be styley.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a VonB so it's not a super styling,
but I think it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you've elevated it a little
bit between the two of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be pretty colorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this zone right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I ate a small bowl of chowder
before I came, so I wouldn't be starving
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get like starving when you put
the tofu into the pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when my mouth started watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now my stomach's actually like,
like, okay guys, like how long is this
[SPEAKER_02]: going to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a few friends for dinner last night
and they told me one they see my house,
[SPEAKER_03]: they get hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple of nice shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to make sure the whole zone
here.
Oh
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice green sauce, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just suck up on one side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to get too soggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, damn, how many, you can put
three on there.
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three is three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good with a three.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wash the hands off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next we'll hit it with some of the
carrots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he's putting carrots on your
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to put some carrots on your
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love carrots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The carrots, shredded carrots are so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of the cucumber.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be a massive sandwich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you guys know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think with your eyes, not with your
stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow these fatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cabin it's pretty cold and I had them
in the greenhouse and they took over the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse and then a lot of them,
it froze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't, uh, a lot of them weren't
ripening on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got some green tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I actually took a bunch of off and I
round paper bag them and then they started
[SPEAKER_02]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hit some kimchi on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's still got avocados.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm worried about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like, a little bit of kimchi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like ridiculous at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty, you'll see with the kimchi,
it gives it a nice sour, fermented taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just dosing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to do a cooking series,
we might as well make some outlandish
[SPEAKER_03]: food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like healthy outlandish food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything we've done so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inspiring people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how bubble man eats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got inspired last night with the sage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like a late night pasta and I'm
like, man, I'm doing some brown butter and
[SPEAKER_02]: some sage in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sage butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: After watching the video or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cause I had sage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had sage on hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of avocado in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a little bit of anything on
any of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only a lot of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He starts rocking four tofu's on each.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's get some of those micro greens
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really quite something.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are from your garden too,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow this.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a little micro greens business on the
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing tastes better than from the
garden, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's hit it with the dill leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go to my friend's place for
a quick sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them open so we can put them on the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: All nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to keep them open?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep them open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to photograph them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the other light, this is poor light
over here.
