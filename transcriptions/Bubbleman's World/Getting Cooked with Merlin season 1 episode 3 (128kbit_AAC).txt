[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am back with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: As usual, some good food, some good dabs,
and some good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start off by rolling some joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a couple of big nuggets there,
hey?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to show the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know what's going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little fatty Kush nugget.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people don't know what
gas is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some people smell sativas and
terpenaline, and they call it gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ain't gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasoline is Kush smoked knock you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that smell right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the definition of gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it literally has a gas smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did bring my banger here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a buddy that's going to be showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another friend of mine, actually,
who's also very good friends with Patty,
[SPEAKER_02]: who you guys met last week on Cooking with
Merlin, when they produced those
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous fucking bami sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were so good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to make them again this week,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: My girl was asking me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patty and Mike, who's going to be coming
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Mike's going to want to be
on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect he probably won't care,
and he will join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of neat, you know,
doing these Cooking with Merlin shows and
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing in a new individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merlin's going to bring some guests in
eventually as well here in the next couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of weeks that we'll be able to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess in the meantime, we will get
stoned, yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I using the German accent?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're going to be cooking a German
specialty today.
[SPEAKER_04]: K채se Sp채tzle, otherwise known as mac and
cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a little bit fancied up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old-timey dish I've been having
since I'm a little kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like from mom and grandma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like all I wanted from when I was
a kid when grandma came to come see us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was make K채se Sp채tzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love the aspect of food,
how it connects generations, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got grandma's recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to do grandma's recipe or a
recipe similar to it, something that
[SPEAKER_02]: Merlin's got a history with, it just makes
it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that much more cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Connects it with a memory too,
which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's almost nothing else that can do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a certain smell or taste that
connects you to a memory of yours is
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you light that kush joint, I'm like
flooding with kush memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to hit the Ewok glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many years since you smoked a joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I usually say about 20, but then
there's always people, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you light a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone did come up to me like four years
ago with the Karma Cup and they had a
[SPEAKER_02]: Kanagar and they were like, Oh,
would you mind, you know, lighting this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like an honor thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was mostly, it was tons of
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 80% hash, but then it was
wrapped in some leaves and there might've
[SPEAKER_02]: been some weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll light it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lit it, passed it on, didn't really
smoke it, you know, and now people are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you smoked a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, I lit the Kanagar,
but the last time I smoked, a joint for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure was 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tricked people on the last one too,
with that hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked totally like a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause some guy from Humboldt was like,
that's not a unique one hitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been smoking out of those for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but not like paper ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The glass ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The glass and the ceramic and they conduct
heat and they're just very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be as convenient and
ease of use as, you know, being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like the problem is the glass
ones, unfortunately, because of like other
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs that made it, they look bad,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You pull out a glass pipe like that,
people are thinking you're not smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like those paper ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks more like a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like when I'm drinking my
water and everyone thinks I'm drinking
[SPEAKER_02]: vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about that off camera
before, but I'm sure you guys have seen my
[SPEAKER_02]: memo bottles, these very flat bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that looks the least like
an alcohol container, yet it still does
[SPEAKER_02]: have a little bit, what kind of vodka you
got there today?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I got the H2O vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Siroc version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Siroc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Berry flavored.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the dabber or did you put that
away already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, super excited with these series.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys seem to be very receiving them
very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a positive, yeah,
positive comments and positive feedback
[SPEAKER_02]: from everyone that's been watching the
Cooking with Merlin series.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's close.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to try and keep pumping
these out.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the weekly, on the Sundays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a few of you have said,
oh, it would be great if he used measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not how we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to follow the recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to throw stuff in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe what we could do is add the recipes
at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like the idea, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do love the fact that you don't
measure things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also try today, because my
girlfriend's brand, Relax, we'll have some
[SPEAKER_04]: of these edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all dried banana chips infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two and a half milligrams a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very unique and novel product that you can
find here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the only edible that's a fruit
that I know of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only edible with natural fats
found in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delicious to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: No cannabis flavor whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: None.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just done with straight distillers,
although there is none.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the bioavailability is really there
because of the natural fats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really helps, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: R-I-L-A-X-E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold across Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool little idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's got like apricots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mangoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mangoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All good fruit, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get ourselves dabbed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I'm going to hit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to go for a little
strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Merlin also went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picking the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went and picked a ton of chanterelles
at the spot that we were at the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're probably going to incorporate the
chanterelles, we meaning him, into the mac
[SPEAKER_02]: and cheese or into the.
[SPEAKER_02]: K-spez-le.
[SPEAKER_02]: K-spez-le.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheese-spez-le, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried my best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Kase?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kase.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always called it Kass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spelled K-A-A-S.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure people are going to call me out
on my misspelling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I speak schwebisch German.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it spelled K-A-A-S?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I'm not a total vegetarian,
but I'm close to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm in Germany, you can imagine
I'm eating a fair amount of Kass or Kase.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got nothing else to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like meat sticks and sticks of meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more cheese and meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_04]: And potatoes and sour cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potatoes and cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been going there, I've probably done
10, 20 trips to Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably right along at 10 to 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started going to Dortmund originally in
the late 90s for the Kenna business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would go to that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I became really good friends with
Martin from Ruhr.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's in Franken Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really like little, like one of those
neighborhoods where you really like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not in a big city.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the streets are like without GPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get locked into dead ends like
every single.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a maze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not designed for like Mercedes
500 SLs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my cousin actually lives in this little
town called Biberach, which is your
[SPEAKER_04]: classic tiny little German town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been, he's been in the packaging
business for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do most of the food packaging across,
across Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just recently, he was a super
conservative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked my mom about cannabis
packaging since then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we do pretty much all day
is I make sure that I can bring products
[SPEAKER_04]: like yours to market as cheap as possible
with good packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if we've mentioned it
before, but Merlin works with CanMart,
[SPEAKER_02]: formerly Namaste Technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of been a, I've been involved
since he kind of went over there and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: grown himself into a nice, strong
position.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you know, my company Embark
and CanMart have recently kind of created
[SPEAKER_02]: a little synergy and we'll, we'll tell you
more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future as we announce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really fun when we get to work
together as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's even more fun, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some good hash products.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, that's what's really
lacking in the Canadian market right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is like good products.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't understand what good products
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just listening to what other
people are saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and let's get into the real
conversation because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know the very people who are,
you know, basically mocking and belittling
[SPEAKER_02]: the Canadian regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I can understand where they're
coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's difficult and it's,
it gets to me sometimes, but trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring great products to market in a
regulated environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's almost like we're rewinding
and starting back over with like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, now all of these new people who
have, you know, and I think the thing
[SPEAKER_02]: about cannabis is that it was so removed
from everything for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that group of people, as much as
they may have thought they wanted it open
[SPEAKER_02]: for everyone, I think they're having a
hard time with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh, who the fuck is this
guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does he think he is?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he's everyone, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we wanted cannabis to be for
everyone, not locked in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I think about this micro
program is gate is, but the problem is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that those very regulations we talk
about are holding back these micros.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at anyone's business plan,
let's do a micro based on the square
[SPEAKER_04]: footage and the amount of investment,
especially here in BC, you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_04]: four to five year runway before you start
seeing a penny that you have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: complete passion and have bank in the,
in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put the right steps in place,
I think with farm gate and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they're missing is that the
regulations for these small guys just
[SPEAKER_04]: don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the bankroll to lose the
money to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make much sense for even some
of the medium and bigger players.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the regulations against your company,
against my company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just crushing small companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's protect the most vulnerable
players, but there's a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of the board who really need
protecting too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just as likely to get eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reason that I say that the small
fight for the small guys is cause the big
[SPEAKER_04]: guys have such big rooms that they can't
show enough love to their cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: grow good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the products that you and me want
to see in market, it takes the smaller guy
[SPEAKER_04]: that's this is his life.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he doesn't have this crop come through
as nice as possible, he's not going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to keep surviving.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't be growing bad cannabis on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have people like, there are
people like that know how to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that are involved with these companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these companies have, you know,
like, I mean, DNA was involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't canopy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because growing herb that good on that
level is so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big difference between 20 lights
and 400.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably should have been grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pragmatically small, like everyone starts
out as a micro and the ones that gain
[SPEAKER_02]: milestones and success can apply and
become maybe bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pretend to know the cure for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think no matter what you suggest,
someone would have a big fucking problem
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like they always do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just try to navigate it the best
that I can from a hash makers perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good in, good out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be the recipe for good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But trying to find great material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the first material we found,
like it was maybe our second or third
[SPEAKER_02]: batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shit was like, it came back like
81%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tested all the microns, the 25 micron
that people are like, oh, that's just food
[SPEAKER_02]: grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the question is, did the supplier have
you have another batch for you the next
[SPEAKER_04]: time?
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't really the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not in this instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was regulations that have has
kept and still is keeping that hash from
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, uh, we told it, but it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been over a year and it's still not
released.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would say it's at least a five star
bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I remember seeing pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was purple in the picture that you
took.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chopped cookies is definitely in my like,
I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love cushions, but if I wanted to taste
something fruity, I love chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes like smoking oranges.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the concentrates, it's even,
it's like the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Calio, you know, the first
real orange flavored cannabis for me was
[SPEAKER_02]: Calio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I saw Calio, everything sends
tangerine and what, any orangey flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of my first Calio G.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that Calio in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were big, fluffy orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nicest grow I've ever been in,
in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It belonged to Shanti Baba, Scott Blakey,
and it was in Switzerland in Bellinzona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it probably would have been like 2000
or 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I drove down to Bellinzona with bushy
older grower and gypsy Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we drove down to Bellinzona and we met
Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he walked us through a greenhouse of
six foot tall, one or two days away from
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing Calio for like an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a huge greenhouse or a half an
acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really big for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, nicest smell that I had ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was neat that I got to share that
with a bushy older grower and a gypsy
[SPEAKER_02]: Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I asked him, I said, how did you
do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who's growing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, rose farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hire smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I don't hire people from the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rose, rose farmers, rose farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, they are like disciplined,
meticulous, aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was their first crop of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, the only difference was
instead of getting poked, don't get the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only real thing they had to
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, it was just like botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn about the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think what happened to in the
licensed producer world is that it was how
[SPEAKER_04]: many grams can you produce per square
foot?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was your evaluation in the public
markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just ruined everything instead of
how much quality can you pull out a square
[SPEAKER_04]: foot, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of these guys, what did they say?
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw an article the other day,
18% of total cannabis grown since
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization has been sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means there's a ridiculous amount of
crap that's being written down,
[SPEAKER_04]: destroyed or used for God knows what.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those horrible tasting pre-rolls that some
people taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be a, like a, you know,
a facility that's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not for profit, but that takes all of that
and just processes it into cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_02]: just ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then not, they affect the market,
but just like allow whoever has the best
[SPEAKER_02]: overview, probably the government,
Health Canada, to figure out where this
[SPEAKER_02]: should go, but not ever allow it to be
destroyed because it's too high of a
[SPEAKER_02]: value.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think what happens is for
companies, it's probably ends up being
[SPEAKER_04]: cheaper to destroy it than right down to
the loss of profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you should be able to like,
instead of destroying, you should be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to choose to donate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it gets donated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wouldn't it be amazing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just be like, I don't know,
like if you're worried, like make it free
[SPEAKER_02]: to people who don't have access to it at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like homeless people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it for the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make it like, if you don't want to
profit off of it and you're making
[SPEAKER_02]: companies destroy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The destruction should go to Health Canada
labs to make it for free medicine for the
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let someone benefit for God's sakes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went a little bit deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about maybe doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it's time to make some,
uh, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kitchen bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, introduce our next friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the first step is to add onions
to a hot pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty red underneath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to have to caramelize
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheese in the pasta and the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a, we're going to go through
that cheese for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's like four or five different
ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a little salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, don't sweat the onions, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys always sweat the onions.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they're white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they deserve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon to be caramelized and delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's our cheese collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Fontina.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Carlsberg, aged Parmesan, truffle
Gouda and some Gruyere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some cheese, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're lazy, use the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week we were here with Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, he was cooking with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turning into a cooking channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the cheeses at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as much as we can fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes it easier, faster on high.
[SPEAKER_03]: This motherfucker doesn't really mess
around with cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: No fair warning or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like fully homogenized five different
cheeses.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go for the pasta next.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two cups of flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you reckon I should stir this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, you want to let them just sweat a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stir it in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: That first, you know, especially with a
cast iron, that first like caramelization
[SPEAKER_04]: that gets made on the pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you let it sit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So four eggs in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to add in a half a cup of
milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use a vegetable based milk too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted to do this, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can maybe use linseed, linseed water
to replace the egg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever tried that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the vegan egg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and stir it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it into the two cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a little well in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can start mixing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand made pasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, these are really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really different from most pastas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a special German pasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're super light and airy and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it's a special machine you can
get to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm intrigued.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll add in here now a little bit
of salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real secret to this pasta to get a lot
of flavor is nutmeg.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the touch right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple little scrapes in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little nutmeg.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want this dough to be a little bit
runny actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's not runny enough, would you
mind grabbing me some milk out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: fridge?
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be in the door right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just add like another dash of milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it a little moist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a dash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you'll see when it has to go
through the pasta machine, you almost want
[SPEAKER_04]: it like a wet, wet dough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's a very old statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how long have people been saying just
a dash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been replaced by just a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the 2021 version.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do our dabs before our dashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the order.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dash of a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of similarities here with
hash making actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The preparation, the SOP, the awareness
and the cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pasta is done and mixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to let that rest for like
15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10, 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add some butter in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, butter makes everything more
delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: These onions are a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to go too hot and you want
to get them all nice and caramelized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like the sound and the look of
things cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ASMR aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ASMR of cooking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Burger King just do one for the
sizzle with ASMR?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they started doing that a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had cables since 1988.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were definitely doing it in
commercials before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those sounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know what one of the greatest
sounds would be is the dab bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do an ASMR of just the dab bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sucking of the bone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll turn our heat on for this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the contraption, believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we're making pasta with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's fry some mushrooms to put on top of
this as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to fry some mushrooms,
Brixton?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty smelling my dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this pan done.
[SPEAKER_04]: The key to your mushroom cooking is
butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mushroom cooking butter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to cook it with butter and then you
can put a little grapeseed oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes for higher heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Sean was saying you'll get a lot
more mushroom flavor if you don't fry it
[SPEAKER_02]: with garlic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garlic overpowers the mushroom flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Garlic is so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the mix of them both is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take it that way, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a neat way to say if you
wanted to prepare a dish to have a more
[SPEAKER_02]: earthy fungus based flavor, you could do
it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, actually?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to cancel this one right here
and we're going to cook the mushrooms in
[SPEAKER_04]: this pan to get the flavor of the onions
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you spoke like that, I think that's a
great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the garlic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit of extra garlic in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the butter, the onions smell so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you walked into it, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: He had me a gruyere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The truffle gouda is the one that smells
the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smell this cheese, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can smell the truffle right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the water going there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to want to put some salt in
the water too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Salt that shit like the sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salt that shit like the sea, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Onions are pretty much ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put them in the bowl?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's just put them off to the side
for right now while we cook the noodles
[SPEAKER_04]: because we want everything hot at once so
it melts all the cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you were saying, with all the flavor
that we have left in this pan from the
[SPEAKER_04]: onions, we'll cook our chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of onion in there,
get them fried up a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just went in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these beautiful chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to see the chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a yellow, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a yellow flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: A giant yellow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want them to move too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the song.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm just going to add these on the
side just because they're so amazingly
[SPEAKER_04]: flavored.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do them with whiskey this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: Super good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of gin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of gin, we love doing whiskey.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a little bit of...
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do tamari and whiskey.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's his whiskey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black label.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting the water out of these
mushrooms and onions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it's coming from the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I should do?
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do the salad first because we're
going to have time once the noodles are
[SPEAKER_04]: ready, we've got to put everything
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start with the salad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you want to go in the drawer right
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Second one down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a cheese grater.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of cucumber on there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cute.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little cucumber on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite bit of carrot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Condom, you know, salad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff, salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And carrots in salads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's going to make a quick salad
dressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want to give these a stir?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike actually knows how to handle a
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone will be like, why did the camera
get so much better on the Bubble Man than
[SPEAKER_03]: on the camera?
[SPEAKER_03]: This Bubble Man sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: These look great, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want them to spread out again evenly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dressing up of the salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some white balsamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some classic balsamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the secret to every Canadian's
pastry is maple syrup, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't want maple syrup?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some of Sean's great syrup he gave
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had pancakes today and he used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of maple syrup is good in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really cuts the acid, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like when it's too acidic,
a salad dressing, but a bunch of maple
[SPEAKER_04]: syrup or any really sugar will make it a
lot softer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It balances the acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a little bit of Dijon mustard or
a nice amount as an emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be our salad dressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stir our mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the whiskey portion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're nice and fried.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll put a little bit of that in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of the tamari for the
saltiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see there's a whole bunch of
flavor left on the bottom of that pan from
[SPEAKER_04]: the onions.
[SPEAKER_04]: From this, you smell that tamari.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it boil a sec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Puts a nice little crisp on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for the faint of heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it a few times before you eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it with a high ceiling if you're going
to do it anywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not condoning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a one-time, one-try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that puts a nice caramelization on
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now our water is boiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making pasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one last spin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the consistency in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is nice and runny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make sure that there's no
lumps and that the gluten is really
[SPEAKER_04]: binded.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see now that the gluten's binded
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you want to wait and let it
rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you put extra gluten in there for me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra gluten just for you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's switch places here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going to scoop a bunch in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we slap this on top of here so that
it's nice and straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is where it gets kind of crazy
because it's boiling water and the pasta's
[SPEAKER_04]: cooking while you're putting it in,
but we'll do our best on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Manual madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, it's very, very sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks very sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you kind of want to just get that in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you mind sliding those mushrooms
off?
[SPEAKER_04]: Slide it off the heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slide it up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we get in there, this is where
you want to start sliding this thing back
[SPEAKER_04]: and forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can see in the pot,
look at those nice noodles being made,
[SPEAKER_04]: filled with air.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're super fluffy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now we load in some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems... Hey, Mike, while I'm
doing this, would you be able to grab this
[SPEAKER_04]: and put those mushrooms in there so we
don't overcook them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they go in and then they form with
bubbles in them, so they're all fluffy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're hollow on the inside,
like a macaroni almost, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like they're hollow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very, very fluffy because it's an
egg noodle, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that last bit of dough always
gives you a hard time to do the best you
[SPEAKER_04]: can, get it all off there, not at the
expense of wasting your other noodles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you don't want them overcooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But look how beautiful those things are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are some nice noodles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually really long this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're usually shorter than this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a stellar job here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like actual pasta noodles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually they come out a little bit
shorter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the wee, Marlin, but... We
did it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like maestroed that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like some mastery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is Jean-Luc in the French
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are pretty much cooked because
noodles don't take long, especially fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a little strainer here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure everything's good there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One last stir.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Kim is always in crazy meals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strain all that out in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn off your heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I know a lot of people like to run
it with cold water to kind of get those
[SPEAKER_04]: starches out, but you want to keep as much
heat as possible because that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be essential to make it melt all your
cheeses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next stage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quick, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super easy pasta to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we get our nice pot here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get our pasta in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get our onions in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all that butter and onion
deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the best mac and
cheese you guys have ever had.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was coming over for mac and cheese,
I heard, and then this happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to mix in those onions,
get all that flavor and butter distributed
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking a couple of clips just so I can
show you my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's some delicious onion noodles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we start with the cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can smell right away the turps of
those cheeses coming off, especially that
[SPEAKER_04]: truffle cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheese turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheese turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the first turps when people
started fermenting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more cheesy, but you got to get
that cheesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just over the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put another cup of this in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one was that last one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mozzarella.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to have the stringy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're going to, should we mix
that in?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we will.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way you just did that with everything
was like, let's get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make this next level spetzle for the
bubble, for bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mushroom spetzle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mushroom spetzle just for bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, but you handpicked the mushrooms for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hand made the noodles for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's all done special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the cheesy goodness in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at it just get like goopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's going to melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you want it to keep the heat straight
out is because this next few minutes turns
[SPEAKER_04]: it into a sauce kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit it up with a bunch of pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pepper is delicious in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have our own food network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bunch of salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna go gluttonous, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're well on our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we pass gluttonous like three
milestones back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at all that string cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half a pound of curd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half a pound of cheese back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We passed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to do some of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of chopped parsley for the
top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we'll grab some tongs here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's mix our salad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dressing we made earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tongs are the best for salad.
[SPEAKER_04]: All sorts of different seeds in salad is
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get you out of the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was quite a production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's going to be pretty damn
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great Sunday tradition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you should start us off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's look at how cheesy this is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spilt myself off with a little salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving me that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say start yourself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't want the top hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're just going to go back for
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to be crushing some
circus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my mouth is just watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always Merlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us take the first few bites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know what we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give us his
[SPEAKER_00]: The mushrooms added to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude the onions, the mushrooms.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutmeg, those noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The five cheeses that you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had mac and cheese like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's elevated in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd expect them to be a little more
subdued.
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture of the mushroom is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The noodles are very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes so fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely creates that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anyone even pass over
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight into the boiling water as you
shred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can honestly say I've never seen that
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spetzle maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spetzle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spetzle noodles.

[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had mac and cheese like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The onions are just perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: How they're caramelized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been having this dish from my grandma
since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put the recipe in the bottom of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start putting the recipe in the
bottom because Merlin's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring anything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just does it by feel and what not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us while we eat the
Spetzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a Spetzle location.
