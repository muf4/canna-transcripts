[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are heading to Westmoreland today.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're up bright and early because of it's
summer time.
[SPEAKER_10]: The heat is pretty good here in Jamaica
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be heading to see some
fields today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fields, I don't know, one, two,
half.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys looking forward to seeing some
fields?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is definitely what we're looking to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some fresh frozen field runs.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the 20 gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got our micro planer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking forward to seeing what we
can find today on the stick.
[SPEAKER_10]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs that you want with every
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got many different kinds of herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do your research and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs that you want with every
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relief depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat breathing disorders like asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strengthen the body's immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produce longevity and long life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the herbs for more than one
reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we just got to Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just drove over the border from St.
Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_10]: So St. Elizabeth Parish borders with
Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Westmoreland is, of course,
famous in Jamaica for its ganja.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard it in many a reggae songs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the best scents comes from West.
[SPEAKER_10]: Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs for more than one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the herbs to maintain my focus.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We made it to the hills in Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny's got the blueberry skunk that he's
taken a big sniff of.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would say it's definitely A grade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really nice and covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had the microscope out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Intact glandular trichome heads,
which is a rare thing in this heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: They tend to melt.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we figured we'd smoke a little bit of
this hash while we're here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we go visit the ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you ready for a little bowl or what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm ready for some great stuff here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we came for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is 73, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hit the 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we planed up last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the letter, Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually... You just have the letter?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was blue.
[SPEAKER_10]: I threw it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe in your pocket or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is under your phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the old phone, which is turned on
and it's on your camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might drain your battery, but just
letting you know, because I know you like
[SPEAKER_10]: to take pictures with your phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take a picture of this weed
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go first?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Foam out bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Foam out bubble.
[SPEAKER_10]: My first picture of Jamaican grown
resolution.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll look a lot nicer if you take it in
the sun when we're done with this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, it's great to be back in
Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely the proper vibes up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great to first be in Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess both of you guys,
this is your first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: We drove from Kingston.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took us about two and a half hours from
Kingston, driving through to Clarendon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to reload you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of like, I need a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, just wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the beginning of awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to realize we're
going to be seeing a lot of Yamon.
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be hearing a lot of it,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be hearing a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very popular quote here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody says it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thanks for the nice rep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rocking the Hitman, 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's about 32 degrees in the shade,
or as Third World would say, 98 degrees in
[SPEAKER_10]: the shade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Classic song.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yamon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I'm definitely ready for one
of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and there's that little way of
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get that beeline for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice to have the little travel Hitman.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we're definitely not rocking the
mothership in the D-Nail up here right
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't see the power lines.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Light it, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's going to be good getting out
into the field.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all very hot, I would say.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be photographing the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be stuck under the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely be taking breaks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent shade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we got the 50 sun block.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: All that does is potentially protect your
skin from burning.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't protect you from sunstroke.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't protect you from... No,
it really won't.
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, that's the staying out of the sun
is key.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you get in there too much and you're
not used to the heat, especially here in
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica in the summer, man, it can be
devastating.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd be dying for that hit, haven't you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we hit that one little hit on the
way here, which was nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess we're going to continue to
puff a few bowls here, and we're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: make our way up to the field.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll bring you guys along when we get
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go chase some Rebels.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, Bubba Man here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just been hiking up the mountain here for
about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not too long of a hike by any means,
but it's definitely got a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_10]: grade to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heading up into the hills to see a grower
friend's crop here in Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Says it's pretty much ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: He tells us he grows about 400 pounds in
this field.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if that's per year.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's pumping out a hundred pounds four
times a year or what, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess when we get up there, first sign
of water, it's extremely dry season in
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said the plants haven't been watered
for a few days and they're absolutely
[SPEAKER_10]: leaking resin, just dripping.
[SPEAKER_10]: He showed me a couple of buds on the way
in classic pineapple skunk, sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: blueberry skunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very popular names.
[SPEAKER_10]: I recognize the smell from my friend
Geronimo, the doctor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't wait to get up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wicked hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is June, almost 30th.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got a very warm weather,
30 plus degrees every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a hot sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you a real hot sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plantains.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sizzling them up on the fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Real way to make food right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so here we are in the hills,
about to go and explore one of these ganja
[SPEAKER_10]: fields.
[SPEAKER_10]: So come check it out with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really stinky.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a finger.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just touch it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just touch it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I'm covered in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just accidentally touched one.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, you plant nice amount of herbs here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of tree is that?
Huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: The tall one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of tree is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: What strain, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, which one?
[SPEAKER_09]: The tall, tall, tall one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, careful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be knocking over plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a nice tall one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely has some sativa in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, we should buy that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice plant, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just feel my skin burning right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you touch it, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my finger.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, look here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just touched it, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: You see it out there?
[SPEAKER_07]: You see it out there, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a sticky finger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll be there just four,
just eight weeks now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight weeks?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got some nice purpling effect here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's full of purple out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, purple, purple, purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's full of purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one has some pink hairs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've made it here to the beautiful
ganja field in Westmoreland, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't say that I could ever be
happier.
[SPEAKER_10]: The smell is absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was beautiful 500 feet before we even
approached the garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really nicely dense.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got, you know, you've got plants
that are one and two feet tall,
[SPEAKER_10]: many three and four feet tall,
and a few five and six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that one down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even this little guy, look at these
foxtails on this guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell you, that sungrown resin really
reeks, just produces terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I hear a lot of people with the
terp, you know, terp rich, terpy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this right here is extremely terpy.
[SPEAKER_10]: The wonderful thing about this is we're
able to buy whole plants and run them
[SPEAKER_10]: through the bubble banks.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another one over here I wanted to
show you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really big tall guy here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one's over six feet tall,
taller than me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a very different smell to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_11]: This place is crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're happy, man?
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little held up over there with
some killer purple strings.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's some purple right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come see that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come see that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, come see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sticky.
[SPEAKER_08]: The piece of it is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's good to bring the water in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And taste the resin on the end of the
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make your mouth numb a little.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you saying, Ash?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're digging this?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your first time in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been here for what, 48 hours?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in a ganja field.
[SPEAKER_02]: A real ganja field, not like... Look at
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, ah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to wash that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, there's a couple I want to wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, we got to wash that one?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the seven footers back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these ones over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sweating with joy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's this
[SPEAKER_10]: for a little mutant I just found?
[SPEAKER_10]: This thing has crazy dark, almost black
buds on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might want to wash this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get such unique herbs here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: The gene pool is incredible because all
the heads from all over the world have
[SPEAKER_10]: brought their genetics here to share with
the locals.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, the locals have been
breeding cannabis for decades by using the
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds and the strains that they have
access to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: All single leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check out that mutant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Single leaves, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All it is growing is calyx.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, it's always nice to see
real cannabis plants, a real height.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, whoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's also beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got the big one.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that for a queen?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cannabis, John.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm just loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you have the same camera,
too, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about appreciating that, hey?
[SPEAKER_10]: Give thanks for the cloud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that nice, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one looks very Afghani.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big beast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right next to it, we have a very different
style plant with a single cola and a very
[SPEAKER_10]: light fan leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is some more Afghanica over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see the features of the big,
large Indica-style leaves drooping in the
[SPEAKER_10]: hot sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should have tags, John.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be tagging plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are millions of trichomes in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: You happy, dude?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, you're in a Jamaican field.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just say John's happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something very happy about him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here's some beautiful fall colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get some nice purpling effects.
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite a different look to this plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks Soma-esque.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got some really nice pink hairs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: What?
[SPEAKER_09]: This field?
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at this one now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just found something that I wanted to
share with you guys here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the leaf structure on this guy
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see the difference in the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see the thin little leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now this here, this here is a sativa.
[SPEAKER_10]: This here is a sativa.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaican-grown, tropical sun-grown resin
here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could explain to you guys how
unbelievable the smell of this ganja field
[SPEAKER_10]: is.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is no joke.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a wonderful, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love the fact that Jamaica has
decriminalized cannabis for up to two
[SPEAKER_10]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not get any jail or any court.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a ticketable offense, in fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the start of a great thing here
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to the day when a field
like this can be 100% legal, extracted,
[SPEAKER_10]: isolated, and turned into wonderful
medicine for the people that need it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Although this one isn't the healthiest
looking plant, wow, is it ever the darkest
[SPEAKER_10]: one I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: This thing is almost black.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many different colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, look at the color on this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got purple taco happening here.
[SPEAKER_10]: The leaf is tacoing and bending up like a
taco shell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a different strain, hey?
[SPEAKER_06]: The more it's ripe, the more it makes it
ripe, the more it shows you the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: The more you stress it, the more it thinks
it's dying, and the more resin it
[SPEAKER_10]: produces.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so this is the young field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be careful the way we walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: And planted from seed?
[SPEAKER_10]: So what kind of harvest would you get off
of this little field?
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's harvest, I will come home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take out the mails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, how we get the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all depends on the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sometimes it all depends on how the
rain falls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is a man herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he'll be taken out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I saw this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't see yet how much you're gonna
get out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to bear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's bare, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a young field that we're in
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about four weeks old.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's planted it right from seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are males and females, as cannabis
is a dioaceous plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be pulled over the next couple of
weeks, as they are starting to all flower
[SPEAKER_10]: and show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here with Esco and Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're Westmoreland Jamaica,
brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, straight up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having us here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're in this beautiful ganja.
[SPEAKER_10]: The field, I would say it's ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is ready to cut down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime, anytime.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, everything is already ripe
and excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're gonna put a lot of work in.
[SPEAKER_10]: How much time do you think it'll take and
how many people will be working on this to
[SPEAKER_10]: harvest it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's gonna be like about ten of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ten?
Ten?
[SPEAKER_08]: And normally it's gonna be like taking
like maybe two days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two days?
[SPEAKER_08]: Two days?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's work hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, hard, hard work.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are working ten to fifteen hour
days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whole days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whole days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whole days.
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ganja farming is not the work for the
lazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is extremely difficult and hard work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you could feel the sun beating down
on us right now, it's a very hot sun right
[SPEAKER_10]: now here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the plants are loving it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could smell the resin hundreds of feet
away from the field.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys have been breeding and
growing these strains for many years?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, many years, many years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of different types.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there are.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's one thing I say about
Jamaica all the time, how you can smell
[SPEAKER_10]: all these flavors and strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these are all from the same bag of
seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet, there's so much variation and
nice variation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of like, I really saw very
little that wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything, like 95% of what I saw was
really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: But everything is like, as I say,
Jamaica is like a blessing still,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like from the Father above,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the farmers, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a current.
[SPEAKER_08]: A current, I just say, you see?
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole globalization of different
energy towards herb, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, it's been a long time that
they've been, you know, prosecuting and
[SPEAKER_10]: jailing us for this plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look forward to the day when,
you know, guys like you that are doing
[SPEAKER_10]: this hard work can be a lot more respected
by your community instead of bashed on and
[SPEAKER_10]: fight with because you guys are doing the
good work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this is a medicine that can cure
disease, that can improve the quality of
[SPEAKER_10]: life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Rasta community, the Jamaican
community has known this for decades.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've been singing about it in their
music.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, most of the people here that farm
ganja, they have an in-depth knowledge
[SPEAKER_10]: about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not like the knowledge comes from
experience and from inhaling the resins.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not learned in a book and you don't
go to school for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is real experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cicadas are joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask when harvesting,
do you cut or do you just pull the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing right out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally, we just pull it right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull it right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was looking because we have
other ones over here and you got the
[SPEAKER_02]: starter fields and I'm like, they just rip
these things right out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally, when you pull it out,
it's normally still alive for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know if it's different,
but for us, to the impression of seeing
[SPEAKER_08]: it, when you pull it out alive,
it's like it's still alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Compared to if you cut the life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, compared to if you cut the life.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you cut the life now, it's like
you're cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you pull it now, you're pulling
with the main root and the latter root.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it comes out when you hang it now,
it automatically just dries slowly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when it is cut... It droops before you
get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it starts getting... Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is farmer knowledge he's laying on
you right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hot and so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the plants pull out so nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so nice, they can just grab a handful
and it's just... I mean, this is like
[SPEAKER_02]: having a month out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally stain your hand orange.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that awesome?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me some of that stain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you see, this is a lot of medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you see, because you guys teach a lot
of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at first, the microscope there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time I really saw... You've
never seen it before?
[SPEAKER_08]: I never seen it before, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the first thing I ever seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it's about here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched Discovery and I watched a couple
of documentaries about the herbs and all
[SPEAKER_08]: of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could see the weed, the herbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really close?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it a National Geographic documentary?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were my photos.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were you?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my photos.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tell you, I tell you.
[SPEAKER_10]: First they show a bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they go closer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they go closer and they're
purple.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my photo.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: One love, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: One love.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a small world we are living in right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's telling me the first time he ever saw
a glandular trichome on a National
[SPEAKER_10]: Geographic documentary, which was on the
Discovery Channel, in fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a TV show called Taboo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they did a show on cannabis and they
hired me to take three photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm here with you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, this is the best thing, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the greatest thing, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: At first, I really see something like
that, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, listen, what we're going to do is
we're going to take a little break because
[SPEAKER_10]: the sun is beating down on us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go hang out under the hut
where the herbs, they have some herbs
[SPEAKER_10]: drying right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe eat a little food, drink a little
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to make my way out here,
take some macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to get working,
John.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to pull some plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get the buckets.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to tag the plants that we want
to get.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing fresh frozen field run today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, the 20 gallon bags aren't
working out for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Five gallons are great.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mind running two or three batches.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just extracting the resin off of these
plants and showing these guys with a
[SPEAKER_10]: purity the incredible work that they've
been doing all these years.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
Respect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some breadfruit and plantain.
[SPEAKER_09]: More.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, with the ackee.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is real food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Food that was never packaged.
[SPEAKER_10]: No need to spend expensive money on trucks
and gasoline to move the food around and
[SPEAKER_10]: package it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right off the tree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right off the tree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Livety.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real livety right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so here we are and we're showing these
ganja farmers exactly what they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and something they've never seen
before.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're team working it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Team working it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking and loving the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen field or field fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're finally getting down to business,
John and B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh frozen field.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got an oversized bucket.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went and picked a bunch of plants you
saw out in the fields.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cut them all down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we pulled them all out, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: The roots are still attached.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the first one that John found and
we sort of pulled out together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was a joint effort on this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like check this one out.
[SPEAKER_10]: A joint effort.
[SPEAKER_10]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we're going to strip this guy
down real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all you have to do when frozen
in the field here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Takes pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just nice because it just came out of the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still got roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just snaps off so quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can tell, too, that it hasn't been
getting, you know, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm almost eating this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it had.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually some pretty good natural
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your greens are good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what we're going to do is we're
while John's doing this, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_10]: we've got an oversized bucket this time,
so we don't have as much of a spill.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put all the buckets,
all the bags, sorry, inside of one
[SPEAKER_10]: another.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got them hanging right here with the
beautiful ganja field in the background.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know the order of the bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: We go purple number 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the smallest of the screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a sieve stack for those of you
that want to understand what's going on
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_10]: These screens are all different sizes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the purple bag is the smallest screen.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 25 microns.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, it's very, very small, much smaller
than even those little heads that I was
[SPEAKER_10]: showing you on the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are between one hundred and sixty
and like forty five microns.
[SPEAKER_10]: The majority of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So microns is just a measurement,
a method of measurement.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we start with twenty five.
[SPEAKER_10]: We go next with the white bag is the forty
five.
[SPEAKER_10]: After the forty five, it's the gold.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the gold.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my favorite bags right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys will see why when when we
release the bags from the water after
[SPEAKER_10]: mixing and we show you what we've caught.
[SPEAKER_10]: So to give you an idea of the process,
[SPEAKER_10]: to give you an idea of the process,
what we're doing is we're freezing those
[SPEAKER_10]: little trichome glands, those little
microscopic glands.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're freezing them because they're
brittle.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're encased in wax.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, we freeze the little micron,
the wax membranes of the trichomes by
[SPEAKER_10]: freezing them to become brittle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And once we put the water in the ice and
we start mixing it all up, what's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: happen is those little resin glands are
going to break free from their trichome
[SPEAKER_10]: body and they will sink in the water due
to their gravity, due to their density.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still affected by gravity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most things float in the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: All this plant matter will float in the
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: The resin heads will drop off,
break, and sink and they'll fall through
[SPEAKER_10]: these series of screens.
[SPEAKER_10]: And simply put, we will pull the screens
up and collect the resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the things we're going to need,
I'll get one of our audience members to
[SPEAKER_10]: possibly grab, is a nice straight kind of
clean stick that I can mix with.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have to do the water thing
first.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll let this sit for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let it sit and get cold.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think that right now it's
probably pretty warm resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to show you guys this.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so nice, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that beautiful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know I can because it's like...
Just want to give you a little close-up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always a good idea too to look at
your bags when you're about to use them
[SPEAKER_10]: and make sure they're clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a bunch of dirt on the outside
of this screen, it's going to go to the
[SPEAKER_10]: top of the next screen and all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So always make sure the outsides of the
bags are clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also see there's a band of fabric
that goes around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_10]: When they're inside out, that band of
fabric isn't there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is how we know what the right side
is for the bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also the label's on the inside so when you
fold them over, you can read it properly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these bags are from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathmandu, Nepal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Home of some of the original dreads,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: The holy men of India, Sadhus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really cool guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go figure, they smoke a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we'll just get these fit tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually they fit a little tighter in the
bucket but I don't think we're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: have too much of a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: These bags are stiff enough, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there we've got our sieve.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to pull the blue one out just a
little bit and I'm going to wrap the rest
[SPEAKER_10]: of the bags around the top.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what this is going to do for us is
it's going to ensure that when we're
[SPEAKER_10]: mixing and when we mix, this whole thing
is going to spin, I can tell you right
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: The resin or the leaf matter, I should
say, won't go in between the bags and
[SPEAKER_10]: contaminate our hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's proper.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got some water.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll top this up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I want to get a bunch of ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is directly behind you in a big bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just being so quiet here because I'm
hitting the tides by the smell of this
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the stick coming in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ice picks work well.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you know how to use them,
they do, otherwise they go right through
[SPEAKER_10]: your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps I'm not doing this because there's
no first aid station for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our second run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: First run was bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can't see, but there's 15 people
behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get the cell phones out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're filming and we're educating them
at the same time we're educating you
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice for some big chunks to fall in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need to break them all down to
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whack.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a whole good stick.
[SPEAKER_10]: All sticked up.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so this is cold now,
John.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is real cold.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a nice temperature here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can start pushing, cutting those
nuggets down on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will join you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, we do this everywhere, hey?
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just fly all around the world and hang
out with cool ganja-oriented people and
[SPEAKER_10]: make the good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make the good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm being a little rough with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just getting it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: Want to get her done.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the whole purpose.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can feel the cool air coming off of
this bucket incredibly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already creating a thermal climate.
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels like air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in air conditioning right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do see a few seeds in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not many at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a plant can still produce melty
bubble with seed, but generally we know
[SPEAKER_10]: this about the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once it starts producing seeds,
then it puts an enormous amount of its
[SPEAKER_10]: energy into the production of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it's pretty much factual
that the THC production goes down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he said?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not cutting anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we'll dump that bucket in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, it's a Heineken bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to fill it, not full of
beer, full of resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only actually a few more buds on
here, but maybe we'll bring a few buds
[SPEAKER_10]: home dry for Mr. Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scott actually asked me to pull aside four
to six of the nicest buds we found.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, obviously the nicest buds we found
are in this bucket right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the next nicest buds we've put aside
for you, Scott.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, by the way, I'll be smoking
those nice buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get some ice on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm doing here is I'm just kind of
stripping it off of the stalk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pulling some stalk out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a bud like that can get this in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can expose more resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really want to cut it up,
but it doesn't hurt to pull all the stalk
[SPEAKER_02]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave it in there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have any resin on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I want it to sit right on top.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that way, we'll get it into the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that's important,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're using the fresh material,
it'll float up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't want to go down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can put a layer of ice and a layer
of herb, and then put more ice on top,
[SPEAKER_10]: and then another layer of herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you just layer it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what it's going to do is right now,
those crystals, those tiny little resin
[SPEAKER_10]: lines, are freezing solid right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is the magic of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The magic comes from out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We finish it off in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magic's right there, growing out in that
beautiful sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think I've ever made
bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody's made bubble hash
with a field of fresh wheat in the
[SPEAKER_02]: background.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it in Switzerland next to
France.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it in five football fields of
outdoor cannabis in the north of
[SPEAKER_10]: Switzerland, in Volhusen, near Zurich.
[SPEAKER_10]: Literally, whatever the size of a football
field is, picture six of them right next
[SPEAKER_10]: to each other, and it was just cannabis as
far as the eye could see.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've also done it in Grange Hill,
Westmoreland Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was the other place I did it?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a ganja field.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three places in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my fourth one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it in a field.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's always in this hut.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you guys have seen the photos on my
Instagram and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Johnny, that's probably pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just freezing the resin off my hands
because they're so sticky right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got that going on, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ice might do a good job, but no,
apparently not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I'm hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course you're hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, why don't we have a bowl?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a bowl sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to grab the pipe and have some
hash or what?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to let this sit.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to let it sit for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally, one of the things about water
hash, although you guys probably won't
[SPEAKER_10]: have this problem, but in the rest of the
world, the terpene content is sometimes,
[SPEAKER_10]: well, almost always never as strong as the
tropical grown sun that you can get in
[SPEAKER_10]: environments like Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this resin generally in water can leach
out some of those smells and tastes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't want to leave it in water for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something always to keep in mind
that it's unnecessary to leave the resin
[SPEAKER_10]: in the water too long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now we're cooling it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're kind of trading in one for the
other.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you wouldn't want to forget about this
for a long period of time and go do a
[SPEAKER_10]: bunch of stuff and then come back and mix
it and then leave it for a much longer
[SPEAKER_10]: period and come back.
[SPEAKER_10]: The water is going to start acting like a
solvent because, of course, water is a
[SPEAKER_10]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_10]: It breaks things down.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, this is a solventless process,
which my good friend Nickatee,
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys know about
selected Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a Colorado DJ.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty good guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: He does water hash like this, but he calls
it solventless.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he gets into it with people because
they say actually water is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he has to explain to them that
this is a mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not actually using water as a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, because the water is going to be
a different color every single time you
[SPEAKER_10]: run water hash, there is a process being
done that is like a solvent.
[SPEAKER_10]: The water is leaching things out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that said, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny, should I start mixing up the
medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Start mixing up the medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone want to maybe just check the clock
and mark down the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll start turning.
[SPEAKER_08]: 1.20.
[SPEAKER_10]: 1.30?
[SPEAKER_08]: 1.20 equals 1.30.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to do this for about 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bit thick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring up that level a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You feel that now?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's moving better.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too thick.
[SPEAKER_10]: More ice, though.
[SPEAKER_10]: When it's too thick, like it was,
you need to put a little bit more water
[SPEAKER_10]: in.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll melt the ice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then it gets too thin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you've got to put a little bit more
ice, and you'll find it's a fine line on
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of learning these subtle nuances of
these variables that will change the game
[SPEAKER_10]: for you, depending on the temperature,
your environment, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_10]: the herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, we're going to mix this
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: For another 15 minutes, I'm going to turn
the camera off so some of my friends can
[SPEAKER_10]: help me.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll catch up with you in a few
minutes once we've got this batch mixed
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so bong break.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to hit some hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been working hard here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the materials all sitting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ready to pull.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got our small clean bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that you might not be
aware of.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you're making bubble hash out in
the middle of the hills, you're going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be required to clean your bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we've got is a bucket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the bucket has ice in it and clean
water.
[SPEAKER_10]: So once we pull the bags immediately,
we're going to rinse them really well,
[SPEAKER_10]: washing them almost with our hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to keep the ice mixture in
here high so it doesn't melt away.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to ensure the resin stays
cold and breaks off the screen easily and
[SPEAKER_10]: goes into the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want that resin dehydrating and
melting to the screen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did a paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the lighter wet?
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the flint wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll let you light the next lighter.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got one, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a little bit of a bubble hash
we made the first day we were here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our third day here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're on our second run.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's do this.
Let's.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we start with the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how we separate the chafe from the
resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just going to reinsure by holding
here that nothing gets pulled apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that color that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's creamy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's creamy golden.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful gold.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can tell we definitely ran about a
half pound.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what fits in these bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally, when you've got a big most of
this is ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how often do you get washed with resin?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take a bath in this stuff.
That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could definitely smell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so can you hand that off to one of our
friends and we'll get that either poured
[SPEAKER_10]: into a plastic bag or wherever you want
to.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to get clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: out of the bag right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the that's the key.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it could be thrown away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Literally, we could throw that right in
the bush or if you want to save it and try
[SPEAKER_10]: to make coconut oil to use the resin,
you can save it as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't want to, I understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: That bag will need to be flipped inside
out and then rinsed maybe with a bottle of
[SPEAKER_10]: water to get all the herb off.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it can just be hung.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So 160.
[SPEAKER_10]: This water is clean, John.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very little contaminant got through.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So first bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: The red color on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 190.
[SPEAKER_10]: So generally, this bag is what we call the
contaminant catch.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not what we're looking for,
but at the same time, it's important to
[SPEAKER_10]: use the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: In order to get this out of the hash that
we're going to collect later.
[SPEAKER_10]: So clean in the first bag right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't wash that in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll stick to all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to rinse that with a small bottle
of water.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is cleaning great.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So 160.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not expecting much in this bag either.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a very large size micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: I suspect due to the sun grown nature of
this resin, we're going to find smaller
[SPEAKER_10]: heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that doesn't surprise me too much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, this is really more of a
contaminant bag than anything so when you
[SPEAKER_10]: see hash that looks pretty decent,
you're happy about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be very happy to see the lard
and all we got on the first day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is definitely a substantially
nicer herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Substantially nicer herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, of course, the herb always looks
the best when it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Growing in the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those plants were so nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So listen, if you're thinking of going on
a vacation anytime soon, I suggest you get
[SPEAKER_10]: yourself a set of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a container.
[SPEAKER_10]: And get yourself a ticket to Jamaica
because this place is growing the fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all you people that come here and say
you can't find good resin, that's on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't blame Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, is that cold enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like some more ice on that?
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of ice, which we always say keep
it cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colder it is, it breaks it off so
that's how we're cleaning the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comparing that at the last little place we
visited there the other day, rubbing the
[SPEAKER_02]: ice on the bottom of the bag actually
worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the color of that water,
John.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a tiny little green in it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the fresh that we ran, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got some gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got another little pile of 120.
[SPEAKER_10]: After this bag is the bag we expect to
start seeing some resin in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now keep in mind, we ran fresh herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other day we ran dry herb and we ran a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that dry herb, I suspect, was more than
what we ran this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see when we get the next few
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's more weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see when we pull it all out.
[SPEAKER_10]: The 73 was amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one's pulling through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: This 90 has nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No joke.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pulled right out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to pull the microscope out and
make sure the bag itself is accurately in
the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the 73 is going to be epic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be because we did the same thing
the other day.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is way less 90 than the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: One,
[SPEAKER_10]: two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wash that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you wash that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: My hand is cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is cold in here, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to step over here instead of not
being in front of the camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one's feeling heavy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We already know this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the other ones, I pulled them out
immediately, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember yesterday, the last time,
how much resin we got on the 73?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we already know it's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always happy with the 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm wearing 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that's going to be the best bag,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely going to be one of the
best.
[SPEAKER_10]: Must have a puck of bubble hash in there,
too, because this is snow draining.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try and snatch that over this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe try and collect it a little bit
better?
[SPEAKER_10]: Pulled out a little leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to show you this bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how much resin is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the quality of this resin inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 45 and the 25, what we're seeing with
these tropical sativas, it's just so much
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're profiling on,
the 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 25, because we haven't
microplanned it yet, even looks better
[SPEAKER_02]: than the 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been talking about, we can't
wait to smoke on that 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're back at home with the
Indica, the 25 isn't anything that's that
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we're looking for right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't be this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can get another drying screen and close
that one off if you like.
[SPEAKER_11]: But not carry it down to so much,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find all this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find all this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find all this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a little bit of resin on that 75.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're touching, they're not drying.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're not touching, they're drying.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this right here, don't do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did I call it the 73?
[SPEAKER_08]: Born in 1973.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my year.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just happened to be the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how it happened, but truly,
for the longest time, the 73 was the one
[SPEAKER_10]: we all wanted.
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally, at home, love the 73 and the
90.
[SPEAKER_10]: The black bag is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, the 45 coming down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually cleaned out pretty fast,
John.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a lot of hash in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can hear, everybody in the
background is really enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's our next poll, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once again, another very big pile.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, this little pile is 45,
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: We could have stayed here all day and ran
literally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize how little or how much
the plants would be weighing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you this was less than a half pound
that we ran.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just from the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and now some people,
they don't know where the resin is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the resin is, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they're like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really important that you clean your bags
good when you're in the hot, humid,
[SPEAKER_10]: tropical environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: The resin can stay on the screen,
and each time it'll build up, that resin
[SPEAKER_10]: will start acting as a solvent,
potentially break down your screen and
[SPEAKER_10]: make it a little more brittle.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I've seen in Jamaica when people have
given bags who haven't taken care of them,
[SPEAKER_10]: they let them get wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: They dry them in piles like this so the
water never really dries out.
[SPEAKER_10]: The wind needs to go all around and dry it
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're stuck together like this,
you'll get a little bit of moisture stay
[SPEAKER_10]: in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens over time is it degrades the
quality of the material and the bags
[SPEAKER_10]: become less effective in their use.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you had them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to keep care of them here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hurrying up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we only have one bag left,
so it's easy to hurry up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's big, so you know there's some
resin in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reason why this bag is having
such a hard time is... Whoa!
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for a little explosion?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes you gotta massage the bottom of
the screen.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be enough to start.
Now,
[SPEAKER_10]: that was actually a really good example.
[SPEAKER_10]: This just has resin in it, but if you let
your screens get dirty, this is what
[SPEAKER_10]: they'll do.
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't release the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is releasing now, which just means
there was a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other ones are in nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we've taken, I don't know if John
mentioned it, but we took the one pressing
[SPEAKER_10]: screen full of most of the bubble we
pulled already.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we put it inside the box, our cooler,
that we have the ice packs in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll ensure that this doesn't get
too warm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, this stuff would stink so bad,
they'd smell it like 20 feet before you
[SPEAKER_10]: got to the roadblock.
[SPEAKER_10]: So good to put it in there and make it
cold so they can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because let's be honest, we don't need to
be buying them breakfast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice little pile of 25, nice and dark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you open it right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like there's a lot of water in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, you can put that in the styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so that was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Little fresh frozen field run.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first of many.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just our first little example.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just did a five gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: We weren't sure if we were pulling a
pound.
[SPEAKER_10]: We weren't sure if we were pulling a half
pound.
[SPEAKER_10]: I suspect it was just a half pound or a
little less, but we'll really be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: figure it out by the amounts of resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can show you that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, what we just pulled on top.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the 45 and 25.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice little pile.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then our other two piles, which you
can see the 73 is that monster pile right
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: This 45 and this 73 is really what we came
here to get today.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right,
[SPEAKER_10]: so I guess now all there is really to do
is to dump the water that we've that we've
[SPEAKER_10]: already used, clean up the pails in the
environment, and we'll take this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically now the unfortunate part of this
process is it's really hard to do anything
[SPEAKER_10]: with this now in the environment that
we're in.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to get it into a colder air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we'll be doing is we'll be
microplaning it with this tool right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is a microplane right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like a little grater type tool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of you in the audience probably know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just grate that down the same way
you would grate ginger or cheese.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to grate that hash and that
hash is going to fall in a powder and rain
[SPEAKER_10]: down on top of your cardboard.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use parchment paper upon the cardboard
so it doesn't stick to the cardboard and
[SPEAKER_10]: you don't lose any resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just a matter of kind of shh,
shh, shh, shh.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see it fall like a dust and you just
allow it to collect and spread out
[SPEAKER_10]: everywhere like you're painting on the
parchment paper so you cover everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: From that point here in Jamaica it doesn't
take very long before the heat of the day
[SPEAKER_10]: just evaporates any moisture that's left
in that resin and it really dries the hash
[SPEAKER_10]: pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I won't be surprised if we're smoking
quite a bit of it later tonight but
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely by tomorrow and the next night
when Tony and Scott arrive they'll be
[SPEAKER_10]: puffing some nicely dried full melt bubble
hash that's a fresh frozen field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always a pleasure Johnny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright guys well we were just on our way
out and we saw another field on the right
[SPEAKER_10]: side of the original field we were in so
we thought we'd just sort of do our final
[SPEAKER_10]: goodbye here at this beautiful
Westmoreland ganja field.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you feeling about your first ganja
field visit Johnny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how's that joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is right from this field and it's
it's a blueberry skunk 10-12 years of it
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding in this little area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just amazing like I can't say
anything else other than wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were here you would understand the
goosebumps and how I feel and and this
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful look at the ocean in the
background you just can't get over it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah the waves slapping up against the
coast behind us we've got some fresh veged
[SPEAKER_10]: plants deep in the back and then forward
here in this little patch we've got some
[SPEAKER_10]: plants that to me look like they're gonna
be pulled in the next couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_10]: tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it looks like a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're definitely rocking it here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess we're gonna take off we're
gonna head back to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a nice day in Westmoreland I wish I
could have said hello to Negril but next
[SPEAKER_10]: time and let's head home man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually let's head into this field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's head into this field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Five foot six foot tall man.
All right can we make our way home?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you shut up my camera John?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like amazing you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we leave the field of dream.
[SPEAKER_10]: Goodbye field of dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the field of dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah he got the one that you put on the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you thought everyone had one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no no no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your chan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep down in the air to me put me ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big stinking helicopter flow through the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: With them call it, them call it weed
eater.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never did it when we were floating
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when we did them blind fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet out of the sky them spitting fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a little youth man with a hot
temper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig up my stinking rocket launcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know the air dispose the
helicopter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your chan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep down in the air to me put me ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon come.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your chan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep down in the air to me put me ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep down in the air to me put me ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep down in the air to me put me ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babylon come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep down in the air to me put me ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your chan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm a ganja planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja, ganja, ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja, ganja, ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja, ganja, ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja, ganja,
[SPEAKER_01]: ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for
watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks
