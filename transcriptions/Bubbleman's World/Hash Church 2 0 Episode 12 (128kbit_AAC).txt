[SPEAKER_15]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: I should probably go over in here and make
sure this is muted.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, welcome everybody, Hash Church 2.0,
episode 12.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a little bit of a cold,
so you'll have to bear with me here today,
[SPEAKER_15]: feeling a little bit rough, but not too
bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was very excited to have the Dragonfly
Earth Medicine crew hit me up yesterday
[SPEAKER_15]: and say, hey, let's do a Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, all right, now with that,
let's do a Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome everyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got 150 people right now from
Candice Murth, to Jay Hendricks,
[SPEAKER_15]: to Cuban Chronic, to John Burr Fellows in
the room, 70 Miss Mama, Banzai Breeder.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, I'm gonna invite the crew in
here right away.
[SPEAKER_15]: This of course was set up by the Dragonfly
Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know all of the people that
are gonna be in the room today,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I'm quite excited to see who makes it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me just get here all the links sent
out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_15]: Gonna turn that off.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was hoping that Tim would be able to
make it.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's actually traveling today and does not
have his computer, so that was
[SPEAKER_15]: unfortunate, I guess next time.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, with Hash Church lately,
we've just been kind of doing it as a spur
[SPEAKER_15]: of the moment thing, and that's how it
goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning, Grateful Seeds, Pacific
Northwestern, Freedom Cycles, Braden
[SPEAKER_15]: Teague, Hank Runner, Mass Melts,
Woody Woody, Samuel Bench.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much appreciate the kind words.
[SPEAKER_15]: Medication Station, yes, this is a hat
from Tantalus Labs here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just live outside of Vancouver,
but they've got some beautiful greenhouses
[SPEAKER_15]: going over there with some very lovely
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's see if those links are gonna
work.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did send out the link.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see if I can send it out again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure everyone's there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually would see someone in the room by
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm all alone with 300 people,
so how's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_15]: Gonna drink some of my vitamin C water
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some ester seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if I'm gonna have any Raws
and Press videos coming out super soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some familiar faces in the room,
even though I can't see them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see your face, I can hear your face.
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming soon, coming soon, coming soon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, shit, we're gonna have to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot about headphones.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's gonna be something we're gonna
wanna do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hearing the plant father.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a little bit of reverberation
through your microphone.
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be fixed when I put my headphones
on, but if you have some too, you might
[SPEAKER_15]: wanna try and put them on as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Love the shirt, by the way, plant father.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit of lack of professionality on
my part.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very early here in beautiful British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not that early.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to get up at 6.30 to drive my
daughter to work.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what happens when you have
teenagers.
[SPEAKER_15]: You drive them to work.
[SPEAKER_15]: Their work is your work.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's going on, Josh and Kelly?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in a lot of rain here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was hard to get up this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been working around the Clark with
Harvest and just here, ready to talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super stoked.
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam just came into the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's happening with you, Steve?
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us something about GLP.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just enjoying this beautiful Sunday
morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting to get cold out here,
so it's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Switching to winter mode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Catch any fish lately with your spear
fishing equipment in the background there?
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Had to deck out the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, honestly, I went in a couple of
weeks ago, but the weather was kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: late in the season.
[SPEAKER_12]: The weather was rough.
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably have to wait until we start going
to Mexico in January.
[SPEAKER_12]: Me and my wife will be going out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Quan Yin will be going out there and
enjoying the water.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: 400 people watching at 9.05.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Still getting that reverberation through
your mic a little bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any headphones that might
help?
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes our speakers are really close to
our microphone, and that also creates a
[SPEAKER_15]: little bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: But don't worry.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jordan G.
[SPEAKER_15]: asks me, why never Breeder Steve?
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll put it out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Breeder Steve has been a longtime friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason you don't see him on Hash
Church is because I think he may have lost
[SPEAKER_15]: his mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently, me being friends with Ryan
Lee, i.e.
[SPEAKER_15]: Chimera Genetics, has been enough for him
to say that we can no longer be friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's on the Twitter late at night,
maybe under the influence of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that could be the problem
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we wish the best for Steve one day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe his alcohol dementia will dissipate
and he'll be able to join us back in the
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis community where we're nice to
each other and where we don't treat each
[SPEAKER_15]: other like high schoolers where,
oh, if you like that person, I am unable
[SPEAKER_15]: to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_15]: Last time I really experienced that was in
high school.
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't like it then, don't like it now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's sort of the short of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope everyone can understand that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the seed is curling.
[SPEAKER_15]: The seed is curling.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's put that back there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was feeling that curling seed there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_15]: Brother Dutch Blooms?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Joshua, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell us something good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he may have lost his mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, me being friends with...
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Skunkman Sam had to mute you,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna keep muting you.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you unmute yourself, I will mute you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get back to telling us something
good, Joshua.
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't mean to cut you off there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was gonna say last time we chatted,
I was all in the down and outs,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember we were talking, I had some bug
issues and I was really bumming and so I
[SPEAKER_10]: ripped out both halves.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have three parts of my greenhouse and I
ripped out the two sides that were
[SPEAKER_10]: affected.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just went drastic action, did a heat
treatment in the greenhouse thanks to Josh
[SPEAKER_10]: and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was able to pull off a beautiful
middle row in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just finishing the harvest today,
later on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got some plants blowing in the
background in front of your fan there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me making my mom's yesterday, so hold up
for the winner.
[SPEAKER_15]: Making mom.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: You select males and yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, once we get our crew in here,
I'll have Josh and Kelly sort of walk
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone through doing a little
introduction.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's definitely most of you I know,
but some I will not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the names were new to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: So once we get our full crew in here,
we'll go through that and do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the meantime, geez, what's happened
in Canada since last we spoke?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: They apparently legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I can already hear so many of you
bitching.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's prohibition 2.0.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's this, it's that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's all sorts of problems with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's all sorts of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_15]: But had I told you 20 years ago that this
day would be coming, many, many,
[SPEAKER_15]: many, many people would have not
acknowledged that it was a possibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've waited for this, our group for 20
plus 30 plus years, groups like Sam's for
[SPEAKER_15]: 40, 50 plus years and other groups of
people that are even older for 60 to 70
[SPEAKER_15]: plus years.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've been waiting for this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_15]: And although it's not ideal, it's not the
perfect scenario.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hate to compare it to alcohol
because what a terrible comparison.
[SPEAKER_15]: But when alcohol prohibition ended,
bars did not pop up on every street.
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it was 20 years before you could
put a sign in your window that said beer
[SPEAKER_15]: sold here.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was also kind of a slow sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope cannabis is faster.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the bottom line is it's not really
ideal for the community of people that
[SPEAKER_15]: have been pushing cannabis for all these
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Who it is ideal for is the other 95% of
the population who is now gaining access
[SPEAKER_15]: who otherwise did not have access.
[SPEAKER_15]: So for them, it's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: For the rest of us, we're going to
continue to fight the fight.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need our edibles.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need our concentrates.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need no THC or cannabinoid limitations.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need access more than just government
operated stores.
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, we want dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, we still have the ability
to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of provinces, Manitoba and
Quebec, I believe, are trying to keep
[SPEAKER_15]: people from growing their four allotted
plants that everyone now in the country is
[SPEAKER_15]: basically allowed to grow federally under
this new legalization regime.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, they're still going to try
and pull funds out.
[SPEAKER_15]: The police are still pulling funds out to
do enforcement, whether that enforcement
[SPEAKER_15]: is now.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw people like, oh, look, now they're
giving tickets.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just like, wow, I would have
fucking loved a ticket 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_15]: instead of having all my pot taken and
being arrested.
[SPEAKER_15]: And thrown in a cage.
[SPEAKER_15]: But oh, how soon we forget.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if many of you guys are from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you guys are all probably from the
US.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Sam, they're in Amsterdam,
AKA via the US.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can understand that federally
legalizing cannabis is going to be a good
[SPEAKER_15]: move.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear so many people complaining.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand that because they've been
paying their mortgages and all their bills
[SPEAKER_15]: with cannabis prohibition prices for so
long.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get that having that transfer over
into a government regime sort of sucks in
[SPEAKER_15]: a big way.
[SPEAKER_15]: But being able to grow our own cannabis,
being able to give access to cannabis to
[SPEAKER_15]: people who are not in our community,
to me is a win-win.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to get that off my chest.
[SPEAKER_15]: And welcome to the new faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Josh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Moon Gazer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flowers over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about what's going on in Mendon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendon area, Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening in Cali?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see your faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're in the Redwood Valley sort
of Appalachian of Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of Appalachians, we got a lot
going on with that in terms of,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, it's ungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how was it grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it grown in the Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have that sort of connection to the
place?
[SPEAKER_01]: With Cali coming online, we've definitely
seen a lot of shifts in terms of how
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to connect with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really grateful to Dispensary
Soulful, who loves telling the farmer's
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love to share our certifications,
like the Dragonfly certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And educating consumers has been a really
big step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think an important step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, Marcus, I think it is
good for a larger population to get access
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the bigger picture,
that's for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then having us, with education and
such, to just sort of slowly build that is
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hey, Josh, how do you feel that the
education has sort of helped you all move
[SPEAKER_04]: forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least have a voice in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to know where their cannabis
is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know the farmer's story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to even eat our food and come
see the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our farm is relatively accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had so many folks come and want
to learn and put their hands in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and see the worms and the life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pick a cucumber or some kale while
they're smoking the cannabis that was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been lucky to have, like I said,
places like Soulful and other shops really
[SPEAKER_01]: encouraging it and encouraging us to
continue doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something that we're looking at
up here in Canada and different places
[SPEAKER_11]: where the farm isn't necessarily on the
packaging nowadays.
[SPEAKER_11]: The packaging looks quite different than
what you would think is packaging and
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to figure out ways to keep
farmers in the loop up here as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's part of the reason why we're
having this conversation today is to see
[SPEAKER_11]: what everyone's kind of going through
within their laws and within their
[SPEAKER_11]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And within their limitations to see how we
may be able to create some congruent
[SPEAKER_11]: language and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, we really appreciate what you're
saying there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that Soulful is amazing and Eli
down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's some really good distributors
that you all are working with.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're extremely important too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe what we'll do now is we'll do a
quick check in with everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll do like a more open
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: My name's bubble man and I love the new
faces.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to say, I love the new faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Hey Rio, it's nice to see you from
ladies sativa farms and so hum.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going this morning?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's been going on in your neck of the
woods?
[SPEAKER_16]: There I am.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, here's, this is my daughter,
Olivia.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Olivia.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome, Olivia.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we're a network of small farms up
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, there's just like you guys,
I guess, uh, but we feel like we're on an
[SPEAKER_16]: Island, like a non-corporate Island,
because there's so many independent
[SPEAKER_16]: farmers that came out of the black market
and into the white market that didn't
[SPEAKER_16]: really have, uh, any of those connections
before and now are making those
[SPEAKER_16]: connections.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, it's nice to have people that are
ambitious and, and motivated to make that
[SPEAKER_16]: transition to be like a commute,
to be a community.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, that's the biggest asset that
I have is community, um, is really the
[SPEAKER_16]: strong, you know, non-contract,
non, non-corporate community.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of small farmers to just vent and dialogue
and, and see where they're going and find
[SPEAKER_16]: out, um, where those points are,
where those touch points that make it
[SPEAKER_16]: possible for the small farm to exist.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the same time, um,
just being involved in the community and
[SPEAKER_16]: helping this community evolve.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause everybody's having every issue that
I'm having, I know that I'm having all my
[SPEAKER_16]: neighbors are having the same issue.
[SPEAKER_16]: So being open to, uh, to, to other
people's struggle.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause it's all this, it's similar.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to kind of open up something you
said there in regards to the
[SPEAKER_15]: non-corporate, you know, or versus the
corporate.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I myself have a corporation.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called fresh headies.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I started it, Oh, the seed,
the seed is, is folding.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I started fresh headies in 1999,
um, I don't know why or how I knew it was
[SPEAKER_15]: probably this book that I had read called
the passport report involved in how to
[SPEAKER_15]: start international business corporations
and how to do business around the world
[SPEAKER_15]: without, you know, making missteps and
being crushed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I mean by that is particularly in
the U S where you can be sued.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, if you run your business and it's not
as a corporation, same here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_15]: and you come into some problems.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I, for instance, had a lawsuit with
Reinhardt Delp who I guess had a patent
[SPEAKER_15]: for water extraction.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had showed a meal the isolator woman,
his machine, uh, and she kind of,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, instead of selling his machine,
she jacked the idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: And my current manufacturer and a friend
of mine, Eldon actually came up with the
[SPEAKER_15]: concept of the first isolator bags.
[SPEAKER_15]: I of course went to sell the bags for
Mila.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a kind of a falling out and I ended
up making my own bags, not really knowing
[SPEAKER_15]: the Reinhardt story, but luckily what I
had done was I had created a corporation
[SPEAKER_15]: for myself to operate my business under.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and that really saved me in a sense,
because when I got sued by Reinhardt,
[SPEAKER_15]: some years later, um, he was suing my
corporation and only the things that were
[SPEAKER_15]: under the umbrella of my corporation were
allowed to be sued.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, it meant that my home and all of my
families, you know, my, my university
[SPEAKER_15]: trusts for my kids and all of these things
that I had set up, they were protected by
[SPEAKER_15]: this corporation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So whenever I hear corporation or
corporate, you know, the model said in a
[SPEAKER_15]: negative way, cause we all think of like a
corporation as like, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: Monsanto, this big evil corporation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also think like, man, like bubble bags
has been a corporation for almost 20
[SPEAKER_15]: years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wonder, I wonder if that's a bad
thing or a good thing, or is it how you
[SPEAKER_15]: direct your corporation that makes it bad
or good?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, or do we imply that if we incorporate,
uh, we have become the machine we have,
[SPEAKER_15]: we have, we have assimilated into this
machine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on
that, uh, uh, in regards to, do we protect
[SPEAKER_15]: ourselves?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we protect our families by
incorporating or or do we just sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: leave that to the side and hope that no
one sues us, uh, for everything that we've
[SPEAKER_15]: tried to, tried to create and earn over
the years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I could have, you know, in my
lawsuit, I could have potentially lost
[SPEAKER_15]: everything had it not been a corporation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And had I not been an actual human being,
because in the end, what we did was we
[SPEAKER_15]: asked the mouthpieces, that's my nickname
for lawyers, um, to sort of stand aside
[SPEAKER_15]: and let us communicate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I started communicating with
Reinhardt, um, I found out that he was
[SPEAKER_15]: just a human being and that I was a human
being, that he had been wronged,
[SPEAKER_15]: that the, that the isolator bags were in
fact created based on his machine,
[SPEAKER_15]: the ice cold extractor, and the bubble
bags being a takeoff of the isolator bags
[SPEAKER_15]: were then in breach of this man's patent.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I ended up settling with him and
paying him a good chunk of money and
[SPEAKER_15]: feeling kind of good about that being one
of only a few companies worldwide that
[SPEAKER_15]: makes these water extraction bags that I
put some money into Reinhardt's pocket
[SPEAKER_15]: because, uh, because it was the right
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, from my perspective, it is the
wrong term.
[SPEAKER_16]: The corporate is just a legal entity
attached structure.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, I'm in the natural food business as
well.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, you know, the history of the
natural food business was independent,
[SPEAKER_16]: small natural food businesses in the
seventies network of these independent
[SPEAKER_16]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and then small distributors that were
regional that would bring food to these
[SPEAKER_16]: independent.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was a really an independent business
network that then united natural foods and
[SPEAKER_16]: whole foods.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so these, these, uh, you know,
investment companies that could leverage
[SPEAKER_16]: large amounts of public investment that
then put, uh, either bought out or put it,
[SPEAKER_16]: put, uh, put the small independent
business out of business.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I mean is, but isn't that
something that naturally happens?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like for, well, I just think that it seems
to be this natural human thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a perfect example that I would use is
the mom and pop dealers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's, let's think about the mom and pop
dealers across the U S.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, there's, there were tens of thousands
of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: These were people that deal dealt out of
their homes.
[SPEAKER_15]: They sold to their friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: They sold to their families.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when dispensaries came into being,
they literally crushed those mom and pop
[SPEAKER_15]: dealers almost out of existence.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those, those mom and pop dealers were
forced to kind of wholesale their product
[SPEAKER_15]: to a dispensary now because they weren't
able to like compete with the hours and
[SPEAKER_15]: the amount of product and the opportunity
that people had when they went to a
[SPEAKER_15]: dispensary to pick from, you know,
a hundred different types of bud or hashes
[SPEAKER_15]: or edibles or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not talked about so much here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: We talk about how the LPs are sort of
crushing the dispensaries out of
[SPEAKER_15]: existence.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the dispensaries are the little guy
now, but we never talk about when the
[SPEAKER_15]: dispensaries were the big guys coming to
crush the little mom and pop operations
[SPEAKER_15]: out of the dealing that they were doing
out of their homes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I remember the cannabis scenario
20 years ago here in Canada, and there was
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of these people helping pay their
mortgage and helping pay for their life by
[SPEAKER_15]: selling herb.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when the dispensaries came in and some
of these dispensaries were doing 30,
[SPEAKER_15]: 40 grand, a day, well, that was money that
was taken out from all of these little
[SPEAKER_15]: places.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I just see it happening on a
bigger level.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just seems to be, is it this evil
corporation or is it this natural thing
[SPEAKER_15]: that we do when we try to scale up and
give people access?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very hard to give access to people
around the globe on a grassroots level.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I've noticed being a,
you know, starting from grassroots
[SPEAKER_15]: activism, from being a hemp activist back
in the day, you know, where we were just
[SPEAKER_15]: like a small group in Manitoba and we were
turning on, you know, maybe a hundred or
[SPEAKER_15]: 200 or a thousand or 2000 people here and
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: But once it got and built into,
you know, the Manitoba Harvest Company
[SPEAKER_15]: that my partner started and were selling
in places like Whole Foods and Krieger's
[SPEAKER_15]: and Safeways and all over these grocery
stores.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now suddenly they were doing what they
wanted to do, which was touching tens of
[SPEAKER_15]: thousands, hundreds of thousands,
if not millions of people.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then there's this sort of thing that
happens when you do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where, you know, do we lose sight of the
roots that we came from when our plant
[SPEAKER_15]: grows 15 to 20 feet away from those roots?
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can, you know, the top bud cannot
see the roots.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I sometimes wonder if that's what's
happening to us, that we can no longer see
[SPEAKER_15]: our roots as we grow and grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, what's the answer?
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we maintain integrity?
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we maintain our humanness when
we're operating under a corporation,
[SPEAKER_15]: which clearly has no soul?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think, I just wanted to comment,
like, I think it's, you're hitting it
[SPEAKER_10]: right on and pushing the, it's the scale,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's mega versus what size is the
corporation?
[SPEAKER_10]: How big do we need, how big do we need to
service?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we need to be, you know, the big
corporation that serves all, what's the
[SPEAKER_10]: one that, US Foods or whatever,
that serves all the restaurants here in
[SPEAKER_10]: the States.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you see it at the back of every
restaurant, Cisco.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we need to be that scale or do we need
to be the scale of where, like what you
were talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: You were just talking about the dispensary
in town.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was able to have 50 strains,
you know, in their store, but they were
[SPEAKER_10]: also able to buy from, you know,
five years ago in Washington, they were
[SPEAKER_10]: able to buy from small, smallish mom and
pop growers that were growing eight,
[SPEAKER_10]: 10, 20 lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were doing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were making a hundred grand a year,
60 grand a year, taking care of their
[SPEAKER_10]: families and putting more money into the
people, the people's pockets.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like, as it scales up, just like our
food system did over the whatever amount
[SPEAKER_10]: of time, you know, it, it's not even
corporations because a lot of our food
[SPEAKER_10]: farms are, are sole proprietors or
they're, they're owned by individual
[SPEAKER_10]: families and they're just massive.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the problem is, is there's too
much money going into one entity and not
[SPEAKER_10]: being spread evenly amongst the populace,
you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of, that's my thoughts on
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could somehow, and a cannabis is a
really good opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been saying this forever to like
rewrite the rules and it could really
[SPEAKER_10]: affect food and business, you know,
if we could somehow harness ourselves and
[SPEAKER_10]: not become, you know, these big brands,
I won't call anyone out, but you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: not become these huge Nike brands that,
you know, have swoosh symbols,
[SPEAKER_10]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: The, the, the people, you know,
they have, you end up doing distribution
[SPEAKER_10]: chains and growing weed in California and
sending it to North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, give me a break, you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel you, I feel you, especially from a
farming standpoint.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you know, that, that sort of farm
to table experience is just not something
[SPEAKER_15]: you're going to get even shopping at whole
foods and buying the seemingly nicest
[SPEAKER_15]: looking and best product you can.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nothing compared to going to the
farm.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm caught in this dichotomy of loving
the idea of giving access to all of the
[SPEAKER_15]: people that need it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause let's be honest, we all have great
stash, you know, here I'm puffing things
[SPEAKER_15]: both medicinally and recreationally that I
constantly have this guilt over when
[SPEAKER_15]: people are like, my four year old son has
a brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_15]: My lupus is killing me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I need access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: I live in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just this constant stories where
I'm like, okay, like, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_15]: get these people access any other way than
this model.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I love what you're saying,
Joshua, Joshua, in regards to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: changing the game up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we know the cannabis has not,
you know, it's been, it's been segregated
[SPEAKER_15]: for all these years.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been down in the basement locked away
literally.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now it's able to come back out of the
basement.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope, you know, I have faith in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: That it will be a guiding light that even
corporations that have nefarious sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: agendas are going to be affected by this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll never forget my partner,
Martin Moravchik, who was one of the
[SPEAKER_15]: founders of Manitoba Harvest and one of my
original hemp partners and a good friend
[SPEAKER_15]: saying to me, when we planted our first
hemp field in 1995, it was a five acre
[SPEAKER_15]: field.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was off the side of the highway.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said to me, you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to change the way people
think.
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, just seeing this, and being
around this and the vibrational
[SPEAKER_15]: frequencies that are coming off of these
plants are going to change the way people
[SPEAKER_15]: think.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was 20 plus years ago,
23 years ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I look at it now, and although we
have all of our little disagreements and
[SPEAKER_15]: arguments about how it's playing out,
I have to say it really has changed the
[SPEAKER_15]: way people think.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was step one in the changing of the way
people think.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the last step in really sort
of changing the way people think has been
[SPEAKER_15]: these wonderful, beautiful children who
have acquired sicknesses and have used
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis to help those sicknesses.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that not the last leg of prohibition
standing right there getting chopped down?
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's going to argue against sick
children?
[SPEAKER_15]: It just seems like we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted just to kind of tag back
into the farming analogy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Technology really is helping us out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And coming from an organic, regenerative
standpoint, often people don't want to
[SPEAKER_10]: involve technology because it kind of has
been fueled a lot of bad and misuse and
[SPEAKER_10]: fuel, actual fuel.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I had the opportunity when I was in
the Midwest years ago to work for an
[SPEAKER_10]: aeroponic lettuce grow that was inside a
warehouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a financial guy that started
the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the whole basis of it was it saved
money.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he wasn't coming at it from an
environmental standpoint, but it was
[SPEAKER_10]: cheaper to grow lettuce indoors in a
warehouse in Minnesota than it was to grow
[SPEAKER_10]: it in California and ship it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess my point is that as we are
growing in a community, we really need to
[SPEAKER_10]: tap into the knowledge of the technology
and everything that's out there,
[SPEAKER_10]: not discard certain things so that we can
produce locally, produce where we are and
[SPEAKER_10]: support our air quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Steve, I wanted to hear a little bit
from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've gone from a small grower to a
really large corporation and had to have
[SPEAKER_04]: jumped a lot of hoops in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your take on all of this now that
you've really, really entered sort of the
[SPEAKER_04]: corporate market and what kind of good
things have come out of it and what kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of difficulties have come out of it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I wrestle the beast every
single day.
[SPEAKER_12]: The struggle is real as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of catch-22s when it
comes to freeing this plant and
[SPEAKER_12]: rescheduling it and doing all the things
that we've talked about should be done for
[SPEAKER_12]: years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Example, if we reschedule this plant,
that's going to open up interstate
[SPEAKER_12]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really going to drive big
corporations.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all going to grow it in one spot
and ship it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go all over the world,
let alone state to state.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, you kind of got to be careful
what you ask for.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, yeah, farm to table,
mom and pop shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody wants that connection to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: The plant is their connection to the earth
in a lot of ways, to the soil in a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: ways.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to remove the farmer from the product,
like so many dispensers here in Nevada
[SPEAKER_12]: have tried, is definitely the wrong
approach.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think once you build your corporation
off of, example, Green Life, I try to
[SPEAKER_12]: build integrity into my company.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're indoors, we're in Nevada,
but we try to be sustainable as possible
[SPEAKER_12]: considering what we're able to work with
and work around.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think if you do things the right way
for the right reasons, you can have a
[SPEAKER_12]: corporation that's not necessarily the
root of all evil.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could be that shining light and
actually bring medicine to sick people in
[SPEAKER_12]: abundance versus just serving your
neighbor and your friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I think it's a double edged
sword.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you got to be careful how we play
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope in 10, 20 years we look back and
laugh at these days that we made a plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: You had to get a license to grow a plant
to help people.
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now we're trying to change the
game a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have all these very conservative
people who've been brainwashed their
[SPEAKER_12]: entire lives to think this is a drug.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's our duty to kind of help
educate them to the right path.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we're all experiencing it on
all levels and keep fighting the good
[SPEAKER_12]: fight.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wade?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going on with you, Wade?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the struggle is real for you
all too, especially for getting medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: out with the Colladrius Network,
really being able to get medicine out to
[SPEAKER_04]: the children.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the most imperative missions
that we have as farmers and as cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: growers and as activists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's been going on with you and your
struggles and successes?
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for inviting me in this morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's a very challenging time for a
lot of the reasons that have been spoken
[SPEAKER_17]: about here.
[SPEAKER_17]: For Colladrius Network, it's all pretty
much bad news, I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_17]: We put a lot of effort last year in
California into getting a bill.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, bubble man, would you mute your mic
for a second?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, sorry bud.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's coming through strong.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we've got a bill through the
legislature, Senate Bill 829, which would
[SPEAKER_17]: have created a specific license type for
compassionate use.
[SPEAKER_17]: And long story short, the governor vetoed
it on the very last day it was possible to
[SPEAKER_17]: do so.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the Colladrius Network is an
underground free market entity again.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were well on our way to creating a
not-for-profit foundation and some other
[SPEAKER_17]: activities that would have allowed us to
go forward under state law.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now state law is back to it is illegal
to donate or give cannabis in any form,
[SPEAKER_17]: especially to children.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's all I can really say about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that for myself, some of the
families that I've helped over the years,
[SPEAKER_17]: what we're doing right now in the
Colladrius Network is we're trying to put
[SPEAKER_17]: together packages for all of the families
that we've been helping and get them
[SPEAKER_17]: enough of the products that they're using
so that they are good for the coming year.
[SPEAKER_17]: State law allows our activity up until
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're hustling pretty hard at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_17]: To try and get together, like I said,
whatever the family needs for the coming
[SPEAKER_17]: year in hopes that a year from now,
the legislature will have passed a bill
[SPEAKER_17]: similar that allows compassionate use.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the governor will sign it this time
because it's a new governor coming.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's more friendly to cannabis in his
own way, I think.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's kind of a challenging moment,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_17]: In the work of Colladrius Network and some
of the families we've been helping.
[SPEAKER_17]: To make it very specific, I know Forrest
was invited to join us this morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: Silas, his son, has been having a lot of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's maturing into a young man.
[SPEAKER_17]: And all the hormonal changes are making
for a very intractable situation.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know on Friday, Silas and Forrest were
down at one of the universities down in
[SPEAKER_17]: the Bay Area, I think, to see a
neurologist because Silas is back to
[SPEAKER_17]: having grand malls on a fairly regular
basis with all kinds of other types of
[SPEAKER_17]: seizures mixed in.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Forrest is completely overwhelmed by
it all, the whole family is.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what's going on for Colladrius
Network for me personally.
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the problems with state law in
California is local jurisdictions have the
[SPEAKER_17]: authority to limit what the state allows.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the state, for example, in my specific
case allows me to grow six plants for my
[SPEAKER_17]: own personal use, not for anyone else
because I don't have a license.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can't get a license because my local
jurisdiction says my zoning and my
[SPEAKER_17]: property size and my setbacks are all
wrong for any kind of commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: activity.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a problem that California as a
state is trying to make laws that apply in
[SPEAKER_17]: a place like Los Angeles as well as a
place like Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nevada County has almost as much land mass
as LA County, but only 100,000 people.
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the meantime, LA County has like 10
million people.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the rules that work for indoor
cultivation, which is the only real kind
[SPEAKER_17]: of cultivation going on in Los Angeles,
make no sense at all up here in Nevada
[SPEAKER_17]: County or any part of Northern California
for that matter.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, on my property, I can have six
plants, but I can only have them indoors,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is such a huge joke on a
regenerative farm.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that it's possible I could
practice regenerative agriculture indoors.
[SPEAKER_17]: But to do it with six plants is an
insanely expensive and obnoxious hobby,
[SPEAKER_17]: if you will, the environmental impacts of
it for energy usage, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_17]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's funny, here we are, California is
the model, so to speak, for legalization.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yet it's been done so poorly that all
up and down the state, even people who
[SPEAKER_17]: have temporary permits are running into
crazy situations.
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the Dem Family Farms, I won't
mention names, had trouble with,
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was Fish and Game,
Department of Fish and Wildlife came to
[SPEAKER_17]: their farm.
[SPEAKER_17]: And even though the State Water Board and
the CDFA and the local authorities had
[SPEAKER_17]: signed off on their water usage plan,
Fish and Wildlife decided they didn't like
[SPEAKER_17]: their thing and abated their whole
property, took down all their plants,
[SPEAKER_17]: shut them down and filed paperwork with
the state that this particular licensee
[SPEAKER_17]: was in violation of the law.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there, if it goes through the only
administrative things, this farm that was
[SPEAKER_17]: doing so much to try and comply with all
the rules, because one of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_17]: agencies that disagrees with a different
regulatory agency that had already given
[SPEAKER_17]: approval, they are in danger of losing any
opportunity to engage in cannabis activity
[SPEAKER_17]: for three years.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the regulatory agencies can't
agree with each other on what's allowed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So those kind of things are happening in
California and it's really a sad story.
[SPEAKER_17]: The free market, what you were mentioning,
Marcus, about dispensaries and mom and pop
[SPEAKER_17]: operations that have flourished in the
past and have been shut down quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in California, the free market,
the non-regulated market or free market,
[SPEAKER_17]: as I like to call it, is going to flourish
over the next couple of years,
[SPEAKER_17]: because for what it costs, cultivators,
nurserymen, distributors, processors,
[SPEAKER_17]: just on and on, right on through to retail
dispensaries, the price to the consumer is
[SPEAKER_17]: going to be so high that those folks are
going to call up their friends and say,
[SPEAKER_17]: hey, you still helping out?
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's kind of a shame.
[SPEAKER_17]: That we're criminalizing this plant again.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I'm going to stop ranting.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, by the way, Marcus, speaking of
concentrates, I just had a chance to use
[SPEAKER_17]: some of your bags to do some sour diesel
that came out so beautiful, glossy,
[SPEAKER_17]: black, old school hash that is,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Boom, right on, Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't ever worry about your ranting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love your ranting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I could listen to it for hours.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got like a soft, relaxing voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just you got this super,
you got this super good integrity,
[SPEAKER_15]: or I guess after the South Park episode,
we should call it Tegrity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tegrity Farms, available here and there.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys must have seen that episode,
the cannabis growing episode of South
[SPEAKER_15]: Park.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you haven't seen it, please go watch
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of these people have lost their
Tegrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Wade, I wanted to ask you,
you know, you mentioned that January 1st
[SPEAKER_04]: is sort of cut off for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had talked on the phone,
you know, privately about all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you all still allowed to get
contributions from other farms right now
[SPEAKER_04]: until January 1st to be able to maybe
stock on it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're shaking your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to put it out to all
regenerative California growers that are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing high CBD that want to donate to
Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are so in need of product,
really high quality, high CBD product for
[SPEAKER_04]: all of their kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really want to implore all Cali
farmers who are listening to this,
[SPEAKER_04]: that they can donate to Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what I want to do is show a
beautiful CBD crystal, because why not?
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me see if I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of stretched out actually.
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think of them apples?
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think of them apples?
[SPEAKER_15]: That was isolated in Colorado for some
beautiful Colorado hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's monomolecular isolate right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Growing so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we talked about CBD.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a great idea if any of you
guys are down in California and can
[SPEAKER_15]: donate.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty much the best thing you
could ever possibly do is donate to the
[SPEAKER_15]: Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just good people doing good things,
helping children.
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we get?
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of a tricky thing, but you can
contact myself, Wade at HouseOfHarlequin
[SPEAKER_17]: .org or Forest at Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have folks who are already involved
with the network in other parts of
[SPEAKER_17]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can help you network to maybe get it to
one of those folks that might be in your
[SPEAKER_17]: area.
[SPEAKER_17]: The trick is going to be any donations
that we receive between now and the end of
[SPEAKER_17]: the year will be transferred into the
hands of one of the folks who has a permit
[SPEAKER_17]: and license.
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll be able to normalize or bring it
into the regulated marketplace and hold it
[SPEAKER_17]: for the network.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're trying to sort out the details of
how it's going to work from there,
[SPEAKER_17]: but like I said, if we can get it between
now and January 1st, we're allowed to do
[SPEAKER_17]: processing and then formulation and get it
out to the families under state law.
[SPEAKER_17]: After January 1st, it's a little more of a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe somebody could post those websites.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's HouseOfHarlequin.org.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll put them in the comment section of
this video on the YouTube video as well as
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll post it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_15]: Natural Alternatives says that he'll be
getting in touch with you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got a couple of Ringo's gift.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's drying right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_17]: Lawrence Ringo was one of the last crosses
that he was trying to stabilize before he
[SPEAKER_17]: died.
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone that does that know that there are
families that you're making a difference
[SPEAKER_17]: in not just the quality of life,
but even the opportunity for life.
[SPEAKER_17]: In some children's life experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like I'm babbling here a little
bit, but I feel it so deeply and I know
[SPEAKER_17]: some of these families and some of these
kids.
[SPEAKER_17]: It just seems so wrong that a plant that
can do so much good for these kids is
[SPEAKER_17]: under the kind of rules that it still is
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really come true to me, deeply,
deeply true.
[SPEAKER_17]: That the plant in and of itself can do no
harm.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all of the behaviors and the
reactions to prohibition around the plant
[SPEAKER_17]: that have created all the problems.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you break yourself out of North
America, there's still a big world out
[SPEAKER_15]: there where people are still suffering.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to bring up the guy in Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was giving away oil to, I think,
over 700 or 800 people.
[SPEAKER_15]: They finally caught him and they put him
on death row as they do in Malaysia with
[SPEAKER_15]: their zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_15]: The last I actually heard, and this really
shows you the power of the plant,
[SPEAKER_15]: that Malaysia was considering a medical
program based on this guy's story.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to understand, for decades,
all they've done is just hung people.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a total zero tolerance country.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of the reasons when I was in
Thailand and India cruising around
[SPEAKER_15]: Southeast Asia that I refused to go there
when people were like, hey, we're going to
[SPEAKER_15]: go extend our trips.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go get a passport stamp in
Malaysia, come back up to Thailand,
[SPEAKER_15]: stay for a couple more months.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I smoke too much cannabis and cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_15]: I probably have hash stuck on my back
somewhere that I can't see.
[SPEAKER_15]: A big five gram chunk of Nepali finger rub
that I forgot I had.
You wish.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, until I'm at the Malaysian
border, then I absolutely don't wish.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate borders as it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I consider borders to be like prisons.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if you're getting out or
going in when you actually go into a
[SPEAKER_15]: country.
[SPEAKER_15]: It sort of seems like you're going in.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not a big fan of prisons.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can already hear Todd McCormick talking,
hey, I spent five years in prisons and I
[SPEAKER_15]: can promise you there are people that
belong in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: We absolutely need prisons, but not for
habitual florists.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not for habitual florists.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to comment a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, you talking about
corporations, Marcus, we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: incorporated for over 12 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our incorporation, we've been looking
forward to the market possibly opening up
[SPEAKER_04]: and also at the same time, protecting
ourselves as growers and as cultivators
[SPEAKER_04]: that are putting out medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Josh and I started this over 25 years
ago, there was a pact that we had with the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant that we were always going to do good
by the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of growers understand
what I'm talking about because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: like some kind of a safety that comes with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that safety then becomes like a very
small and trusted group of people that you
[SPEAKER_04]: work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden it becomes
legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many of us growers really get the
opportunity to step into understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: what the white market looks like or even
really have the business practices to step
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we do have is we have the
connections.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the connections.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the know-how.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I've been seeing here in
the really large LPs is that there's been
[SPEAKER_04]: billions of dollars made on the market,
but nobody really is growing good flour to
[SPEAKER_04]: put out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like they're not crossing this
bridge with the people who have been part
[SPEAKER_04]: of this industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand how to move it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand how to work with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like a lot of that is being
lost right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's absolutely imperative for us as
activists, for us as dispensary owners,
[SPEAKER_04]: for us as growers to really join together,
which is what I think that this episode is
[SPEAKER_04]: about because I feel like we can really
help each other not only help the LPs get
[SPEAKER_04]: on the right foot, because I would love to
see even these huge big corporations
[SPEAKER_04]: growing really healthy, beautiful flowers
that can be concentrated and given out to
[SPEAKER_04]: people that really need the medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our phone has been ringing off the hook.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been getting 50 emails a day from
people here in Canada who have lost access
[SPEAKER_04]: to their medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the legalization here in Canada,
we are unable, like Marcus was saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: to concentrate this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of kids are not going to be
utilizing flour or a lot of sick people
[SPEAKER_04]: are not going to be utilizing flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't necessarily know how to
concentrate it themselves in a safe
[SPEAKER_04]: manner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like it's up to us as these
small growers and as a small community
[SPEAKER_04]: that entrusted each other before to really
step out, join together so that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: bring medicine to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is our front and foremost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Josh and I have this this corporation
and right now we're in licensure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you, this licensure process
up here in Canada is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is something real.
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount of paperwork that we're going
to have to do is going to set us back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we just got the opportunity,
we just got the ability of what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: licensure that we need to have what we
need to fill out for our licensure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's as if everybody who was not a
part of the, you know, the corporate
[SPEAKER_04]: market and didn't have LPs weren't even
allowed to come into the game at all until
[SPEAKER_04]: the day that it became legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're already behind the ball and the
LPs are not growing anything good and
[SPEAKER_04]: people are losing access.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what happened was on October 17th,
all of the dispensaries that created the
[SPEAKER_11]: culture up here to make medicine for the
people, all the stuff Hillary Black's been
[SPEAKER_11]: doing in life and all the people that have
been having cannabis culture shops in
[SPEAKER_11]: Vancouver and beyond have created a
culture of medicine and the culture of
[SPEAKER_11]: healing people like Wade's talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it caught the idea of the government.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the medicinal qualities, you know,
from the 1800s or thousands of years ago
[SPEAKER_11]: that have come to this point that have
taught us we know it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've created outlaw systems to show
people how it works.
[SPEAKER_11]: The government gets a hold of it and they
basically sever, they sever that original
[SPEAKER_11]: tie.
[SPEAKER_11]: And on October 17th, all of the
dispensaries that were doing all that work
[SPEAKER_11]: have to technically shut their doors or
become outlaws.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's happened here in Nelson,
British Columbia or Vancouver and a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: places that jurisdictions have come
together beyond the law and decided,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know what, we're gonna keep our doors
open until December 31st because that's
[SPEAKER_11]: when these permits run out and local
patients and areas came in to say,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know what, I mean, as much as we're
gaining access in the future, there's
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna be a year or two where there's a
loss of access.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we agree with Marcus and everyone
that says, you know, the Canadian
[SPEAKER_11]: legalization probably is maybe a step in
the right direction towards access to
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the problem is there's this gap in
between because no one recognizes the
[SPEAKER_11]: strains from the LPs.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know them and that's a licensed
producer here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the LPs have to irradiate their weed
to make it safe for the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have irradiated weed going out to
patients that are ill essentially,
[SPEAKER_11]: or maybe they just wanna recreate,
but we still think it's all medicinal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also you can't have concentrates up
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the only thing that's available up here
in Canada at the moment legally is flour
[SPEAKER_11]: and pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those dispensaries that are staying
open are facing 14 years as legislation
[SPEAKER_04]: goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they are real activists and we
as growers here who have brought the
[SPEAKER_04]: market need to do everything that we can
to support them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we need to do everything we can
to support these large corporations and
[SPEAKER_04]: LPs that are stepping into the market that
are going worldwide to teach them how to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow medicine, to teach the plants,
to teach them what kind of strains are
[SPEAKER_04]: helpful for medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that that is the disconnect
right now that we're facing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, agreed, agreed.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a sad situation yet,
yet, man, it's so much better than like
[SPEAKER_15]: having our doors kicked in and just locked
up the way it was the zero tolerance
[SPEAKER_15]: thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand that's not a good reason
to be happy, but it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanna stay positive in the sense
that we have work to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's super clear.
[SPEAKER_15]: We absolutely have work to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the meantime, from like 50 to
60,000 medical patients, being able to
[SPEAKER_15]: grow cannabis to overnight, 30 million
people being able to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: that's something as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that will change the way people think.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to change.
[SPEAKER_15]: We keep talking about governments and LPs.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, LPs and dispensaries,
both sides have your good and have your
[SPEAKER_15]: bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: And unfortunately, it's just like a
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how many five-star restaurants are
there with impeccable quality ingredients
[SPEAKER_15]: versus how many McDonald's are there?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of McDonald's and a lot of
fast food out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the cannabis world, I hear people
complaining all day long about the shitty
[SPEAKER_15]: quality that's available through the LPs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm super spoiled and snobbed out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that about 90% of the
dispensaries, there's like three
[SPEAKER_15]: dispensaries I could name in Vancouver
that I'm like, these guys have it going
[SPEAKER_15]: on.
[SPEAKER_15]: They know how to find proper cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: They know how to grow proper cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: They understand the chemo var of each
strain that they cultivar that they're
[SPEAKER_15]: carrying.
[SPEAKER_15]: They understand a level that brings me
confidence that I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the place right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's literally like probably under
10%.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course for LPs, that's not going to
be any differently.
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep in mind, a lot of people that started
LPs, whether you guys realize this or not,
[SPEAKER_15]: were our peers.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were the people that we were growing
underground with.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were underground growers.
[SPEAKER_15]: The guy who started Aurora was an
underground black market grower.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he did not start Aurora.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure thinking it would be,
you know, this gigantic machine that has
[SPEAKER_15]: like gobbled up like countries of product,
but he was definitely coming from a good
[SPEAKER_15]: place.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was just like one of, I've met the guy
on multiple occasions.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_15]: He loves growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what he loves to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And with LPs, it's the same as
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_15]: 90% of them are producing bunk.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I can't personally go into just
any dispensary and buy great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just can't.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't, you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally agree with you 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that maybe this is a great idea or a
great time maybe to talk to Joshua and
[SPEAKER_11]: just say, you know, part of the thing that
we're creating and Josh has been is,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the science of regenerative
cannabis and to create a whole entire
[SPEAKER_11]: conference that's based solely on
cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's plenty of cannabis events all over
the world, but really they're just sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: catering to what we're taking away from
the nature of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not taking away from the kind
of cannabis that Aurora has turned into or
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not totally true, but a lot of
times, you know, you know, it's the,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's the business aspect of cannabis that
people are talking about on panels.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to give Josh Joshua a
minute here and bless up Roskaya from
[SPEAKER_11]: Pacific Northwest Roots coming in.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk to you in a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to hear from Josh more about
this event that's being plan here in
[SPEAKER_11]: Vancouver, I'd like to get the British
Columbian community and the Canadian
[SPEAKER_11]: community at large really aware of what's
happening here in Vancouver in January so
[SPEAKER_11]: that we can bring up the cultivation
conscious and so we can bring up the
[SPEAKER_11]: quality because part of us creating the
peer certification, Kaia if you can just
[SPEAKER_11]: turn your microphone off.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, part of us creating the
certification is to just get the work done
[SPEAKER_11]: out on how to cultivate it and to share
our successes and failures and also to
[SPEAKER_11]: help Joshua with this event.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hear from you what's happening with
that so that people can really rally
[SPEAKER_11]: around supporting this event and also
learning for their community.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no thanks and thanks again for
having me on Bowman to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The idea of the conference, it just
actually started in December right around
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas time last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me and my buddy Leighton got together and
we had become friends and our friendship
[SPEAKER_10]: had led to this kind of like challenging
of information type of friendship and
[SPEAKER_10]: learning the process and me teaching him
my process and my education process and
[SPEAKER_10]: him teaching me his and with cannabis and
organic cannabis, it has been such a hard
[SPEAKER_10]: learning curve you know and that's why we
started the conferences was to really to
[SPEAKER_10]: bring more education out there because I
was in Washington here I feel like a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of folks that I meet are growing
hydroponically and they're the biggest
[SPEAKER_10]: thing is like yes man that your weed
tastes better, it looks better but I can't
[SPEAKER_10]: sacrifice the yields and I've been like
personally on this hell-bent mission to
[SPEAKER_10]: get those yields that those indoor guys
are getting and grow very high quality
[SPEAKER_10]: weed but it was getting the information
was the challenging part so that's why we
[SPEAKER_10]: started the first conference and we did
one in Portland last year January and
[SPEAKER_10]: three or four people specifically came up
from Humboldt and invited us to come down
[SPEAKER_10]: to Redway and put on another one and so I
had never I've never even been to Humboldt
[SPEAKER_10]: at all until last March when we did this
second conference and I got to meet Rio
[SPEAKER_10]: and Craig and all these folks and they got
to like learn the culture of how folks are
[SPEAKER_10]: really are banding together down there and
it's it's very impressive because in a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of ways you know California has been
growing weed for so long that they're just
[SPEAKER_10]: that much more advanced and seeing how
these smaller guys are banding together is
[SPEAKER_10]: really impressive and so the conference
has just kind of been you know gaining
[SPEAKER_10]: momentum and so this year we reached out
to more folks and said you know if you
[SPEAKER_10]: want us to do these more of these like we
need people to host and so we're doing
[SPEAKER_10]: four conferences this year one in
Vancouver it's gonna be January 11th 12th
[SPEAKER_10]: and 13th we're gonna do one in Redway
again which will be February 21st 22nd and
[SPEAKER_10]: 23rd and then Portland Maine March 1st 2nd
and 3rd and Ann Arbor Michigan March 22nd
[SPEAKER_10]: 23rd and 24th and so that those are kind
of the places we're doing it and you know
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want if folks that are in that
area to hop on our website it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: regenerative organic cannabis.com and yeah
I don't you know what guide me in some
[SPEAKER_10]: questions Josh and Kelly to kind of talk
about so one thing that you know I think
[SPEAKER_11]: is gonna be really useful is to talk about
you know the different aspects of the of
[SPEAKER_11]: the the speakers even like Steve from from
green life and you know being able to talk
[SPEAKER_11]: about indoor cultivation some of the the
the bug families that a predator you can
[SPEAKER_11]: talk you can say that you're gonna
basically be touching on each aspect of
[SPEAKER_11]: the grow and I think that this this this
event really is set apart in the fact that
[SPEAKER_11]: you have an opportunity to really talk to
experts in different parts of the field so
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean how did you come to choosing some
of those people?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah it's so it's my education process
really straight up and then kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: morphing that with Layton and his
connections I don't take any sponsors
[SPEAKER_10]: we're not selling anything that's the big
thing is like I want it to be pure
[SPEAKER_10]: education and so it costs a little bit of
money people have kind of given me a
[SPEAKER_10]: little plaque on that we're charging 125 a
day we're doing discount tickets before
[SPEAKER_10]: December 1st so go go and check out the
website if you guys make it we're doing
[SPEAKER_10]: you know three-day discount and before
December 1st discount but the way we've
[SPEAKER_10]: lined it up Friday is gonna be kind of
like beginning with Dr. Layningham she's
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna come in and talk about the soil food
web who are the players the microorganisms
[SPEAKER_10]: how does it work how how do these
microorganisms transform rocks into
[SPEAKER_10]: nutrients and then we're gonna go into
Layton he'll talk about a bit a bit more
[SPEAKER_10]: about that in the process of how we can
work with compost and then we go into Chip
[SPEAKER_10]: Osborne who he's like he's like a soil
chemistry guy and so he'll come and talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about actually he'll bring out the
periodic chart and talk about all the
[SPEAKER_10]: chemistry components and how we can
achieve the proper balance organically and
[SPEAKER_10]: then we have Josh and let's see I'm trying
to think of the order of the flow then we
[SPEAKER_10]: have Steve Reisner who talks about
aquaponics and then we're gonna go into a
[SPEAKER_10]: Dempure night we did this two nights on
the last two conferences it was really
[SPEAKER_10]: powerful we brought in a panel of four or
five Dempure certified farmers and just
[SPEAKER_10]: had a discussion about practices you know
and walked through each farmer how do you
[SPEAKER_10]: achieve this how do you achieve nutrient
management how do you achieve you know IPM
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was really powerful just to connect
with peers you know and then the next day
[SPEAKER_10]: we kind of flipped Saturday and to go into
a more of a tools-based system so we open
[SPEAKER_10]: up with Chris Trump who does Korean
natural farming and he's gonna do a good
[SPEAKER_10]: two-hour session and talk about that and
how you know those are those you do know
[SPEAKER_10]: what Korean natural farming is it's really
a nutrient management tool set and you
[SPEAKER_10]: make all these concoctions and brews that
you can manage nutrients throughout the
[SPEAKER_10]: life cycle of the plant so he has a he has
a pretty good presentation in Korean
[SPEAKER_10]: natural farming it's all about how to
produce those products off your own land
[SPEAKER_10]: with buying very little his big claim to
fame is he ran an 800 acre macadamia nut
[SPEAKER_10]: farm in Hawaii and he was able to manage
the nutrient load with $500 an acre KNF
[SPEAKER_10]: inputs which is mind-boggling you know
it's very cheap so so I have a question
[SPEAKER_15]: yeah is this something that you will post
afterwards like video footage of somewhere
[SPEAKER_10]: you know we're not we will part part of it
so that's a that's a very good question we
[SPEAKER_11]: cannot help in Vancouver with that if you
knew yeah so we're not gonna post the
[SPEAKER_10]: speakers and it's mostly because a lot of
the speakers want freedom to say things
[SPEAKER_10]: that people who run companies that sell
products might not want them to say and
[SPEAKER_10]: specifically the lady who was gonna speak
next on Saturday Suzanne Wainwright she's
[SPEAKER_10]: a beneficial insect specialist and people
don't like to hear you know that sell
[SPEAKER_10]: bottled products pesticides they don't
like her message and she is she brings a
[SPEAKER_10]: really strong and bold message and so she
doesn't want to be recorded so we're gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: honor that with the speakers but we are
going to record the the evening sessions
[SPEAKER_10]: we're gonna do a growers panel on Friday
night a Dempure panel on Saturday night
[SPEAKER_10]: and then all day Sunday is gonna be a
genetics day so we're kind of like have
[SPEAKER_10]: these broken up into you know you know
here's how the biology works here's the
[SPEAKER_10]: tools how to do plant nutrients and
beneficial insect IPM and then the third
[SPEAKER_10]: day is all genetics and Kevin Jodry from
Wonderland nursery down in Humboldt is
[SPEAKER_10]: organizing that and I don't know folks
have seen he threw a post out to call out
[SPEAKER_10]: breeders and we're gonna do breeders
panels that day as well those will be
[SPEAKER_11]: recorded and we're gonna put all that on
YouTube so we also really like to have our
[SPEAKER_11]: talks and presentations recorded even
though we feel we are saying bold things
[SPEAKER_11]: we think that how's the time that bold
things yes Craig you know we think that
[SPEAKER_11]: this is the time to be bold and we have a
nutrient company but yet we our whole
[SPEAKER_11]: entire teaching is to tell people to go
beyond that so you know huge respect to
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone and their path and stuff but this
is what we think is powerful and so I
[SPEAKER_11]: think we're gonna probably have our talk
recorded and we'll talk to you and the
[SPEAKER_11]: rest of the group about that and have that
out and we always try to do that we think
[SPEAKER_11]: it's really important and yeah I just want
to say one more time like maybe Marcus can
[SPEAKER_11]: put post the the link to this event and I
think that people can spend $125 a day and
[SPEAKER_11]: feel incredibly good about it because
you're spending thousands of dollars to
[SPEAKER_11]: correct your mistakes and if you can align
yourself with correct information you're
[SPEAKER_11]: only gonna benefit yourself so let's have
everyone take a look at that that website
[SPEAKER_11]: in the link and thanks a lot Josh for
putting that together and we want to move
[SPEAKER_04]: over to Ross Kaya so what's going on in
Washington and your end and it's nice to
[SPEAKER_04]: see you this morning and we know that
you're making headways and just want to
[SPEAKER_04]: hear about your successes and things that
have been really challenging in the
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington market these days for you first
can you hear me yeah okay good it's the
[SPEAKER_14]: way my second time doing this kind of
format so I'm rusty good morning everybody
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington State is crazy right now it
took a while to get into the rec market
[SPEAKER_14]: and I want to say we started about 18
months ago designing this really
[SPEAKER_14]: incredible massive indoor facility and
we're able to do some things there that
[SPEAKER_14]: nobody else was really focusing on
especially regarding our hash production
[SPEAKER_14]: so you know building out a large-scale
water hash space shout out fresh headies I
[SPEAKER_14]: was on there a long time ago soaking up
all the all the tidbits and knowledge and
[SPEAKER_14]: you know my first set of bags with the
bubble man bags and good friends with with
[SPEAKER_14]: oil slicks he's he's talked about you and
I connecting for a long time and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_14]: have to come north of the border it sounds
like so come up and visit did he tell you
[SPEAKER_15]: our story of how we met no no he met me at
my gallery the melting point that I had
[SPEAKER_15]: back in 2003 in Vancouver he rolled by and
I had this tape this long countertop
[SPEAKER_15]: called the inhalation station of
vaporization and I had like 10 different
[SPEAKER_15]: vaporizers on the counter I brought all of
these vaporizers to Canada for the first
[SPEAKER_15]: time like the arrow med which was built
and designed by cancer patients out of
[SPEAKER_15]: Germany the volcano I met Marcus and his
daughter years ago in Dortmund Germany at
[SPEAKER_15]: a cannabis show in the in the 90s and so I
brought I had all of these vaporizers and
[SPEAKER_15]: he came in and right away we kind of
connected and I pulled out some full melt
[SPEAKER_15]: and of course you know one of my favorite
mentors who's in the room right now skunk
[SPEAKER_15]: man Sam who's a huge inspiration to me in
the way that I looked at cannabis and
[SPEAKER_15]: looked at resin and learned about getting
the resin off of the plant and only really
[SPEAKER_15]: smoking you know for for almost 20 years
now I've just smoked hash whether it's
[SPEAKER_15]: being vaporized off cannabis flowers or
you know smoked as rosin dry sifter bubble
[SPEAKER_15]: and so Sam always smoked back in the day
with matches in fact at the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_15]: you could follow around the little pile of
screens perfect stainless steel screens
[SPEAKER_15]: and the matches because he'd like hit a
bowl and then throw the screen out after
[SPEAKER_15]: he hit a bowl and put a new new screen in
for a fresh new rip and although it was
[SPEAKER_15]: ridiculous I have to say it was like it
was it was it was so amazing to hit a
[SPEAKER_15]: fresh screen each time you had a bowl
anyway to get to how I met oil slick I was
[SPEAKER_15]: smoking with matches well he took he used
nine matches to get his hit a full
[SPEAKER_15]: meltdown he just kept like it was like he
was blowing it out without blowing it out
[SPEAKER_15]: it was quite funny so when he came back
into my life years later and he was like
[SPEAKER_15]: oh I met you at the melting point do you
remember me do you remember me I had the
[SPEAKER_15]: mustache I had this I had that I'm like I
don't remember you and then he's like okay
[SPEAKER_15]: dude I was the guy that took nine matches
to burn a single bowl of full mouth and I
[SPEAKER_15]: was like oh my god dude I remember you
completely yeah so shout out dude it made
[SPEAKER_15]: me smile when you came in and said you
were gonna do like some large-scale water
[SPEAKER_15]: extraction we're gonna have to we'll have
to talk after the show sounds good sounds
[SPEAKER_14]: good so yeah that was that's kind of where
where things kicked off I had met these
[SPEAKER_14]: guys two years ago and they invited me up
to help with this project so 18 year 18
[SPEAKER_14]: months in the making and we dropped our
first hash I don't know three four months
[SPEAKER_14]: ago and really changed changed a lot of
things about the recreational hash game in
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington you know the people wanted it
but the producers and processors just
[SPEAKER_14]: weren't providing it the models that are
set up here it's really hard to make any
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of money and so once you get into
that environment there's a lot of corner
[SPEAKER_14]: cutting and it's just it's just kind of a
weird space to operate in and you know
[SPEAKER_14]: when when I had pitched this this business
model a lot of people said hey you can't
[SPEAKER_14]: do that you're you're out of your mind the
top dollar and hash right now wholesale is
[SPEAKER_14]: like 20 bucks you know so for your your
best hash that you're making you're only
[SPEAKER_14]: gonna get $20 a gram for it and we we
actually were getting $30 a gram for our
[SPEAKER_14]: highest grade wholesale and just bumped
the market up and people are coming in and
[SPEAKER_14]: picking it up and then coming back and
buying out the store it's just it's just a
[SPEAKER_14]: rare product people aren't aren't thinking
about where this leads so I started in the
[SPEAKER_14]: weed game in 96 at Western Washington
University just a you know hop skip and a
[SPEAKER_14]: jump from the Canadian border so I was up
in in Vancouver all the time Blunt
[SPEAKER_14]: Brothers you know what the first was
popping off up there and then we were up
[SPEAKER_14]: there all the time and getting searched
every time we came back across the border
[SPEAKER_14]: you know how's Mark how's Mark which one
you guys is the master grower you know
[SPEAKER_14]: they find a magazine and then you know
hold you there for three four hours and
[SPEAKER_14]: and we'd fuck with them back you know we
blaze right up to the border and throw
[SPEAKER_14]: everything out you know knowing they were
gonna mess with us but you know we figure
[SPEAKER_14]: we're gonna be stoned while we while we're
detained anyway so that was always fun
[SPEAKER_14]: it's crazy to see how far it's come and
you know you were talking about earlier
[SPEAKER_14]: Marcus about and I'm just kind of all over
the place right now but nervous you were
[SPEAKER_14]: talking about how things have changed
right so we're in the black market days
[SPEAKER_14]: and we saw the stuff coming from Canada we
never saw California weed in Washington
[SPEAKER_14]: just it just never came up and then after
9-eleven they shut that border down a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: of my Canadian friends actually moved down
here and sort of buying up neighborhoods
[SPEAKER_14]: and doing indoor grows and you know things
have just kind of changed and then with
[SPEAKER_14]: the advent of medical in 2010 in
Washington the first brick-and-mortars
[SPEAKER_14]: went up and there was like four of them
and the one closest to me had they've
[SPEAKER_14]: gotten waited and I went out I didn't know
the guys I went out and I bailed them out
[SPEAKER_14]: and said hey let me let me help you with
your shop and that kind of got me going
[SPEAKER_14]: into the medical so this is to me this is
like the third iteration of a market when
[SPEAKER_14]: it goes to recreational so we've seen this
this over and over again we know where
[SPEAKER_14]: it's gonna go right so when the when the
medical opened up in Washington a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: that Canadian herb or California herb came
up and we've never seen it before and the
[SPEAKER_14]: patients a lot of them were new patients
they've never seen it before so they
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't understand even you know that this
was like not the highest grade herbs so
[SPEAKER_14]: they bought that for a year or two and
then after about two years of that you you
[SPEAKER_14]: couldn't you couldn't push it it didn't
have the same value they wanted the local
[SPEAKER_14]: weed that was you know clearly a higher
grade and then the hash came right and you
[SPEAKER_14]: saw this push of BHO and nobody even
wanted to buy bubble hash anymore I mean I
[SPEAKER_14]: had stores tell me BHOs killed bubble hash
I wouldn't give you ten dollars for your
[SPEAKER_14]: you know what would now cost six star
there was no star system back then they
[SPEAKER_14]: killed nothing yeah they killed nothing
now they're you know they want to pay me
[SPEAKER_14]: more than ever for it but you know we can
see these cycles so when you come into
[SPEAKER_14]: this rec market in Washington you can see
that same cycle repeating itself
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody's on BHO that's produced a lot
cheaper I think the average wholesale
[SPEAKER_14]: prices for BHO in Washington state are
like I don't know six to twelve bucks you
[SPEAKER_14]: know whereas we were getting thirty for
the six star so you know huge difference
[SPEAKER_14]: the people want it the system doesn't
necessarily want it because the system
[SPEAKER_14]: wants to reward high production that kind
of stuff and that's just you know the way
[SPEAKER_14]: that it's set up they're overtaxing it and
you know we see the same mistakes playing
[SPEAKER_14]: out in a lot of different markets so it's
it's kind of in a weird spot here in
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington but you know we know where
where the people want to go that are
[SPEAKER_14]: consuming and we know where the people
want to go that are trying to you know
[SPEAKER_14]: make a living off of this and it's really
tough for for grassroots guys especially
[SPEAKER_14]: in Washington state I don't know the laws
and other places but in Washington state I
[SPEAKER_14]: couldn't bring any of my own money into
this because it was black market money so
[SPEAKER_14]: you're almost forced to partner with
somebody and that doesn't always work out
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's it's really tough we can get into
that a little more later you know my my
[SPEAKER_14]: current situation is it's kind of up in
the air right now so I don't know that
[SPEAKER_14]: it's gonna work out most likely not but
that'll lead to something else another
[SPEAKER_15]: door opening up and we'll go there exactly
if it doesn't work out it will work out
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah just stick with your heart stick with
your heart you'll it'll lead you your
[SPEAKER_11]: family it'll lead you in the right
direction you have the quality and
[SPEAKER_11]: everything and maybe maybe you could tell
us just a quick little bit about your
[SPEAKER_11]: genetics because a lot of people have been
including ourselves you know super
[SPEAKER_11]: impressed a with the coffee and the whole
alien vibe that's going on there like it
[SPEAKER_11]: worked really good outdoors up here in
British Columbia it was really wonderful I
[SPEAKER_11]: mean it was like that but it was a
phenomenal flavor so maybe you can tell us
[SPEAKER_11]: a little bit about worldwide roots
genetics and then we'll hear from a couple
[SPEAKER_11]: other people Mark Skunkman and Craig who
came on awesome yeah those those those
[SPEAKER_14]: plants really do work out well we've had
them grown I've got a lot of good my wife
[SPEAKER_14]: is from Big Island so a lot of folks are
growing coffee out on the island and it
[SPEAKER_14]: worked well in those climates it's a very
versatile plant I got into breeding there
[SPEAKER_14]: was an old-timer on the forums lemonhoco
shout out lemonhoco he holds a really
[SPEAKER_14]: incredible blueberry and he's bred some
really fun stuff with Cam and anyways my
[SPEAKER_14]: dad was a he bred chickens and hounds and
I was in a session with Mel and he said
[SPEAKER_14]: you know you should be breeding you've got
great genetics you should be breeding
[SPEAKER_14]: these and I'm like I don't know and so he
talked me into it kind of dragged me into
[SPEAKER_14]: it really and I got hooked I mean I got
hooked lying and sinkered I had changed up
[SPEAKER_14]: my whole room on how I test things and you
know I always thought it was really kind
[SPEAKER_14]: of shady when you go to buy seeds online
and you'd see one picture of one plant and
[SPEAKER_14]: you're like oh that's beautiful I'm gonna
I'm gonna get those seeds and that's what
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna get and then you get them and if
that's wasn't what it was and I think you
[SPEAKER_14]: know that the market has evolved people's
understanding has evolved people want to
[SPEAKER_14]: use different kinds of seeds to grow
different kinds of crops you know if
[SPEAKER_14]: you're gorilla grower you might want you
know feminized stuff where you don't have
[SPEAKER_14]: to come out and check for sex if you're
growing indoor and you're just trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: find a mop so you know people are growing
for different reasons and we're kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: having a better understanding of what
these different kind of seeds give us you
[SPEAKER_14]: know if you're a breeder you might want to
be X something for for you know selecting
[SPEAKER_14]: for a male to breed so I just I just kind
of got into it that way and at the time
[SPEAKER_14]: that I had gotten started Mel had given me
some seeds that had the alien genetic in
[SPEAKER_14]: it the alien tech and I found some good
stuff in there and started playing with it
[SPEAKER_14]: and you know Kai's coffee won its first
high times cup well it didn't win it it
[SPEAKER_14]: was like third place in Seattle in 2014 I
think but it was the highest tested strain
[SPEAKER_14]: so super powerful and it really had this
great narcotic effect and it dumps hash it
[SPEAKER_14]: it dumps hash crazy amounts of hash huge
huge returns 26 percent 30 percent on
[SPEAKER_14]: flowers when you're pressing just the
flowers and when you're washing it you get
[SPEAKER_15]: great great yields as well so what's the
difference between the washing and
[SPEAKER_15]: pressing yields like if you're getting 25
to 26 percent out of pressing what where
[SPEAKER_15]: would you sit around for extracting with
with water hash fresh frozen on the coffee
[SPEAKER_13]: probably close to five percent five
percent return but that's fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_14]: fresh frozen full plant fresh frozen yeah
yeah so I generally you know if it's a you
[SPEAKER_14]: can do a little bit of a conversion so we
would say that would might be like a
[SPEAKER_14]: twenty percent if you if you were washing
dried flowers you might get twenty percent
[SPEAKER_14]: back on that right yeah it's interesting
it's a dumper and I always I'm always
[SPEAKER_15]: interested in the different yields from
oil to water hash and anyone can correct
[SPEAKER_15]: me if I'm wrong but my theory is is that
and I've recently posted a photo on
[SPEAKER_15]: Instagram that shows this fairly
powerfully like what material looks like
[SPEAKER_15]: after I wash it I'm not sure if anyone saw
that in fact why wouldn't I just show it
[SPEAKER_15]: right now because I'm not gonna send
everyone to my Instagram account right so
[SPEAKER_15]: I posted this picture it's basically
material that I've washed it's been washed
[SPEAKER_15]: and I show that I've been efficient at
getting the heads off so there's the photo
[SPEAKER_15]: right there so that's those are basically
all of the capitate stocked and all of the
[SPEAKER_15]: Cecil stocked not all of them but I'd say
90 plus percent maybe 95 percent in this
[SPEAKER_15]: particular instance it looks like it's a
hundred percent except you can see one
[SPEAKER_15]: little amber tripe there in the in the
right of the of the leaf but what I've
[SPEAKER_15]: noticed is that the difference between
your yields from bubble hash to oil for me
[SPEAKER_15]: at least because I know my efficiency
because I checked with a microscope of
[SPEAKER_15]: extraction is that when you run it through
a plant fat extraction or a solvent
[SPEAKER_15]: extraction or a rosin press or whatever
and you get that rest of that oil out it
[SPEAKER_15]: seems to come from the third type of
trichome the bulbous the one that sits on
[SPEAKER_15]: a single-stipe cell the one that doesn't
easily break off through mechanical screen
[SPEAKER_15]: separations or water extractions and so
I'm always interested if that's the case
[SPEAKER_15]: you know to know what the percentage you
know bright you just mentioned it was
[SPEAKER_15]: potentially six percent of the yields is
sitting in those bulbous trichomes and
[SPEAKER_15]: that's also a unique way to be able to
separate them out when you press them into
[SPEAKER_15]: rosin and I always said this to the oil
guys that I inevitably we were I guess
[SPEAKER_15]: back in the day it was almost like
argument arguing because I was the water
[SPEAKER_15]: hash guy and they were the BHO guys and so
they would be saying like oh yeah we you
[SPEAKER_15]: know we get a way nicer product and I'm
like yeah but you know like maybe it would
[SPEAKER_15]: be nicer if you actually isolated your
glands first and then made oil with that
[SPEAKER_15]: you know rather than taking because for me
I was never a fan at least for inhaling or
[SPEAKER_15]: vaporizing or smoking bulbous heads like
extracting just bulbous heads out which
[SPEAKER_15]: you can do by running some water hash and
then taking that material and doing an oil
[SPEAKER_15]: extraction or a rosin press or a fat plait
extraction press or you can find out what
[SPEAKER_15]: your ratio is of how much resin now of
course if you were inefficient in your
[SPEAKER_15]: mixing this would be altered in your data
because if you weren't extracting all of
[SPEAKER_15]: the glandular trichome heads from the
capitate and the sessiles then obviously
[SPEAKER_15]: the data would be no good but from what
I've seen it's anywhere between six and
[SPEAKER_15]: fifteen percent the differences between
how much those bulbous heads can weigh
[SPEAKER_15]: because some plants that I photograph it's
they're literally on every leaf like every
[SPEAKER_15]: fan leaf just has bulbous heads stuck all
along and they're very very small you
[SPEAKER_15]: don't really see them with the naked eye
the same way you see the little ones that
[SPEAKER_15]: the capitate stalks and the capitate
sessiles that stand up tall so yes the
[SPEAKER_06]: materials fresh frozen then it's hard to
by weight compare that to dry sift or
[SPEAKER_06]: yields or even pho yields depending on
what the material that you started with is
[SPEAKER_15]: yeah I mean unless you can do you know
I've always divided by either four or five
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen most material come out in a
division of four but there is some that
[SPEAKER_15]: happens to divide by five meaning when I
you know dry a hundred grams of it I get
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 grams instead of 25 grams do you feel
that the fresh frozen has any
[SPEAKER_06]: extra-intensive moisture inside the resin
head yeah absolutely I think that it's
[SPEAKER_15]: it's just like dry sift trying to wet wash
with you know sift that still has moisture
[SPEAKER_15]: content in the in the in the wax membrane
of the head it's when I use fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_15]: it's and the terpene content is much
higher too which tends to sort of butter
[SPEAKER_15]: out the resin sometimes depending on what
terpenes are there but yeah I've
[SPEAKER_15]: definitely seen that that that has been
seen by me for sure I agree we'll bring
[SPEAKER_11]: some coffee over for you to play around
with Marcus how do you like that one dude
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it I want to check out the coffee I
don't even drink coffee but there is a
[SPEAKER_15]: reggae artist named coffee who has a track
with chronics right now on the BBC live
[SPEAKER_15]: which is straight fire I hope to go to
Jamaica next month actually as well as
[SPEAKER_15]: Columbia got a little bit of an embarked
trip coming up and hopefully I'll be able
[SPEAKER_15]: to do some filming while I'm down in those
two countries should be exciting hey some
[SPEAKER_15]: people donated while we were chatting I
think it was about 65 bucks here so I'll
[SPEAKER_15]: send that off to the Caladrius network for
for them to disperse of how they see fit
[SPEAKER_04]: that's awesome and hey Craig from
Alpenglow just joined us on here and Craig
[SPEAKER_04]: you're in the Sohum area tell us a little
bit about your farm and we know that you
[SPEAKER_11]: are really one of the farms that are just
you know really getting out there I'll
[SPEAKER_11]: just getting a lot of really getting a lot
of information a lot of different levels
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it's you know the the TV or
different edible companies and we would
[SPEAKER_11]: love for you to share with us yeah some of
the ways that you're keeping your your
[SPEAKER_11]: business and your farm viable in this
future and some of the unique things that
[SPEAKER_11]: you you find yourself coming across and by
the way we love and appreciate you and
[SPEAKER_15]: your family man I love the timing of that
I'm so glad nobody spoke because right as
[SPEAKER_15]: you finished you know Sam hit his bong his
Swiss perk if I heard correctly and just
[SPEAKER_15]: it's put the camera right on the little
microphone off dude that was awesome nice
[SPEAKER_04]: one we appreciate that thanks for that
thank you makes me want to go get my bong
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah we couldn't hear you your microphone
wasn't on unmute can you you with us no
[SPEAKER_11]: can you unmute his mic your phone Marcus
by any chance
[SPEAKER_04]: and Marcus we actually can't hear you
either oh cuz I got my mic muted I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: typing all the time and I don't want to be
doing too much of that so that's cool well
[SPEAKER_11]: if if Craig can get unmuted well if if he
puts his mouse on this on the top of the
[SPEAKER_15]: like where I am right now and yes it then
the bar on top will open with the phone
[SPEAKER_15]: and the cog and the Wi-Fi and the camera
microphone and the person symbol and he
[SPEAKER_15]: can just go into the microphone symbol and
click that and that will unmute it it's
[SPEAKER_15]: always nice to let people know how to do
these things it's sometimes difficult
[SPEAKER_15]: hopefully it works out for him I was the
one that muted his mic when he came in
[SPEAKER_15]: because he was moving his screen and
someone was talking but these are the
[SPEAKER_15]: technical difficulties we deal with on a
daily basis here on hash church it happens
[SPEAKER_11]: so maybe we'll just move over I had a
quick question for and that's my how you
[SPEAKER_11]: know mark mark scale down what what's
happening with you and your neck of the
[SPEAKER_11]: woods let's hear something from from your
your wonderfulness sorry about all the
[SPEAKER_02]: noise I'm waiting for a flight in
Philadelphia a lot of noise here probably
[SPEAKER_02]: it probably doesn't sound very good but
can you hear me we can hear you and all
[SPEAKER_15]: the noise it's okay are you coming back
from fish or something no I'm actually I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: heading up to a company called the send
wellness is working on a project called
[SPEAKER_02]: grow mass which is a very large production
facility in the middle of Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_02]: heading up for the first time to see the
facility in the building it was an old
[SPEAKER_02]: machine factory or they used to make drill
bits and drill presses and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_02]: so they're conferring an old factory a
rundown factory in a New England town that
[SPEAKER_02]: probably felt the economic depression of a
business going away to you know putting a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis operation in there so this is a
company called the send wellness it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple licenses in multiple states but
this is their project going in
[SPEAKER_15]: Massachusetts awesome very cool I think I
know a send wellness yeah they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple different operations I think you
can Google them I think they actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: a website so yeah I mean that's why I'm
always interested in markets when I see
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of you working on the whole scale
up issue that you were talking earlier I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean a lot of things work on small artisan
scale but you really find out how scalable
[SPEAKER_02]: these things are when you go to make
several hundred kilos or a thousand kilos
[SPEAKER_02]: of material is different than making a few
kilos or a couple grams right yes correct
[SPEAKER_15]: that is that is what I'm in the middle of
dealing with right now with my new company
[SPEAKER_15]: embark there the whole the whole process
is basically scalability and taking you
[SPEAKER_15]: know things like ultrasonic cryojet cryo
ethanol to co2 to large-scale industrial
[SPEAKER_15]: commercialized water extraction that's GMP
compliant and terpene extraction hydrovac
[SPEAKER_15]: distillation steam vac distillation all of
these different components rosin working
[SPEAKER_15]: with pure pressure so we're definitely
looking at the scale of this the
[SPEAKER_15]: scalability issue in each of those
components that will allow us to not
[SPEAKER_15]: sacrifice the quality itself that being
said you know there's only so much quality
[SPEAKER_15]: that I really think that one of our
biggest steps that we need to take in this
[SPEAKER_15]: whole because everyone preaches the whole
like oh we got a you know you got a
[SPEAKER_15]: boycott the LPs and buy from from the from
the micro farmer and stuff it's like
[SPEAKER_15]: listen I support that I just want everyone
to be like on the same I lost trust in
[SPEAKER_15]: people a long time ago when they started
especially here in BC where people were
[SPEAKER_15]: just spraying you know avid and and
defenders sulfur products that could never
[SPEAKER_15]: be removed from the product all sorts of
different foliar sprays in bloom like
[SPEAKER_15]: people were were doing it not good and not
safe and you can see it in the end product
[SPEAKER_15]: where it looked it might have looked nice
but there was something off about it there
[SPEAKER_15]: was something wrong about it and I just
like the idea when I go to a kitchen to
[SPEAKER_15]: know that they follow simple food safety
regulations you know what I mean and I
[SPEAKER_15]: don't want cannabis to be treated like
plutonium and be be that difficult but it
[SPEAKER_15]: should have just a few small regulations
definitely the packaging and all that
[SPEAKER_15]: protect the children bullshit is out the
window because you definitely don't need
[SPEAKER_15]: to protect children from cannabis the
worst side effect would be ordering a
[SPEAKER_15]: pizza and so I think that you don't need
to protect children from cannabis you
[SPEAKER_15]: should protect them from things like
fentanyl and pharmaceutical drugs and
[SPEAKER_15]: alcohol that's pretty much in most
people's homes but not necessarily
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis but at the same time regulate it
to the point where I don't trust
[SPEAKER_15]: motherfuckers you know I just don't not
with my lungs of something that I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: breathing all the time I've been to enough
Jamaican farms with like super righteous
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamaican Rastas that are just like awesome
dudes and then I do a little walk around
[SPEAKER_15]: around the perimeter of the property and
then I find the bottle that they used of
[SPEAKER_15]: these fungicides or herbicides or like
basically toxic poisons that aren't even
[SPEAKER_15]: allowed in North America we're just like
send that shit to the Caribbean they don't
[SPEAKER_15]: just like dispose of it they still sell it
to countries that don't have these rules
[SPEAKER_15]: and regulations and so then I see it and
I'm like man like I can't I can't do that
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't work with material like that and I
think that the one good thing that I
[SPEAKER_15]: personally like about the regulations is
catching people doing that that's
[SPEAKER_15]: important catching people doing that
testing for that shit so that we know when
[SPEAKER_15]: we're inhaling it and everyone also just
claims to be for the patients that's not
[SPEAKER_15]: true I wish it was but it's just not true
we got to be honest with ourselves here
[SPEAKER_15]: like not everyone out there is for the
patients a whole fuckload of people are
[SPEAKER_04]: for the prohibition based dollar and
that's how many people you know learned
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation methods with a lot of those
toxins and they don't understand how not
[SPEAKER_04]: to use them I know that there is a
tremendous amount of you know people that
[SPEAKER_04]: have just been using those toxins and and
haven't further their education and that's
[SPEAKER_04]: where you know Joshua you come in with
this education platform that you're having
[SPEAKER_04]: for a lot of people and joining together
with small farmers we have the ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: educate not educate not only educate
farmers but also educate consumers that
[SPEAKER_04]: this sort of thing is happening in
cultivation and that they need to demand
[SPEAKER_04]: at their dispensaries and at the places
that they purchase these products you know
[SPEAKER_04]: where does this come from and what kind of
integrity was it grown with Craig are you
[SPEAKER_04]: available Craig are you are you ready to
talk from up and glow did you say
[SPEAKER_15]: integrity I just love hanging out with all
of you guys some new faces some old faces
[SPEAKER_11]: it's talking about something interesting
maybe Steve you could tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: about your concentrate experience there in
Nevada I think people might be interested
[SPEAKER_11]: to know what you're doing also I would
love to hear from you about your jars and
[SPEAKER_11]: your packaging for your for your buds and
and and stuff that you do and that's part
[SPEAKER_11]: of your peer certification is one of your
closed loops as you redo your jars and
[SPEAKER_11]: that's a problem here in Canada is just
creating all this medicine and then we
[SPEAKER_11]: have to surround it in garbage in order to
get it to people so basically it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: all of our weed has to have a percentage
of landfill attached to it in order for it
[SPEAKER_11]: to be like okay for the public so Steve
can you tell us a bit about your situation
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah so here in Nevada as far as
extractions go I personally don't have a
[SPEAKER_12]: license for GLP to extract yet but if you
work with evergreen organics and I am
[SPEAKER_12]: aware of their situation what they have to
do as far as extractions go and it's
[SPEAKER_12]: tested it's always clean most everybody
these days uses distillate and basically
[SPEAKER_12]: brings it down to nothing but for the most
part as far as our packaging program our
[SPEAKER_12]: jar recycling program yeah it's kicked off
it's been really cool it's it's not only a
[SPEAKER_12]: way to recycle our jars back into
production but it just kind of distills
[SPEAKER_12]: this recycling mindset in our consumers so
that they they save these jars and maybe
[SPEAKER_12]: use them with other flour or or other
purposes some people show us send us
[SPEAKER_12]: pictures of them making candles out of
them and and putting coins in them and
[SPEAKER_12]: just doing all kinds of crazy things with
them and it's still you know a way to
[SPEAKER_12]: recycle it but we offer a program where we
do pop-ups at local dispensaries where it
[SPEAKER_12]: gets us not the opportunity to kind of
educate the patients on on our strains on
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes on just different chemo bars and
how they affect you and at the same time
[SPEAKER_12]: we offer a jar return program where the
patients could bring various numbers of
[SPEAKER_12]: jars in and depending on how many jars
they bring back there's certain things
[SPEAKER_12]: that we offer from a pre-roll to a hat to
shirts things like that so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: like a way to market build a connection
with our with our patients spread that the
[SPEAKER_12]: the recycling vibe I guess if you will
mindset it's just something cool that we
[SPEAKER_12]: can give back and it's it's dem pure
certifiable so it's one of the things I
[SPEAKER_12]: recommend most people should look into
packaging in the regulated market gets
[SPEAKER_12]: expensive last thing I personally don't
like buying flour in plastic bags that
[SPEAKER_12]: dries out no matter how long it sits on
the shelf so I definitely prefer good
[SPEAKER_12]: packaging so this is just one way that
we're able to offer quality packaging
[SPEAKER_12]: without really exploiting and building
these landfills and and building carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: footprint also Steve you know we've been
seeing you all out there I mean your
[SPEAKER_04]: company is really out there and we're
seeing you all over the place and really
[SPEAKER_04]: educating both farmers and consumers and I
and I really want to commend you guys for
[SPEAKER_04]: that and I also want to talk about you
know you've been really busting the myth
[SPEAKER_04]: on healthy indoor your facility I would
love to hear a little bit about how you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys are really the leader in indoor
cultivation living soil and you're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: tremendous yields and incredible health I
know that in Nevada deals with really
[SPEAKER_04]: strict testing and and I would just love
to hear a little bit more about and how
[SPEAKER_11]: you've kept your soil healthy over you
know 14 cycles now 14 everyone 14 cycles
[SPEAKER_04]: or to my production has been running and
it's phenomenal yeah you know I mean we're
[SPEAKER_12]: always evolving we're always adding in and
changing things as you know depending on
[SPEAKER_12]: what the plans tell us depending on what
soil reports tell us but for the most part
[SPEAKER_12]: we're just always trying to minimize our
inputs and always trying to maximize the
[SPEAKER_12]: outputs we're very successful just in the
team I've built around me I have a very
[SPEAKER_12]: passionate team that that's very dedicated
to what they do and they do a really good
[SPEAKER_12]: job without them I mean I'd be a mess but
for the most part yeah it's just basically
[SPEAKER_12]: simplifying it but luckily the regulations
have changed a little bit so now we can
[SPEAKER_12]: entertain things like more of the Korean
natural farming techniques on where before
[SPEAKER_12]: it was a little bit more stringent with
the testing so as you and Josh know I
[SPEAKER_12]: couldn't play with a lot of the foliars on
the microbial foliars and things like that
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only apply things to the soil I had
to be very conscious about our environment
[SPEAKER_12]: overall like a lot of people like to use
the on the the DVD charts and run this
[SPEAKER_12]: high high humidity indoors trying to get
these maximum meals but I'm sorry you will
[SPEAKER_12]: not pass a state test I'm running those
humidity levels on indoor flower in a
[SPEAKER_12]: regulated state so we've had this learning
curve and we've dabbled with a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: of everything and it's been fun and you
guys have been there with me the whole
[SPEAKER_12]: time you know to help me and yeah every
time we have an incident we always keep
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys informed recently had a bulb
actually explode and almost burned a whole
[SPEAKER_12]: room down I definitely ruined a whole room
but that's one thing I definitely informed
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys about so you guys can definitely
let them pure farmers know that this HID
[SPEAKER_12]: bulbs definitely have some issues you've
got to be careful using them and how we
[SPEAKER_12]: you know build these rooms when using this
type of technology but anyways beyond that
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah this has been hard it's been working
but yeah indoor cultivation in some states
[SPEAKER_12]: is definitely a good thing some in some
states is definitely silly but yeah here
[SPEAKER_12]: in Nevada we make it work yeah I've been
blessed crop loss is a real thing when you
[SPEAKER_15]: farm you know that's just that's just a
fact whatever you farm if you farm
[SPEAKER_15]: something crop loss is gonna be a
possibility and it always kind of made me
[SPEAKER_15]: laugh when I looked at all these sort of
business proposals for these LPs in Canada
[SPEAKER_15]: none of them in any of their decks had had
crop loss as a as as you know something
[SPEAKER_15]: that can happen it just wasn't a part of
their deck they had all these great
[SPEAKER_15]: numbers you can make this you can do that
and it all worked out and it was just like
[SPEAKER_15]: where's like are you taking into account
crop loss because that's it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_15]: real thing as we've seen recently with
canopy losing the whole crop now I don't
[SPEAKER_15]: think they lost it for the reason that
people think they lost it I think they
[SPEAKER_15]: lost it because they did not get a
particular license that they needed for
[SPEAKER_15]: processing that crop and so it ended up
just sitting there not getting harvested
[SPEAKER_15]: not going anywhere and drying up and dying
but it was definitely a horrific sight to
[SPEAKER_11]: behold how are you feeling about your LEDs
and and where do you think that LED
[SPEAKER_11]: technology is nowadays because part of you
know being a say a conscious indoor
[SPEAKER_11]: farmers is energy you know uptake and and
LEDs are definitely one of the things that
[SPEAKER_11]: can bring your your all-around energy
output down how are you feeling about LEDs
[SPEAKER_11]: now and what are some of the companies you
think are making good ones yeah we've been
[SPEAKER_12]: running LEDs for almost four years now
huge fan of LEDs they're definitely
[SPEAKER_12]: different as far as not only how you build
your grow room around them but how you
[SPEAKER_12]: actually train in your plants and grow
your plants underneath them the energy
[SPEAKER_12]: efficiency is is what it is usually fifty
percent less than what a HID would be you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't quite get the savings on the HVAC
side because what you lack in in cooling
[SPEAKER_12]: you're still gonna have to dehumidify the
air and indoor grow so you're still gonna
[SPEAKER_12]: need tonnage to pull that moisture out
regardless of what you're doing cooling it
[SPEAKER_12]: or not but for the most part LEDs it's a
learning curve they recently had a big
[SPEAKER_12]: breakthrough we had some photo bleaching
with some of our older LEDs I've been
[SPEAKER_12]: chasing that problem for a long time
trying several different brands out the
[SPEAKER_12]: older heavy red LEDs definitely cause
photo bleaching I recently discovered I
[SPEAKER_12]: read a book and saw some things about leaf
surface temperature basically as long as
[SPEAKER_12]: you bring your leaf surface temperature up
you can minimize the photo bleaching even
[SPEAKER_12]: with the old red LEDs but for the most
part the definitely the the full spectrum
[SPEAKER_12]: like what the Fluence is using and
everybody's basically following it is
[SPEAKER_12]: definitely the spectrum to be playing with
I know Illumitex I'm testing them versus
[SPEAKER_12]: Fluence right now I'm also working with a
company from Las Vegas I've worked with
[SPEAKER_12]: several others and yeah the full spectrum
it is a beautiful beautiful lights to work
[SPEAKER_12]: with they're very easy on the eyes on the
plant seem to love them our yield I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: getting organically indoors on average
about a pound and a half or four by four
[SPEAKER_12]: with minimal minimal inputs I went through
kind of a minimal input only compost phase
[SPEAKER_12]: for a while now I'm trying to work with
some SSTs again and things of that nature
[SPEAKER_12]: but for the most part minimal inputs
maximum output in my opinion so do you
[SPEAKER_15]: notice a difference not in vegetative
weights but in yields of resin?
[SPEAKER_12]: Resin I can't say so in our Las Vegas
facility we run HIV we have some pretty
[SPEAKER_12]: frosty flower but definitely turkeys I
feel like they're definitely more
[SPEAKER_12]: flavorful no matter what our cure process
is my prompt facility definitely always
[SPEAKER_12]: tastes better than my Las Vegas facility
and I feel like certain turkeys are a
[SPEAKER_12]: little more volatile to heat and stress
they gas out so I think our prompt
[SPEAKER_12]: facility definitely tastes a lot smoother
due to that that's the only thing I can
[SPEAKER_15]: really point to that would I haven't seen
LED yet produce the resin content that an
[SPEAKER_15]: HPS can produce I want to I've definitely
seen some impressive things from LED
[SPEAKER_15]: lights half the half the the the amperage
you know half the half the lights in the
[SPEAKER_15]: room same yields vegetatively but I'm not
sure about the resin yet I'm not sure that
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen and here's another interesting
fact I get that maybe a hotter room would
[SPEAKER_15]: potentially be thought of to have less
terpenes yet why is it in skunk man Sam
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe you can speak on this why is all the
tastiest herb I've ever tasted come out of
[SPEAKER_15]: an exotic farm somewhere in Jamaica or
another hot country where the it's so hot
[SPEAKER_15]: like for 10 hours or 12 hours this plant
is just under this the tropical Sun
[SPEAKER_15]: beating down on it in a way that you just
think how could there be any terpenes and
[SPEAKER_15]: that thing left in those temperatures
consistently all day every day yet some of
[SPEAKER_15]: the nicest hash I've ever made was was
from that country that the most turk rich
[SPEAKER_15]: product I've pretty much smoked came from
an outdoor field that was very very very
[SPEAKER_06]: hot any idea Sam I don't know really what
to say exactly because it it would have
[SPEAKER_06]: been nice to have a clone of that same
plant that was grown under lights or in a
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse protected to see would it have
been even higher in terpene than right I
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah I do agree that I like the taste
of tropical ganja but I prefer the residue
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah yeah you know that that leads us into
something that we think would be really
[SPEAKER_11]: valuable there is a thing called the
grow-off that's happening in Northern
[SPEAKER_11]: California and it's happening Colorado and
it's really interesting because they take
[SPEAKER_11]: the is that from the grow-off there Craig
they you know they took one clone and gave
[SPEAKER_11]: it out to all different farmers and
they're doing a contest on cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_11]: and terpenes and I think it would be
really wonderful to take that one step
[SPEAKER_11]: further and get soil tests from that so
that we could and also get a list of the
[SPEAKER_11]: inputs that went into it because I think
it would be incredibly valuable to be able
[SPEAKER_11]: to test the soil the inputs and then in
comparison with the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes so Josh and I are partnering with
Ethan Russo right now and asking just
[SPEAKER_04]: these questions you know what is the
difference between all of these different
[SPEAKER_04]: types of growing mediums different areas
that are growing so we're going to take
[SPEAKER_04]: the top winners in that grow-off and we're
going to ask them a lot of multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: questions on where it was grown how it was
grown what kind of mediums that you you
[SPEAKER_04]: utilize you know what what kind of teas
did you use did you have it you know in a
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse light depth and really maybe
try to get you know some more information
[SPEAKER_11]: from it and what are some of the insights
you have on that Sam because we know that
[SPEAKER_11]: you have you know the most experience out
of anyone probably on just you know being
[SPEAKER_11]: able to work with say a clone in many
different environments well of course you
[SPEAKER_06]: need all the environmental conditions you
know whether it's high humidity low
[SPEAKER_06]: humidity daily along with the photo
periods the temperatures the all those
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of questions the water source and
most people don't grow in native soil so
[SPEAKER_06]: in in in theory you could even get the
growers to use all the same soil if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: just trying to test the growers but if you
try to test what makes cannabis better
[SPEAKER_06]: then you probably want differences so that
you can find one that's better yeah I
[SPEAKER_11]: think that would be the idea you know is
to say you know people always said oh the
[SPEAKER_11]: organic that tastes better or you know
that's you know all this stuff and I think
[SPEAKER_11]: it's because the microorganisms in the
soil and I think that you made a good
[SPEAKER_11]: point with the atmosphere and stuff I'd
also like to point out I mean part of the
[SPEAKER_11]: the pure certification is to grow in
native soil and to have those you know
[SPEAKER_11]: that local terroir or Appalachian you know
present and to be able to show how it can
[SPEAKER_11]: bring diversity to a final product and to
a flower for us would be the goal I don't
[SPEAKER_11]: think that we have and you know thing that
we have insight on what we think it might
[SPEAKER_11]: be but it would be really cool to see how
the flower changes in all the different
[SPEAKER_11]: environments and I think it could end up
being that you know the ecologically
[SPEAKER_11]: responsible way of growing is actually
going to produce a better flower and also
[SPEAKER_04]: you know with this grow off there are
going to be a tremendous amount of people
[SPEAKER_04]: that are growing in northern Cali soil and
terroir and maybe we could bring it over
[SPEAKER_04]: to Craig Craig do you got your microphone
on I know that you're part of this grow
[SPEAKER_04]: off I know that you're a really active
community member in this you got your mic
[SPEAKER_15]: on can we hear you know if he can't figure
it out he can bounce and come right oh
[SPEAKER_15]: there it is you figured it out dude all
right beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: we can hear you mic is on fantastic yeah I
don't know if any of you guys know me but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I'm Craig from Alpenglow and I've
been up here in Humboldt County for about
[SPEAKER_00]: 27 28 years and done it every way possible
you know from growing under the trees all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through the whole gamut of
proposition 215 in the front yard to where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at now with state temporary permits
but uh yeah about three years ago we
[SPEAKER_00]: realized we could come out of the green
closet and engage with Josh and Kelly and
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these other minds out there bio
vortex and high tide permaculture and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these folks and gather this knowledge and
kind of put a glossary list to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these practices that we already had so now
that brings us to really engaging into
[SPEAKER_00]: what we would define our to our and our
appellation and we're going to great
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths now to promote our benbo
appellation and and it really you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there there is a reason why southern
humble and the emerald triangle has been
[SPEAKER_00]: on the map on the global map for so long
and that that is our to our appellation
[SPEAKER_00]: our climate it's this region that like no
other we we get the cool nights we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: scorching hot days like you guys were
talking about earlier like in those
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical places and it just brings out the
terpenes and and it goes beyond beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: just the growing and the growing season
but our curing season as well we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal technology i guess or or
environmental controls to even finish off
[SPEAKER_00]: our product we're letting the the dry air
of the day come through our buildings and
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry and cure and then if it comes to
the other level we can open up some doors
[SPEAKER_00]: or windows and bring in some of that moist
ocean air at night to kind of bring a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: balance to do a nice cure and yeah we are
we are engaging deep into bringing our
[SPEAKER_00]: native to our even into our greenhouses
we're gathering forest humus and our local
[SPEAKER_00]: fractured shale that spills off our steep
mountainsides here and we're bringing all
[SPEAKER_00]: that into even into our greenhouses
building hugel beds in our greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: even our greenhouses you know it's not
like not like you're going to think a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse in bc or northern washington
these are these are just essentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover with the doors rolled up the
sidewalls all rolled up and it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really just a way for our light depth to
uh our light depth cover not to drop dust
[SPEAKER_00]: or soil onto the onto the canopy of the
plant it's they're really open air and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're we're able to still pull off two to
three uh light depth runs that way we
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer two because those that third
doesn't really work so good um but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of loop back into the grow off yeah
that that is really interesting we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what jacob up at uh flower days is
doing he he in our local area i think is
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing it as hard as can be them and moon
gazers um with really maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: closed loops it's it's pretty mind-blowing
what those guys are doing just straight
[SPEAKER_00]: off their farms um we're closing loops but
we have to reach a little further we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to stay within uh humble county um
and then if we have to reach we'll reach
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as like petaluma um for some of our
chicken inputs if we need them but um yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really trying to work with what we
have here and we did have two plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow off um we didn't really it's
going to be really interesting because
[SPEAKER_00]: they i'm kind of calling it to no love um
they were kind of really not a priority
[SPEAKER_00]: we're so busy with some of these other
nuances of the summer of um uh permitting
[SPEAKER_00]: and re-permitting and and chasing chasing
that uh legal market we had it in
[SPEAKER_00]: california you know i don't want to go off
too far into this but it's a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the story is and the plight of the uh
small farmer right now they gave us a
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary permit we planted our seeds we
got going and that temporary permit
[SPEAKER_00]: expires by the time we were ready to
harvest so instead of having a seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: sale temporary permit it was just for
three months they didn't really think that
[SPEAKER_00]: through we got the airplanes up in the air
and then they shut down to runways um so
[SPEAKER_00]: we were kind of locked out of the legal
market for a little while until we could
[SPEAKER_00]: shuffle some more paperwork um but uh yeah
i don't i maybe you guys lead me into if
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys have some other questions or so
but um what are some of the things with
[SPEAKER_11]: the grow off that they're they they've
given out the clone and then what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: process after after harvest with that yeah
so i haven't engaged beyond that um i have
[SPEAKER_00]: an email waiting right now um to get the
probably the lab paper work in line and
[SPEAKER_00]: transport documents and so forth but um
ours is still curing we we uh we do this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole uh curing room setup where uh we've
had ours down for about three four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: so in my mind it's almost ready i like to
get it four four to eight man preferably
[SPEAKER_00]: three four month cure personally but um
i'm gonna try to hold on to that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm as long as i can before i get it off
to the lab nice one and another question
[SPEAKER_11]: um i think is really interesting is just
some of the you know the exposure you've
[SPEAKER_11]: been able to to get on your farm in order
to get your name out there in order to be
[SPEAKER_11]: able to you know have sales and all that
that's kind of difficult for all of us i
[SPEAKER_11]: think all of us we try and put a lot into
our farm but then we're also realizing how
[SPEAKER_11]: much you know bringing your name forward
is going to mean something in the future
[SPEAKER_11]: and and so how did it go with the
chocolate company and and what are some of
[SPEAKER_11]: the other things that you know you've
you've done you've done some of the the tv
[SPEAKER_11]: work and then tell us a little bit about
what you're you're doing on that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what we focus on we don't really focus on
promoting alpenglow specifically we we
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on promoting our region we we look
at uh promoting um the dempere the dempere
[SPEAKER_00]: certification is way so heavy in these uh
new markets um we we didn't really realize
[SPEAKER_00]: the value of it at the beginning other
than um an emotional and a a feel-good
[SPEAKER_00]: value to know that we're doing right and
it's been recognized after all these years
[SPEAKER_00]: so that feels really good but literally
now it's whether whether it's a retail
[SPEAKER_00]: partner at soulful down in in sebastopol
eli he that he sources primarily from
[SPEAKER_00]: dempere farmers or uh uh bio um slipped my
mind for a minute um but uh biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers biodynamic thank you um yeah but
yeah so between eli and and and then
[SPEAKER_00]: having having that dempere seal is so
valuable as time goes on and um the
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate company um found us through that
same process and and you know we go we go
[SPEAKER_00]: live on instagram we're just walking
around our garden we're putting our hands
[SPEAKER_00]: in our soil we're just holding up worms
and and just showing the process and
[SPEAKER_00]: having having the public have a intimate
relationship with our soil even though
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in missouri and you know we had
guys from philly stalk me on instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: i held them off at as long as i could i
sent them to soulful they sent me pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of them smoking joints outside their
rental car and then two months later they
[SPEAKER_00]: found their way up to our farm um so
people are really interested and and
[SPEAKER_00]: really really the pathway consumer really
wants to know how their medicine is grown
[SPEAKER_00]: um and i think i think the humble humble
and the emerald triangle we have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that have best practices but
there's been so much negative press around
[SPEAKER_00]: trespass growth specifically and um a lot
of the folks that showed up here that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have that those deeper roots and
the care for the land so as we show that
[SPEAKER_00]: the the consumer is just reaching for it
as well it's almost like we have to just
[SPEAKER_11]: give ourselves time and i think that you
know i think marcus feels this way i think
[SPEAKER_11]: we do too you know we're up here in canada
you know we're looking at this market um
[SPEAKER_11]: we're listening to all the stories in
washington oregon all these different
[SPEAKER_11]: places actually we haven't heard from the
snow grasses yet they're gonna maybe come
[SPEAKER_11]: on they're gonna try to get out of the
organ but uh anyway it's uh it's extremely
[SPEAKER_11]: difficult and i think that you know that's
where we we totally agree with what marcus
[SPEAKER_11]: said in the beginning and then it's just
this it's it's in every state you're
[SPEAKER_11]: landlocked you know you're almost land in
california is and from what wade was
[SPEAKER_11]: saying is that you're almost landlocked in
in each county and and you have an island
[SPEAKER_11]: in every county in california and i feel
in my heart me and kelly have always
[SPEAKER_11]: thought this you know i think that we just
need to stay in business and continue our
[SPEAKER_11]: mission you know over the next few years
because i i just want to believe that it's
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna that it's gonna open up you know
that you that everyone is getting people
[SPEAKER_11]: in america are gonna be able to sell to
anyone in america and and then the world
[SPEAKER_11]: because we are seeing that here in canada
we are talking to licensed producers and
[SPEAKER_11]: we've had lots of meetings and and they
have the ability to to to sell to 30
[SPEAKER_11]: different countries you know on a
medicinal level with certain products so
[SPEAKER_11]: we are seeing the light you know in a
sense and i feel like it's worth us
[SPEAKER_11]: putting in this effort even though it
feels you know a little bit like joining
[SPEAKER_11]: forces with something i want something
really large and i think that it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: important too you know it's like we're
looking at this as if you look at it a
[SPEAKER_04]: holistic level then you have to have
integrity for your business you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: have it for your community you have to
have it to the plant and also you know to
[SPEAKER_04]: your bank account and how is it that you
can continue moving forward and i think
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know if we are able to fill all
of those different facets with so many of
[SPEAKER_04]: you here today on the panel are doing and
you're having incredible success with that
[SPEAKER_04]: and i think and i'm really encouraging
other farmers to you know look at sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: full spectrum and and start to focus
outside of their farm into their community
[SPEAKER_04]: into the people around them as well as
getting their name out there and telling
[SPEAKER_11]: the story of their farm and that's where
you know we talked about sacred commerce i
[SPEAKER_11]: mean yeah we're we're a corporation but
it's the energy behind our corporation
[SPEAKER_11]: that makes us different so you know if
we're going to take lessons from the
[SPEAKER_11]: united fruit company in central america
and their overtake of all the banana farms
[SPEAKER_11]: or or coffee farms and how they you know
they overtake anyone i feel in my heart
[SPEAKER_11]: like you know that i have this we have
this bond with the cannabis plant that's
[SPEAKER_11]: like this magical cultural thing that will
never go away and it's just how can we
[SPEAKER_11]: keep that quality in this market moving
forward i mean it's pretty much what we
[SPEAKER_11]: think about all day long and how can we
continue to have a quality in this and and
[SPEAKER_11]: if we could help and help here a large you
know corporate grower grow more
[SPEAKER_11]: consciously i mean we'll do it we would do
it you know what i mean you know yeah we
[SPEAKER_11]: were giving up anything you know we we are
here to help everyone and that's why we've
[SPEAKER_11]: made all of our information you know
totally available and uh so yeah and josh
[SPEAKER_04]: it's nice to see you back on moon gaze hey
yeah good to be back on internet and yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: but here we are here i brought sandra
sandras here this time yes sandra thank
[SPEAKER_04]: you we love you we love you nice to see
you here this morning and craig was just
[SPEAKER_04]: talking a little bit about the grow off
and i know that you guys are a part of
[SPEAKER_04]: that too and what kind of um you know
things are you all doing you know with
[SPEAKER_04]: that particular plant are you doing
anything special are you joining with
[SPEAKER_04]: community members and uh tell us a little
bit about that well we actually haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: done we actually did not get that plant
from the grow off um there you go i
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you guys did have though and i
hope they have they do it again it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: really fun and i would love to see how our
soils translate into that plant for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: um there's definitely been a lot of talk
around here about forming co-ops so a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of us are kind of getting together and
just sort of learning what that is and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know hopefully when it does come to a
point when we can sell across state lines
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll be organized enough where the small
farmers can unite and together we can sell
[SPEAKER_03]: to you know sell to the big sell you know
in quantity and to a broader market and i
[SPEAKER_11]: think are really important we've uh you
know we're working with a co-op up here in
[SPEAKER_11]: british columbia called the cascadia co-op
and it's a way to collectively bargain and
[SPEAKER_11]: to collectively represent each other in
order to see you know again our way of
[SPEAKER_11]: life our quality move forward and our and
our medicine and how have you guys had
[SPEAKER_04]: success through joining with community
members you guys are out there i mean i'm
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing on your instagram account you're
having people over at your farms you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are really at the forefront of education
with your consumers as well as the farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: in your area how has that been for you
guys in moving your business forward i'd
[SPEAKER_11]: also just really quickly love to ask i
mean you guys do have a biodynamic farm a
[SPEAKER_11]: peer certified farm i think a sun and moon
certified farm and i think that uh you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys really show that you are um you know
growing in a dynamic way with lots of food
[SPEAKER_11]: everywhere i know that you've been out to
cavello out there and some of the other
[SPEAKER_11]: i'd love to hear you know just some of the
inspiration that's that's brought you
[SPEAKER_11]: towards that and how it's helping your
business maybe you know on a cost way
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe on a feel good way um tell us some
of your experiences with that yes you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it being a biodynamic farm and a d and
peer certified farm i mean you know and a
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative cannabis farm award the
emerald cup which you guys also received
[SPEAKER_01]: that year and i mean we basically are just
sticking with our ethos i mean you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: got to mendocino county and we were
working up at the the fry vineyards at
[SPEAKER_01]: their biodynamic farm and we were growing
lots of veggies and you know mucking the
[SPEAKER_01]: barn and we sort of translated that into
our commercial small scale uh cannabis uh
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and growing from seed and that was
the other thing with the grow off too is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we just grow from seed and that's
sort of part of our our how we aim for
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity not just because we do also grow
food among our plants and our canopy you
[SPEAKER_03]: know canopy a seed grow off would be good
um that would be really amazing we got to
[SPEAKER_03]: work on love to see that we got to work on
that one yeah but the endo mendocino
[SPEAKER_03]: county cannabis community is i mean
through legalization we've all come to the
[SPEAKER_03]: forum and it's incredible how many people
we've met um and just this past year you
[SPEAKER_01]: know since yeah big up to mendocino
generations they are a group that has come
[SPEAKER_01]: together and yes they have helped us move
a little bit of product here and there
[SPEAKER_01]: linking up with different distributors
like we're all sort of like mycelium in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way and craig too even though he's not
technically in you know mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: generations but just sort of like
discussing with each other like what's
[SPEAKER_01]: working like how do we you know connect
with this distributor putting the pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: together like a like a network has been
really critical for us to succeed and
[SPEAKER_01]: continue we go out to their farms and we
check them out and we just connect and and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's our community you know smoke a
doobie and and can see oh these these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are our tribe out here you know these guys
are are you know we're connected that's
[SPEAKER_11]: really awesome and the pure certification
has been happening for a while now and so
[SPEAKER_11]: there's just a lot of really strong
connections being made i love how for
[SPEAKER_11]: example tamara heal thyself has had
different farmers grow different herbs so
[SPEAKER_11]: that she can make her her herbal rolls
that she makes and so many others i mean
[SPEAKER_11]: there's kush kirk in southern oregon and
really the you know doing amazing work
[SPEAKER_11]: with hash and i would love to maybe
continue to have different pure farms on
[SPEAKER_11]: on this to be able to tell the different
things that they're doing um you know to
[SPEAKER_11]: be able to to move it all forward there
you go craig's got some good craig that
[SPEAKER_04]: looks pretty beautiful is that your coyote
blue yes tanner tanner what's going on
[SPEAKER_11]: brother i always feel like wrestling now
someone's got to wrestle someone i i was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna i wanted to i wanted to make mention
of one thing that we were kind of talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about and that was value kind of value of
the dempere certification and um one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys pointed out as well you see
a lot of traffic through moon gazers and
[SPEAKER_00]: our farm and lady sativa and and that's
for a reason um what we've realized is
[SPEAKER_00]: this new industry is built on investor
money and with that investment comes a
[SPEAKER_00]: building of a deck so to speak to go get
money and and if if a person starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: company it needs to go find investment
well they need to show their supply line
[SPEAKER_00]: and they need to show where that cannabis
is coming from and who's growing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've realized is that this industry
we we started it from our sweat and our
[SPEAKER_00]: hard work and built our farms out by
bootstrapping it and we've gotten to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point a few years but few years ago maybe
two three years ago and then then we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: the rush of investment coming and then we
realized okay this is this is the path to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down and then all of a sudden we
realized that more pictures need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken more stories need to be told and and
we we realized that it's it's our life and
[SPEAKER_00]: our farm that is um creating that creating
the the security in this new market and
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do we how do we hold on to our
values and how do we keep moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: through all that and and uh some of the
questions are being asked of us is you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we're we're talking about uh value
and economics and when when should a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer finally get paid for their efforts
and their work and and and what all that
[SPEAKER_00]: means to keeping the farm going um and and
um i guess i guess what i'm trying to say
[SPEAKER_00]: is the industry that we built had a new
realization and a lot of attention being
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to it and and for a minute it felt
like we needed to turn over control or
[SPEAKER_00]: turn over um some of our future to these
other powers and that's totally not the
[SPEAKER_00]: case um they want to keep coming they want
to keep finding um the value in us and and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh we just need to figure out how to
organize like moon gazers are saying with
[SPEAKER_00]: these co-ops um we can't you know we can't
collude unless we have a co-op because
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can talk about pricing and then we
can talk about um things of of that nature
[SPEAKER_00]: legally so these co-ops are are 100
important and our photos and our farm
[SPEAKER_00]: images and our stories are our value and
by having it documented on the dem pier
[SPEAKER_00]: website as ours and our story no one else
can take that away because we've shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is ours and we own it even if
it's on the internet so yeah yeah i
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend i recommend everyone to go out
there and and tell your story to instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: tell your story on your website um write
down your sops don't let people take all
[SPEAKER_00]: your knowledge without having solid
agreements around it and it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay to share but how are you being
compensated for that sharing um because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a life work of multiple
generations and to just hand it over you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we get caught up kind of in that
permaculture sharing is caring but sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: is caring if we're it's not if we're being
exploited sharing is scary when you have
[SPEAKER_11]: when you can still feed your family yeah
yeah well i mean i would like to say that
[SPEAKER_11]: julie from skunk magazine is an amazing
woman and she's really putting um her
[SPEAKER_11]: whole entire heart and soul into exactly
everything that you're saying and she's
[SPEAKER_11]: giving us a really big opportunity to be
able to have our voice heard not only here
[SPEAKER_11]: in canada but in the all over the world
and worldwide and and big shout out to
[SPEAKER_11]: skunk magazine and julie and the changes
that they're going to be making now
[SPEAKER_04]: they're they're coming upon something
called the green renaissance and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be really telling these stories
that's what we're talking about it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: green renaissance and i wanted to bring it
back over to ross kaia you know your your
[SPEAKER_04]: business we see your your beautiful brand
out there i know that you've really put
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself forward you guys must be working
day and night to really get your business
[SPEAKER_04]: out there and it does seem to be an
incredible work of love and and what is it
[SPEAKER_04]: that you found that has been successful in
doing that and bringing your your business
[SPEAKER_11]: and you talked about being through one two
three waves right now and everything so
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe you can yeah add some thoughts to
that you know i didn't really want to talk
[SPEAKER_14]: about it today but it seems like i just
kind of should i put in 18 months of work
[SPEAKER_14]: craig craig just brought up some some
really really massively important points i
[SPEAKER_14]: just put in 18 months of work developing a
really great facility and developing ip
[SPEAKER_14]: bringing my ip in business models for this
hash thing i thought i had good contracts
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe i do maybe i don't i can't get into
it a lot but it's super important that you
[SPEAKER_14]: protect yourself and i just i can't like
right now that really is resonating with
[SPEAKER_14]: me and i do have this heart that wants to
share and you know especially in the hash
[SPEAKER_14]: world i felt like when there's competition
within growing the hash guys were always
[SPEAKER_14]: still sharing their knowledge of how to
make better hash and really pushing that
[SPEAKER_14]: forward but i think we're at a time where
you really kind of have to protect that a
[SPEAKER_14]: bit too because once companies have that
then maybe they don't need you anymore and
[SPEAKER_14]: that puts you in a really a really tough
situation sometimes so for me i'm kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: going through some of that and at the same
time it's a blessing because now i'm i'm
[SPEAKER_14]: able to kind of turn my focus back to you
know our little phone here show you out
[SPEAKER_14]: the window out there we've got you know
where we're growing our food and my
[SPEAKER_14]: beautiful wife tati she did some great cvd
readings this year so in the face of kind
[SPEAKER_14]: of this the success but also a failure
because i may not get to see it through i
[SPEAKER_14]: have this this other side that i never
left and that is going to be there for me
[SPEAKER_14]: and so you know don't don't lose don't
sell out for that you know there was a
[SPEAKER_14]: huge pressure i felt you know personally a
huge pressure to catch up you know give
[SPEAKER_14]: get invested get into one of these markets
and the truth is it's getting better every
[SPEAKER_14]: day there's no rush no need to put
yourself forward in a situation where
[SPEAKER_14]: you're not completely covered because it
is going to get better for us and people
[SPEAKER_14]: are valuing you know the methods that that
that we're using to grow herb and to make
[SPEAKER_14]: um make concentrates and you know don't
don't get caught up in that in that rush
[SPEAKER_14]: to you know get legit umized or whatever
it is um you know take your time with it
[SPEAKER_14]: and and make sure that you're talking to
other people and making those connections
[SPEAKER_14]: and that you're all looking out for each
other along that journey so yeah that's
[SPEAKER_11]: that's that's that's well well taken and
we understand you know i mean it's it's
[SPEAKER_11]: part of the network that we're creating is
you know being able to support each other
[SPEAKER_11]: in and some of the successes and some of
the hardships um you know it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_11]: one thing that that you have is that you
can never take away is your experience and
[SPEAKER_11]: and being able to know that you can do
something so that's that's something
[SPEAKER_11]: you'll always have and that's really
important and i think just being able to
[SPEAKER_11]: stay you know adaptogenic you know is is a
really important quality and you know
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going to have to go through some
different things i know marcus is even you
[SPEAKER_11]: know putting a lot into his future and
that future is still you know unfolding at
[SPEAKER_11]: this moment and everything so it's you
know i think being able to have you know
[SPEAKER_11]: not outdo yourself not run too too far
into the high one of the things we we we
[SPEAKER_11]: joke around and say is that don't believe
the hype believe the hyphae you know like
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe we just got to keep it in the hyphae
you know and and the family like look how
[SPEAKER_11]: beautiful this is you know and that's
another thing about the farming you know
[SPEAKER_11]: we've tried to diversify the cannabis
farms you know to say hey what about some
[SPEAKER_11]: you know other added products on the farm
you know what else can we grow that is
[SPEAKER_11]: also really you know maybe we're all of a
sudden we're all growing ginseng you know
[SPEAKER_11]: who knows what it is and even in the
herbal market there's there's there's
[SPEAKER_11]: herbal farmers out there with echinacea
and different things and they're even
[SPEAKER_11]: their markets have dropped out you know
and and in the in the course of things so
[SPEAKER_11]: um we we're just probably going to
continue to move forward with the idea
[SPEAKER_11]: that everything's going to work out
because we have this like love bomb that
[SPEAKER_11]: just like can't be put out you know and
we're starting to work i think marcus you
[SPEAKER_11]: might know martin over in belfast in
ireland we're starting to work with the
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp kitchen and some really awesome
families over in ireland martin gillis yes
[SPEAKER_04]: yes big up to martin and i know martin i
think those guys are working those guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are working really hard in ireland to
become legalized and to bring hemp forward
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're doing it in a real community
way they're joining together and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: they're stepping up marcus your mic is on
there so we're uh yeah that's super
[SPEAKER_04]: exciting and i feel like you know so many
of us felt that pressure that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about kai you know we're feeling
that pressure right now when we get a
[SPEAKER_04]: number from health canada saying that
they're only gonna okay and value 671
[SPEAKER_11]: applications that makes you feel like oh
shit we got to be one of the 671 what do
[SPEAKER_04]: we got to do we got it we got to hurry up
and we got to get investors and we got to
[SPEAKER_04]: rush to the bottom and i just feel like we
don't need to be rushing to the bottom
[SPEAKER_04]: just the slow and steady and like job said
and understanding that we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship with this plant we have a
relationship with the community we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship with our own feelings and our
own happiness and we value that as well
[SPEAKER_04]: and we want to put that in the forefront
of all of this no matter what happens in
[SPEAKER_11]: moving forward and so you know we're
hearing from martin we just had a long
[SPEAKER_11]: conversation with him yesterday how eager
you know let's say irish families and
[SPEAKER_11]: scottish and the uk and beyond but even
for them right now i mean nothing more
[SPEAKER_11]: than the opportunity to have some of the
issues that we're having which would be
[SPEAKER_11]: getting a lot of medicine at their
communities and they're having stuff to
[SPEAKER_11]: just empower each other on a down the dl
to really make everything work i just want
[SPEAKER_11]: to try part of the reason i'm putting this
panel together was to try and get us to
[SPEAKER_11]: all do our best to try and stay in there
and maybe it's moving slowly maybe it's
[SPEAKER_11]: not taking on you know huge investment but
to put to try and stay in there and and
[SPEAKER_11]: and and what we heard from wade and then
what's happening with the cladius cladius
[SPEAKER_11]: network and probably a lot of people here
in canada you know and losing a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: their access let's just say i hope it's a
a short time and and let's do all we can
[SPEAKER_04]: to you know continue that that medicine
and i wanted to ask you sam as well you
[SPEAKER_04]: know you've been in and out of so many
different types of industries and the ups
[SPEAKER_04]: and the downs and the international
whether it's in europe or whether it's in
[SPEAKER_04]: california or on and on and people have
probably you know gone down the toilet and
[SPEAKER_04]: then other people have risen to the top
are you seeing that there's there's sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of a a straight line on what can define
how people are becoming successful in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and moving forward to be honest i
expected when marijuana became fully legal
[SPEAKER_06]: and taxed and regulated which i've fought
for most of my life i expected bankers and
[SPEAKER_06]: lawyers to end up with most of it pretty
quick i mean what big business aren't they
[SPEAKER_06]: controlling the bankers and the lawyers
let's let's be frankly honest there is no
[SPEAKER_06]: big international multinational corporate
business that is not controlled by banks
[SPEAKER_06]: and lawyers that's the way it works so
that doesn't bother me i mean i i buy
[SPEAKER_06]: international brands of things that i like
whether it's a pair of levi pants or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever and uh you know i buy a car you
know so yeah it doesn't really bother me i
[SPEAKER_06]: i just want the home grower to be able to
grow it himself and i also think any small
[SPEAKER_06]: grower that's willing to pass at least a
minimum of regulation to make sure it's
[SPEAKER_06]: safe and effective you know they should be
allowed to to produce it for anybody who
[SPEAKER_06]: wants it and i think it's truly more in
that direction even if it's two step
[SPEAKER_06]: forward one step back two steps forward
one step back we've been fighting this
[SPEAKER_17]: fight a long time and it's not anywhere
near over and uh one of the things i keep
[SPEAKER_17]: reminding myself of it's really about the
plant and our relationship to it and what
[SPEAKER_17]: you said sam about everyone being able to
grow their own i think it's too late to
[SPEAKER_17]: put out that fire for all of the lawyers
and the bankers uh people are going to be
[SPEAKER_17]: able to grow their own how it's going to
look or how it's how long that's going to
[SPEAKER_17]: take who knows uh and i'm sure it'll vary
country to country as marcus made
[SPEAKER_17]: reference to earlier malaysia is
considering not hanging the guy who's been
[SPEAKER_17]: uh providing medicine to people in
malaysia but they have to change the law
[SPEAKER_06]: but the parliament says they're going to
change the law and save his butt well yeah
[SPEAKER_17]: i was just talking about how different
jurisdictions have are making different
[SPEAKER_17]: rates of progress and uh it's kind of sad
that uh the places that are trying to
[SPEAKER_17]: regulate it and make it available for
adult use or medical use are uh doing so
[SPEAKER_17]: poorly at it we could say it like that but
it's really about the plant and it's about
[SPEAKER_17]: our relationship to the plant and what
this plant can do for us if we if we keep
[SPEAKER_17]: that in mind uh personally as well as
socially all across the planet literally
[SPEAKER_17]: as the rastas used to say it's the healing
of the people they still say it they still
[SPEAKER_00]: say it you know one thing one thing i
would add to all this and that is um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we're we're a bunch of farmers and
cultivators and hash makers here and and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're business people in our own right but
we keep talking about the the bankers and
[SPEAKER_00]: the lawyers and there's i know there's a
handful of bankers and lawyers out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that really really appreciate our dempere
sungrown so we are going to need some help
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to need some of these
strategic relationships to help us do what
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do so we're not sitting here
shaking our heads so we have good
[SPEAKER_00]: information not only in our growing and
our cultivation and our inputs but our
[SPEAKER_00]: outputs and how our outputs what are their
sops strains you know all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to need some more help and um
i just i just want to put that out there
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a big difference between them helping
us and them basically taking over from us
[SPEAKER_06]: because corporations especially
international multinationals are they're
[SPEAKER_06]: sharks i mean uh that's probably the way
most of them are there's exceptions i mean
[SPEAKER_06]: i i own a couple of corporations i was
never a sharky at all but uh yeah i mean
[SPEAKER_06]: it wasn't a big giant corporation with
thousands of employees even just just to
[SPEAKER_14]: throw it out there washington state i
think it's more than 50 percent of all the
[SPEAKER_14]: retail stores are owned by lawyers so it's
a little fun fact i was just gonna i've
[SPEAKER_10]: been kind of wanting to toss into
washington state you know because we've
[SPEAKER_10]: been at this you know for a minute and you
know kaya thanks for sharing um you know
[SPEAKER_10]: what you've been up to man in mad respect
you have changed the hash the game in this
[SPEAKER_10]: state you know for the better people know
know a lot more about what's available so
[SPEAKER_10]: uh thank you so much for that bro and
thanks for just being vulnerable but um we
[SPEAKER_10]: lost 45 percent of our uh producer
processors this summer um and it's that's
[SPEAKER_10]: crazy you guys 45 percent of people and
the thing that is weird in washington is
[SPEAKER_10]: we are a market mostly of i say
contractors and real estate agents um and
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of those people threw in their
retirements and started this business in
[SPEAKER_10]: 2014 and um they lost it all and they're
real people they may not have been uh
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis people for the last 25 years but
they you know are real people and um yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: we're just i'm just i'm just trying to say
we're going through that shift and and
[SPEAKER_10]: then i really just echo that message that
josh and kelly were saying they said it
[SPEAKER_10]: last january like hold tight you know
start growing veggies start doing whatever
[SPEAKER_10]: you can do to to hold on to your business
and um i'm i'm doing that i'm holding on
[SPEAKER_10]: you know just by the threads and i'm i'm
just a soul guy like i'm started
[SPEAKER_10]: hashtagging it now like i'm a farmer of
one like i'm gonna grow what i can grow
[SPEAKER_10]: and sell what i can grow and take care of
my family and um i don't know so hashtag
[SPEAKER_15]: buy a thread yeah buy a thread how about
how about a new bill the just let us
[SPEAKER_15]: fucking have it bill i would vote for that
bill just let us fucking have it and i i
[SPEAKER_04]: think that also you know addressing what
you were saying sam is yeah i i do think
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know it's inevitable these huge
big large corporations that are stepping
[SPEAKER_04]: in there are big huge large corporations
at least here in canada that really don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have uh real knowledge on how to actually
grow the commodity that it is that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: selling which is a really interesting
thing to me but the thing that i feel most
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned about is the exploitation of the
land in canada i'm extremely i'm extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: forward in the cannabis industry as well
so this is a really big concern of mine
[SPEAKER_04]: with the corporations and and what it is
that they're doing i think that i agree
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's a heavy albatross to put around
cannabis's neck i mean let's face it most
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis will not be grown bio dynamically
organically in the future i wish it was
[SPEAKER_06]: but uh i i like it it's much superior the
way i've grown for 50 years but that said
[SPEAKER_06]: how much of our food in canada or america
is grown organically bio dynamically you
[SPEAKER_11]: know that just solidifies the fact that
everything that we're doing is always
[SPEAKER_11]: going to have a place in the world because
every single time we go out into the
[SPEAKER_11]: public and we put out 24 jars of our ganja
on the counter everyone wants it i mean we
[SPEAKER_11]: just did it two weeks ago we were in
vancouver at an amazing event called the
[SPEAKER_06]: kid what you're saying is the more schlaks
there are out there the more of the rest
[SPEAKER_11]: of it yeah bring on the schlaks i mean
it's not good for it's not good it's not
[SPEAKER_11]: good for the earth so we're going to
continue with the healthy access to humans
[SPEAKER_06]: and healthy access to the earth because
i've always tried to leave the soil
[SPEAKER_06]: healthier and a better condition than when
i started with it and that's regenerative
[SPEAKER_11]: we appreciate that you know about your
work and and and any way that we can
[SPEAKER_11]: continue really to we can talk to each
other about farmers that's really
[SPEAKER_11]: important but we have to continue to get
the message out to the to the people that
[SPEAKER_11]: need the medicine so when the people that
are buying the medicine know the
[SPEAKER_11]: difference between a flood and drained
three million square foot greenhouse using
[SPEAKER_11]: chemicals when they if they have an option
to grow to herd from our farm to get other
[SPEAKER_11]: from a three million square foot area
that's being flood and drain every hour i
[SPEAKER_11]: really it is a pretty easy donation so
everything what we have is is into
[SPEAKER_04]: education for that and like you said and
like you said it is going against the
[SPEAKER_04]: beast i mean you didn't say that per se
but it really is going against the large
[SPEAKER_04]: beast and i think that i know that josh
and i are going to take our last nine
[SPEAKER_04]: breath fighting for this plant fighting
for access healthy access not just access
[SPEAKER_04]: to patients but healthy access to patients
and healthy environment in which to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: in and i feel like it's it's a worthy um
thing to fight for and it's another fight
[SPEAKER_11]: is midwifery and we won't get into it but
home birth and and and breastfeeding and
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's a human right that's being
attacked you know across the world too so
[SPEAKER_11]: we we don't see a difference really in the
fight really we're just earth warriors
[SPEAKER_11]: that really our last breath is going to be
you know save the plant save the human do
[SPEAKER_06]: something for the soil you know go hug
someone i delivered my first child myself
[SPEAKER_06]: at home oh i bet your wife was there they
didn't come to think of it yes she was
[SPEAKER_15]: nice i i also helped helped uh deliver my
first two children at home as well yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: and the last boy in the truck a lot of the
peer certified farm farmers are having
[SPEAKER_11]: home births and big love to flower days
and for giving birth in the car i know
[SPEAKER_04]: that was an incredible experience for you
all kaio like to hear that story and the
[SPEAKER_04]: empowerment that your family got out of
that is just like i tell that story all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time so big ups to your family for
joining together and making that magic
[SPEAKER_15]: happen ups to the women that's pretty cool
actually that's pretty cool because now
[SPEAKER_15]: you could literally be almost anywhere in
the world with that vehicle and tell your
[SPEAKER_11]: child you were born right here you got to
keep the car and grow weed out of it or
[SPEAKER_11]: something like when it dies or you know
i'm just playing but you know hey rio's
[SPEAKER_11]: back and and um you know you i we i don't
know if you you you have something to to
[SPEAKER_11]: say that you're back but we know that
you're really active along with you know
[SPEAKER_11]: craig in the humbled area and just getting
you know education to the community you
[SPEAKER_11]: know what are what are some of the things
that you're doing in your community that
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe you could tell us about or something
about your farm that's really awesome this
[SPEAKER_16]: year that you're really stoked about oh
thanks for having me back um yeah we did a
[SPEAKER_16]: couple years ago we did a values
conference so we invited 60 plus people to
[SPEAKER_16]: the material community center and we did a
whole process facilitated process on how
[SPEAKER_16]: what are the values that are intrinsic to
the back to the land movement and they
[SPEAKER_16]: were beautiful we narrowed them down and
we we uh we came up with nine values that
[SPEAKER_16]: uh that some of them were like uh the
earth is sacred and and and sustains us
[SPEAKER_16]: and we have to honor that by not polluting
and being sacred uh living in a in a way
[SPEAKER_16]: that that is sacred to the earth one was
we're a refugee area from people for
[SPEAKER_16]: people that want to escape the dominant
paradigm and we need to stay open to new
[SPEAKER_16]: people that come into our community and
and and figure out ways to incorporate
[SPEAKER_16]: them uh one is that our health care system
is integral to our lifestyle that it's not
[SPEAKER_16]: just a prescriptive health care system
it's a uh it's a it's a life of health
[SPEAKER_16]: preventative health so they were we just
went through and uh and and i think that
[SPEAKER_16]: they'll live that we we wrote them out and
we're gonna use them in our economic
[SPEAKER_16]: development plans and you know like craig
and i in building these independent
[SPEAKER_16]: network businesses we try to reach out to
businesses that hold shared values and
[SPEAKER_16]: really make use this organic networking as
a system of that's a in opposition to like
[SPEAKER_16]: it's a whole different value that's what i
mean it seems like the struggle is a value
[SPEAKER_16]: struggle between people that work in a
certain way and don't don't want to get
[SPEAKER_16]: wrapped into this this other value system
so how do we build a system of independent
[SPEAKER_16]: free thinking creative uh and uh a whole
like network just like regenerative
[SPEAKER_16]: farming a regenerative economic system
where money flows just like nutrients flow
[SPEAKER_16]: in cycles and and uh and and inspire
people so no that exactly that's that's
[SPEAKER_11]: exactly what it is and and i think that we
don't i think that the way that we do it
[SPEAKER_11]: is we do it we don't ask for permission we
do it because we don't really need them to
[SPEAKER_11]: like it or not we don't need language
that's owned by us so we can position
[SPEAKER_04]: either the idea of fighting something
doesn't really need to happen i think that
[SPEAKER_04]: we can just be part of something and lead
it and sander now i can see your face in
[SPEAKER_04]: there girl i know that you have been a
really big part in getting out the message
[SPEAKER_04]: to your community and you're doing a lot
in creating sacred commerce and i'm just
[SPEAKER_04]: wondering like what kind of things have
you been up to that have been really
[SPEAKER_04]: helpful to your community what kind of
feedback are you getting from consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: for the energy that you're putting out
people really want to come to the farm
[SPEAKER_03]: that's something that i'm really noticing
people really want to come and see the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and be with it and you know i think
there's so much content available to
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody people are ready to like see the
real thing too like yeah that's really
[SPEAKER_11]: really true i i almost feel like it's a
gift to humanity to get people on the farm
[SPEAKER_11]: ones that don't have the ability to
connect with the earth ones that are stuck
[SPEAKER_11]: in cities because that's the way they live
because that's what's been given to them
[SPEAKER_11]: because that's what they do they it's been
a thing so for hundreds of years people
[SPEAKER_11]: have had to go you know go out to to milk
a cow or you know just to there's probably
[SPEAKER_11]: like a measurable um health impact that
you would get by you by bringing someone
[SPEAKER_11]: down to the farm so i i think maybe in
moving forward it's actually kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: difficult i want to say because a lot of
people have wanted to come to our farm too
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a bit difficult to manage a farm and
then have like to manage people coming on
[SPEAKER_11]: the farm and i know craigs and there's a
lot of it's kind of a thing so big up to
[SPEAKER_04]: you all for doing that and are you all
finding that consumers are coming on to
[SPEAKER_04]: your farm as well not only just people
that want to learn about your growing
[SPEAKER_04]: practices are you educating consumers in
um in on your farm visits as well as you
[SPEAKER_04]: know a lot of the community work that you
all are doing well it's kind of really in
[SPEAKER_03]: the early stage we haven't you know agreed
to that much yet but kind of the vibe i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: getting is that that's one thing that we
have to offer that's what people want from
[SPEAKER_03]: us and so just kind of in the early stages
making partnerships like say with soulful
[SPEAKER_03]: for instance like you know if they have
some um customers that are really you know
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe through them we they can come here
kind of just slowly learn you know
[SPEAKER_03]: developing relationships with partners and
starting slow just like everything we're
[SPEAKER_03]: not bringing the buses you know we got
neighbors what happens when people imbibe
[SPEAKER_03]: here and leave it's just it's complicated
so like everything just gradually trying
[SPEAKER_11]: it seeing how it feels you know there is a
really important point of autonomy there
[SPEAKER_11]: you know and for sure you wouldn't be
bringing buses and there's a lot of farms
[SPEAKER_11]: that deal with theft and that's a really
big issue and i know it's huge i know
[SPEAKER_11]: people that have had a lot of those
problems so you know it's almost like we
[SPEAKER_11]: need like a a model farm to exactly
cannabis cannabis tourism of course this
[SPEAKER_15]: is a job you don't even have to sell the
cannabis at that point in time it's just
[SPEAKER_15]: like a public farm just come on to our
farm like come check out and you can grow
[SPEAKER_15]: some you can take a clone you can kind of
get your hands dirty get involved
[SPEAKER_15]: understand what's going on here tour the
whole place that's going to be a thing for
[SPEAKER_06]: sure people will plant farms in the
netherlands in bruningen i think two years
[SPEAKER_06]: in a row they planted like a several acre
field and then made a maze out of it
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly all the local community kids who
go through the maze and it was flowering
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp plants that's awesome we got to make
a kinship ganja maze where the beginning
[SPEAKER_11]: of the maze is the land races from
different countries and as you walk
[SPEAKER_11]: through the maze the the crosses come and
you see the original skunks come out and
[SPEAKER_11]: then all of a sudden the skunks gonna
northern lights grow and the jeep that all
[SPEAKER_11]: of a sudden we're into the drive the end
we're going through fields of coffee you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what i mean like that would be let's
do that yeah hike from hike from you know
[SPEAKER_03]: go from garden to you know path down to
another it could be amazing i mean they do
[SPEAKER_05]: it with wineries section an african
section a uh indian section i like it
[SPEAKER_11]: we're all sold we're all like yeah let's
do this like model that we're trying to to
[SPEAKER_04]: create and there there is institutions and
education
[SPEAKER_04]: there's there's an institution facility
that people can country of it there you
[SPEAKER_04]: know the piece of property where you can
you can see all of the cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_04]: being used and why they're being used and
i think that it is the next step in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis to give her her time so that
people from the outside can understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: history of it and how we moved this
forward and also have a place of education
[SPEAKER_04]: where everybody can put into it that would
be really wonderful and it is something
[SPEAKER_04]: that we are working on right now and by
all of us joining together in all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: different regions we have the ability to
make that shine maybe in the next five or
[SPEAKER_04]: ten years because we're gathering
information now from each other and you
[SPEAKER_11]: know farming is not just a thing for
california and southern oregon you know
[SPEAKER_11]: there's this sort of thought that is you
farther you go north you know the more you
[SPEAKER_11]: got to go indoors and it's not true i mean
we we don't grow indoors you know we might
[SPEAKER_11]: start some of our seeds initially under
lights because we do have a shorter season
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's biting cold in the spring and
it's biting cold in the fall so we we do
[SPEAKER_11]: have a window but we grow amazing
cultivars up here in canada in native soil
[SPEAKER_11]: and that means that anyone below us can do
it and a lot of people i know there's
[SPEAKER_11]: people in alaska doing it we talk to them
all the time in fact jeff lowenfeld is one
[SPEAKER_11]: of the most you know well-known people in
cannabis and he's in anchorage and he's
[SPEAKER_11]: helping gardeners all the time in alaska
so a lot like craig was saying he you know
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just putting over you know it's
basically a cover to be able to open up
[SPEAKER_04]: your greenhouse so that you can do your
light depping and that no dust or anything
[SPEAKER_04]: gets on that we're doing the same exact
thing up here in bc because we're finding
[SPEAKER_04]: that if we close up our greenhouses at all
we're just allowing pathogens to breed and
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're really taking on a lot of what
northern cali has taught the industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: now we've been doing that up here for over
10 years and that's what works for us so
[SPEAKER_04]: the idea of you know that you can't run
certain cultivars in northern areas the
[SPEAKER_04]: key is that not that you can't run them
the key is when are you finished so light
[SPEAKER_04]: depping and being able to grow in terroir
and being able to grow in natural sun is
[SPEAKER_04]: very powerful for lots of different
reasons number one economics to the farmer
[SPEAKER_04]: number two we feel like it's a higher
quality product number three it's better
[SPEAKER_04]: for the environment and number four it
creates more community and families and
[SPEAKER_04]: education around what it is to actually
grow in the earth where plants actually
[SPEAKER_11]: come from plants come from the earth and
number five is that it is an economically
[SPEAKER_11]: smart and intelligent way to move your
business forward especially up in the
[SPEAKER_11]: north where you think it has to all be
grown hydroponically and indoors which is
[SPEAKER_11]: that's the joke but you know i think that
any producer up here in british columbia
[SPEAKER_11]: and as soon as you get over towards the
coast in vancouver and you get into the
[SPEAKER_11]: gulf islands i mean there's a lot of
potential over there to grow underneath
[SPEAKER_11]: the sun and i think it's going to be
essential for people to do that so the
[SPEAKER_11]: collection of people here from all
different places all of these lessons
[SPEAKER_11]: really we are all sharing something that
works for each other and now we can use
[SPEAKER_11]: these forward and we got to get um good
growing techniques more of them happening
[SPEAKER_11]: up here in british columbia so marcus has
enough glands to work with i need those
[SPEAKER_15]: glands i need those glands i got i got
some glands here i got a little a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of glands yeah i was gonna i was gonna
speak to the point about um the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: farm everyone was describing and that is
precisely what we have built out at
[SPEAKER_00]: alpenglow and uh lady sativa it's uh this
discovery when someone comes they can
[SPEAKER_00]: discover the land and discover the
different cultivars and realize this this
[SPEAKER_00]: path literally a path they can walk down
for us um they can walk past uh 45 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of towar and that means to me i know 45
years ago on this ridge line we're
[SPEAKER_00]: standing next to some pots that were
nailed to the trees i knew the neighbor
[SPEAKER_00]: got busted by airplanes 45 years ago right
here so that's that's really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to folks to know that they're standing
where where there's a lot of history with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivation and then uh some of the
other things we've done is we have with
[SPEAKER_00]: easy access because not everyone can
access the remote parts of the farm but uh
[SPEAKER_00]: at lady sativa and at alpenglow right
outside our our main parking space is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can walk through a whole example of um the
different cultivars that are on the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: lady sativa rio he had every example of of
all his plants and strains um right right
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top of the ridge and then um then
you walk down through just like you said
[SPEAKER_00]: those corn mazes literally there was
cannabis mazes took you all the way down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the property and then we we would walk
a goat path through the woods and end up
[SPEAKER_00]: at the sunset point and walking that goat
path made us think about how it was maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years ago with a with a bag of inputs
over the shoulder and we're able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these stories and share the
history and it's been just super super
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing the response we get and that the
giggle factor people get when leaves are
[SPEAKER_11]: brushing their cheeks yeah through the
trees is probably really healing to the
[SPEAKER_11]: soul too amazing maybe um can you tell us
something about your african cultivars rio
[SPEAKER_16]: yeah i just need to get you guys those i
probably i crossed the uh sheshamani
[SPEAKER_16]: cherry pie with durban poison this year um
which i think is going to come in a little
[SPEAKER_16]: earlier but uh this uh yeah sheshamani i
still have that kenyan bushweed uh which
[SPEAKER_16]: is like super spicy um i don't know what
to do with that i was going to um bring it
[SPEAKER_16]: to an og or something so it had like a
peppery vice um and then we still have
[SPEAKER_16]: those columbian bars but they i mean
they're still out there they're probably
[SPEAKER_16]: not coming into like late december so i
don't they don't really produce up here
[SPEAKER_16]: but crossing them into earlier other
sativas this is something that i'm still
[SPEAKER_16]: playing with um but the people when they
see the sativa next to the indica in the
[SPEAKER_16]: same garden that's exciting you know when
they see the thin leaf plants and the
[SPEAKER_16]: broad leaf plants and the short squatty
plants and the and they see them all
[SPEAKER_16]: together um it's like a whole different
form of agriculture so it's inspiring and
[SPEAKER_16]: they're big enough they were big enough
before we harvested that there's a tunnel
[SPEAKER_16]: maze that you literally walk down a path
and uh they're 14 feet tall and you're
[SPEAKER_16]: going through the maze and then you come
out to the different views and that's our
[SPEAKER_16]: goal is to have these forest paths and
then have native plant species that are
[SPEAKER_16]: endemic to this area and have different
herbs and really cultivate the whole
[SPEAKER_16]: landscape which fits into the whole
bioregional or uh regenerative thing
[SPEAKER_16]: anyway is really re redefine the garden
space as the entire um just somebody tried
[SPEAKER_16]: to call me um and not just cannabis but
all the other herbs and all the and i'm
[SPEAKER_16]: still learning so i continuously hired new
permaculture it's a life journey yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_16]: yeah i'm more yeah for the long haul than
than i am i seem to reinvest all my money
[SPEAKER_04]: in plants but um i think that you brought
up something really i think you brought up
[SPEAKER_04]: something really important rio too is that
you know it you were saying it runs into
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole regenerative movement you know
as far as like you're growing all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: different cultivars and and it's like
you're not pushing cultivars that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow in your area you're allowing your
area to grow certain cultivars what is it
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to have amazing success what
is it that we call biological intelligence
[SPEAKER_04]: to your zone and area and i just think
that you touched on absolute gold there
[SPEAKER_04]: that it can be so helpful to educate a lot
of farmers out there to really be growing
[SPEAKER_04]: what works in your zone and area and have
success in that and to test it out so you
[SPEAKER_16]: know i i'd probably lose 20 plants a year
but at least i i that's my favorite part
[SPEAKER_16]: of the whole thing is to test something
out and see how it does and then to take a
[SPEAKER_16]: make a cross with something that you think
that would bring it back into being in the
[SPEAKER_16]: area and i think those land ray strains
going back onto those early landway
[SPEAKER_16]: strains may makes the plant so healthy
like that shishamani cherry pie now is
[SPEAKER_16]: amazing there's a few different types and
phenos but uh um it seems like the adapts
[SPEAKER_16]: more over time to your area at least it
does climatize i mean i i think we've made
[SPEAKER_11]: a lot of seeds up here and brought them
you know down south down there and and a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of the the reaction we get is that
there's just an incredible amount of vigor
[SPEAKER_11]: to it and stuff so i think you know it's
just hard environment up here it grows
[SPEAKER_11]: good down there you know i think it's now
it's not bio regional but i mean that's
[SPEAKER_11]: using the earth and it's different
environments and and to for the benefit of
[SPEAKER_11]: of all but yeah climatizing it you see it
over a year one year of doing that work
[SPEAKER_11]: the next year you'll see results it may
not be your end result but it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a result yeah i would i would speak to
that as well we we had the zillies gift um
[SPEAKER_00]: from you guys zellies or zillies gift uh
by homesteader and at the end that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needed no structure um it made it through
the rains it was an incredible incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: plant so strong um when people would take
our tour we
[SPEAKER_00]: have this zone that has a lot of plant and
what's seeds that crack and share and my
[SPEAKER_00]: goodness he starts opening up the boxes
and the boxes and the boxes and i i try to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little more defined with having four
or five cultivars and he just keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing them out and it's like this
pandora's box you want to go deeper and
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper but you know you're going to get in
trouble in a good way sometimes good
[SPEAKER_04]: that's sweet and i think that it's so
important for us to share cultivars you
[SPEAKER_04]: know i'm going to bring it back to kaya i
mean growing your coffee you know we were
[SPEAKER_04]: actually able to keep a clone on the very
last day that we harvested that plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're really excited to bring her back she
was just so beautiful and we could feel
[SPEAKER_04]: the love and intention so craig you're
talking about growing our genetics in rio
[SPEAKER_04]: we're really stoked about the shashamani i
mean to partake in smoking one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: shashamanis was a really special evening
on your farm and a big love to mary there
[SPEAKER_04]: on the farm there too and your whole crew
yeah and and and the coyote blue what a
[SPEAKER_04]: wonderful strain so if we share this with
each other then we can really not only you
[SPEAKER_04]: know without being like too far out there
in the spiritual zone but you know to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to feel each other's energy grow it
on our farm and see how it does careful on
[SPEAKER_11]: the spiritual there i can't help it
careful on that but that's all i got so
[SPEAKER_11]: you know it's it's it's like on one level
we're just trying to exist and and on
[SPEAKER_11]: another level we're just we're just
throwing a hail mary and shooting for the
[SPEAKER_11]: you know hitting a home run because we
want the earth to be healthy too so we're
[SPEAKER_11]: we're really just going for the home run
you know we're we're going to go for a
[SPEAKER_11]: healthy environment good genetics and a
really prosperous amazing business so you
[SPEAKER_11]: know we in that we can have it all we can
have it all there there was a movie just
[SPEAKER_11]: made in on the eel river there are rivers
last chance and and bio vortex and the
[SPEAKER_11]: regenerative farm or jesse and and high
tai they were all doing really amazing um
[SPEAKER_11]: documentation um in the movie about how
the river has changed and how salmon have
[SPEAKER_11]: come back not just on you know farming but
also logging practices and stuff so but
[SPEAKER_04]: how the regenerative cannabis movement is
helping the eel river to come back and how
[SPEAKER_04]: those illegal crop grows with the npk and
the synthetic fertilizers were killing the
[SPEAKER_04]: salmon so let's let's say it is empowering
let's think of ourselves as all part of
[SPEAKER_11]: the same team because you know up here in
a lot of places in british columbia are
[SPEAKER_11]: filled with radical conscientious
objectors that came up from california to
[SPEAKER_11]: avoid the war and they came out to live on
the land and cultivate genetics and those
[SPEAKER_11]: people brought you know genetics from
california to british columbia way back in
[SPEAKER_11]: you know the early 70s and stuff and we we
are all the same we can fly a different
[SPEAKER_11]: flag we can maybe we have to answer to
different agencies and stuff but we are
[SPEAKER_11]: one family and we're and every time we put
a plant in the earth we're planting in the
[SPEAKER_11]: same pot we're putting our hands in the
same dirt we have the same microbiome and
[SPEAKER_11]: and and and i we just have a tremendous
amount of love and respect for everyone
[SPEAKER_11]: and we just want everyone to know we're
gonna fight and maybe it's not a fight
[SPEAKER_11]: we're gonna join it and bring our best
we're gonna just live we're gonna live and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're gonna show it can be done and i
wanted to really you know we are riding on
[SPEAKER_04]: the coca coattails you know sam you remind
us often that it's not really maybe land
[SPEAKER_04]: race strains but we're working with land
racist strains because of the hard work
[SPEAKER_04]: that has been done before us and there's
not even a part of us that is letting go
[SPEAKER_04]: of you know all of that good advice and
all those good genetics that have been
[SPEAKER_04]: sent down to us and and we just really
want to continue running with it because
[SPEAKER_04]: our children now are a part of this and
they're a huge part of our business and we
[SPEAKER_04]: actually wouldn't have a business or
harvest at all if it weren't for our kids
[SPEAKER_04]: and i want to pass down the best to them
and i just want to thank you too sam for
[SPEAKER_04]: being that generation before us to help
pass down that knowledge and everyone else
[SPEAKER_04]: who is an elder to us and the harlequin
wow it's really changed the industry you
[SPEAKER_04]: know you doing that hard work now has
passed it on to all of us that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: continue moving forward and healing the
plant and healing the soil and healing the
[SPEAKER_11]: nation thank you josh joshua for putting
together an event that highlights growing
[SPEAKER_11]: practices and i want to encourage everyone
to look at the the regenerative science of
[SPEAKER_11]: regenerative cannabis um event and and
especially here in british columbia i'd
[SPEAKER_11]: like i'd like to see a good turnout here
in british columbia because we don't up
[SPEAKER_11]: here we don't get the same type of
exposure as oregon and california and even
[SPEAKER_11]: washington gets so this is a huge
opportunity for people in british columbia
[SPEAKER_11]: to come together and and have and have our
voices heard we are meeting up with really
[SPEAKER_11]: amazing concerns up here in british
columbia and we would like to know what's
[SPEAKER_11]: up like to say that british columbia is
making is coming really soon making a big
[SPEAKER_11]: a big um splash in the industry and we're
going to highlight some really amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: farms up here part of the reason why bc
even has a place on this map is because of
[SPEAKER_04]: marcus is because of this ability marcus
you have been pushing the show forward
[SPEAKER_04]: when it wasn't even cool when it was
totally legal and people didn't even know
[SPEAKER_04]: what a resin head was and the education
that you brought forward and putting your
[SPEAKER_04]: you know family on the line and your
freedom on the line doesn't go without
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible recognition and big ups thank
you so much and all of the camera work and
[SPEAKER_11]: and your family we appreciate your family
huge respect um yeah it's getting getting
[SPEAKER_11]: in the day so yeah just big love to
everyone yeah much love for the kind words
[SPEAKER_15]: i'm uh you know uh a single step in the
ladder and the ladder goes high so happy
[SPEAKER_15]: to be able to stand on the shoulders of
giants like skunk man and many others and
[SPEAKER_15]: uh yeah just huge props to the dem crew
for uh for putting this hash church
[SPEAKER_15]: together and bringing all these great
people in we had a nice little talk today
