[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time in Hash Church today,
and I figured I'd take you guys along for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little motorcycle ride to a special park
here in British Columbia, Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_00]: West Vancouver that I absolutely love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called... What is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon we'll be around the corner and we'll
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite parks, I come here all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right along Marine Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to be confused with Lynn Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, so I just got to the
entrance of this park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this park is called Sandy Cove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just had a little bit of an experience on
the motorcycle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled up and I went to park the bike
and I put my foot down and there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of mud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize how thick it was and when
I put my foot down my foot slid just
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to pull the bike over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulled all my momentum, all my weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily there was a young guy by the name
of Ryan waiting at the top of the road for
[SPEAKER_00]: a ride and he was able to run over and
help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm under the highway right now for those
of you that are wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up there and now I am down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool little trail that leads in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy Cove Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty short little entrance that
gets you in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've very rarely seen many people in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys enjoying the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful park for doing such things.
Are you taking a video?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm making a little video for my
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, a couple of happy folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see where we come out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made it out here to the Pacific
Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured this would be a nice little dab
spot to bring the bubble man's world
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys enjoy coming on the trips
or so I heard today in Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_00]: which once again, I just like to say guys
was an absolute wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to have so many of you show
up, really share your experiences with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was touching some of the stories
and some of the people that came in really
[SPEAKER_00]: were sharing very personal things and we
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try and balance this thing on here
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my dab tools ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best for visibility,
but wow, what a beautiful day out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of wish I had water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty darn thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, how's that for an impressive spider
web?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys catching that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That big guy there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one down here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to want this sitting in a
way propped up in a way so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually lights us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now probably it won't be the best idea to
put it on top of the bag until I've pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: out all the important tools that we're
going to require for this quick dab sesh
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are about to do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of show you a bit of that view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to cut it all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying my best here, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a fisherman over here pulling
the nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like they just pulled up with their
boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail, hash, dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nail, hash, dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go put some water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water in the little hitman as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman all sorted out with salt water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a salt watery rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've been sure where I put the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I pulled it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nail always comes in handy with the
hitman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll pop that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, try to stand at a reasonable distance
so I'm not right up on the camera with my
[SPEAKER_00]: head chopped out of it, but I don't really
have a table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little bit of a
workout, especially for the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to have to be steady hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steady hand Richardson is what they call
me out here dabbing on the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys want to learn where this
particular place is, when you're heading
[SPEAKER_00]: south, north, west, northwest on Marine
Drive, which is Marine Drive North,
[SPEAKER_00]: which when you come off of the Lions Gate
Bridge, if you go left or right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going into North Vancouver or West
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take the West Vancouver left,
which wraps around and takes you towards
[SPEAKER_00]: Whistler, the lower, it's the old highway
basically before the big highway got put
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you pass the gas station,
about six kilometers from the bridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll come up to a bridge and I showed it
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got it's basically and I'll show it
right at the end of the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys get an idea where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the staircase right next to
the end of this little bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rails on each side that are kind
of silver and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the at the end, you just pull in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll name I'll give you guys the street
name as well when we get up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's just the staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come down here and there's literally
this beautiful, almost private beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys can see there's
some people right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm squashing their heads,
squashing their heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any new kids in the hall fans out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the squashing your heads video?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was classic, classic hilarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're doing a brave move
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the dab on the dabber and we're
now going to heat up our nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside dabbing is always a little bit
tricky just because you can't really see
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat of the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go by the sound as long as the torch is
making the right sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm I'm heating it up good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, it's not windy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's literally no wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily get a good dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs up guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably going to relax, sit on the beach,
see if I can't catch some seals,
[SPEAKER_00]: dolphins, or whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if we do, I'll definitely share
with you guys the wonderful audience of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't thank you guys enough for
subscribing, for sharing the videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: for talking about it, for being a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, Bubble Man's World is
nothing without the world of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes up all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you enjoyed the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think we'll call it a day on
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I see anything cool, I'll
definitely share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll I'll make sure that I write in
the comments the name of that street that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can turn right on to park to get down
to this beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will talk to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
