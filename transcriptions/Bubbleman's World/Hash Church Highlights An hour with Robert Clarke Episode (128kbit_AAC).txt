[SPEAKER_00]: doing this for yourself, this shit's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you got to go into dry sift with
the mentality that the yields are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: suck and you're going to work hard to
figure it out and it might take you a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a lot of material,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're the type of dude that has
like a half a pound of material and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all you got and you want to make sift with
it, I'd probably prefer you learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make water hash just because it's more
fail safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, it also is big time the
material.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kid just happens to be the kid that
has the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone thinks they have the fire until
they try to make full melt dry sift and
[SPEAKER_04]: then they're like, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like why doesn't mine look like yours?
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, would you like to take that question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why doesn't mine look like yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: My voice is really bad today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a cold so I'm not sure how this
is going to work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuban, that was exactly right.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have a whole bunch of good
product to work with, don't even get
[SPEAKER_09]: started.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean you can do a little experiment to
see what's possible, but you won't really
[SPEAKER_09]: get a lot of joy unless you've got a lot
to work with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water hash is very efficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the old techniques, it's really
efficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot easier for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like another thing I wanted to
touch up on, well not only do I get almost
[SPEAKER_00]: double the yields of water hash,
but the quality of the 45 that you make
[SPEAKER_00]: into rosin comes out as an actual
desirable nice yellow oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing that I've realized with
keif, if you just tumble a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: keif and you press it into rosin,
it never is going to be the same color as
[SPEAKER_00]: water hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always going to be a little darker,
lower grade I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked somebody and what they told me is
that the oil and the pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can actually leach contaminants on the
way out like chlorophyll and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and taint the color of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily green, but it won't be a
cellophane clear yellow or almost
[SPEAKER_00]: translucent, no color rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get up, so when you make the
sift, the only way to get a rosin the same
[SPEAKER_00]: color and comparable to water hash is that
you've got to make it 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why would you ever press 99% dry sift
into rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before, it's kind of dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just smoke the sift, it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the water hash, when you've got 45,
it's almost like that 45 is pure as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes beautiful oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 73 does too in all the grades above in
all those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you don't have a lot of
material, you get a lot more for your
[SPEAKER_00]: money, higher grade.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are sounding like a bunch of glue
heads, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're tasting more than is naturally
there, you're using too much.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's masking everything under it,
it's already good and you turn it into
[SPEAKER_04]: purple punch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that to say that because we extracted
the resins that we were doing too much and
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was naturally only supposed to be
done the way nature intended?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm not saying only the way nature
intended.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a reason for curing weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a reason for treating it towards
being a finished product rather than just
[SPEAKER_09]: jumping Q and making things out of fresh
weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: My voice is messed up because I got
cannabis cup wrong again or something,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I've been trying to stay away from
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fact that Tony's curing the
terpenes is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That he's not just capturing them fresh
frozen or whatever or fresh and then
[SPEAKER_04]: putting them out on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: He cures them out and they change the same
way they do on the plant or in the hash in
[SPEAKER_04]: the vial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that can be too, but let's leave
Tony out of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was talking about just the general
concept of what you guys are talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was forgetting you were talking about
Tony's product, but let's leave products
[SPEAKER_09]: out of this and get people out of it for
the moment unless they want to speak up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not here this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't see this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fascinating, but it can really be
overdone like anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not all terpenes are good.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a reason we aged our weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It became more smokable after a few weeks
or months depending on how you did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could also ruin it, but you could make
it better from the point of view of
[SPEAKER_09]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a smokable product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're talking about vaporizing,
but I'm not a big fan of that either.
[SPEAKER_09]: Call me old school, but it's not where I'm
at about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of challenge the overuse of it is
all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I'll say against that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of faith in my bioassay
ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a purist for a long time,
and I'm not in the state that generally
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't good for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been the one to be away from things
for years that I just felt like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You made that with a weird chemical
solvent and you don't know if you cleaned
[SPEAKER_04]: it all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried those things and felt sick from
them, gotten headache and turned green.
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know about this is it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you, Cuban?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be a turp head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a glue head, but I'm a turp head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it like this though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have hash that is like turpy
naturally, the way it comes, I won't mess
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting product to me to see
that somebody can extract the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell, the taste, the essence of the
plant into a little vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just cool to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfumery is an amazing field of research.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're talking about there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody still have any of the Swiss
flavoring oils left?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like see somebody put that terpene extract
onto something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That green heavy stuff?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, stuff that the guys had for
Switzerland 10, 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I have it in a little vial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't have any more of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see what that natural cannabis
extract from at the best ropa dope wasn't
[SPEAKER_09]: really heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hybrid stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: See what that would do as an experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to see somebody take hops
cones, take all the resin glands off of
[SPEAKER_09]: them, put some BHO that's just pure THC on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's easy enough to get and close to
pure THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then start experimenting with different
terpenes off the shelf on some neutral
[SPEAKER_09]: material like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we really after the terpenes or are we
after a complex mix of things?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we after?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have some double blind experiments.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met with Dave Pate last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hadn't seen him in years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave's a really smart guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not necessarily buying this terpene
thing at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm behind him on this too.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been no science.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me back up here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do these things right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do a little science.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get a double blind experiment that
shows these effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that's been done is cursory
work by David and me and a few other
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of launched this whole thing in a
way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to do some serious experimenting
and see what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is that it's a circular
problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know what to expect in terpenes,
so that's what we get.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we portray back onto what we
expect from terpenes, which is what we
[SPEAKER_09]: get.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not scientific.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's satisfying.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not scientific.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd really like to see some better work
with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm bucking for.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, take it easy with these
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of them have been approved for
ventilating, for breathing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not really approved for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because terpene compounds like
bergamot oil are allowed to stick on
[SPEAKER_09]: cigarettes doesn't mean they did any
research.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just means they wanted to sell
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing here to tell us that this
is safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing here to tell us that it's
effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all self-trait well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got his radar out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the same way for extracts,
for solvent and solventless extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at the terpene results in the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully Alec will be here soon to talk
about those results.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's with SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tested the milligrams per grams of
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the strains were as high as ones
that had terpenes added, but they never
[SPEAKER_04]: had terpenes added.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just a really rich, full
terpene-producing plant that got made into
[SPEAKER_04]: an extract the right way to preserve those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is, why not the worry for
all these years that people have been
[SPEAKER_04]: inhaling butane, solvent, extracts,
water extracts with potential microbials?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why haven't we 15 years ago said,
let's do the science on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why just now with terpenes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I interject something?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to ask Rob this.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a sense, are there mechanisms in the
chemical makeup of cannabis that combat us
[SPEAKER_05]: being exposed to light mold on
import-quality Mexican or Colombian?
[SPEAKER_05]: God knows when we were getting brickweed,
it didn't grow brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was rotting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we were exposed and we were all
lighting our bowls with our big lighters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone from the lab, I think it was
Addison, told me that that's got a trail
[SPEAKER_05]: of 8,000 ppm butane coming off of a low
temp flame lighter when we stick it in our
[SPEAKER_05]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mark has a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there things in chemicals and cannabis
that could have buffered that exposure to
[SPEAKER_05]: toxicity?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any faith at all in whole
plant medicines and whole plant healthcare
[SPEAKER_09]: products, the answer of course is yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: A complex herbal remedy or complex herbal
smoking mixture, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_09]: it, is going to have compounds that may
very well hurt you but may very well
[SPEAKER_09]: protect you as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: All you've done by making BHOs is take an
extract of the glands of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the other 90%?
[SPEAKER_09]: Whole herbal healing people who are
largely behind what is supposedly going on
[SPEAKER_09]: with medical cannabis are in shock about
extracts like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're whole plant extracts, sort of,
but there's no chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing that isn't either butane
or CO2 soluble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your techniques are limiting how much is
in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not doing anything near a whole
plant extract.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you're missing out on the
possibilities that there are things there
[SPEAKER_09]: that are going to ameliorate the effects
of smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: That cannabis smoking in its raw form
hasn't been bad for people.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smoking is bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tars are bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis smoking is good.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems to be what we're looking at
right now so far.
[SPEAKER_09]: The answer would be why.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a whole plant experiment that we've
done so far.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a shunt from that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water hash is really a whole plant extract
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: The gland heads are in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have some bits of leaf stock,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still much more closer to a whole
plant extract than solvent extracts are.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the beauty of solvent extracts too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I was going to ask about my deadly
allergy to hemp and the sub-allergies I
[SPEAKER_03]: have to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: What could be missing why I'm not allergic
to oils?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allergic to dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm less allergic to water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm deadly allergic to the flower rosin,
but I'm not allergic to solvent extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The argument goes both ways because when
you fractionally distill an oil into all
[SPEAKER_03]: its fragments and you see how many of them
are, when superheated, become noxious,
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole plant extract where you're going
to cook that all down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I will not pour the terpene
burnt content back into your THC and call
[SPEAKER_03]: that whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took it out and I can see that I
want it out of my room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once those terpenes were heated,
they all changed and they might not all
[SPEAKER_03]: change for the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was trying to standardize a product
versus every time I throw weed in,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's terpene explosion soup and it's never
the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say you're a unique case.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people don't need to refine their
cannabis so that it doesn't give them
[SPEAKER_09]: allergic responses.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're close to a unique case.
[SPEAKER_09]: First time I've ever heard this.
[SPEAKER_09]: For you, it's perfectly appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought so too until I started looking
up adverse emergency room reactions to
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it starts showing up in the comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people are like, what the fuck are
you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp is not allergic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost died.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a tablespoon of hemp protein and it
was getting kicked in the stomach for four
[SPEAKER_03]: hours every four minutes with a spike.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you're saying, you have an allergy to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most allergies are protein based,
so probably something like that in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to have, I'm not a
doctor, but you don't extract proteins in
[SPEAKER_09]: oils.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously whatever protein you're allergic
to, unless you have chunks of micro
[SPEAKER_09]: bacteria in there or something or other,
and there's proteins in those.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get things that are small that
have protein in them, but not cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would make sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water sift would still have it because
it's got the head cells in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their cells, so they have
proteins running around in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trace tiny amounts, but for allergies,
as you know, it doesn't take but a
[SPEAKER_09]: molecule really sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: For you, it's perfectly appropriate,
and so would be pharmaceuticals made from
[SPEAKER_09]: synthetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as just trying to seek relief,
I would think that they wouldn't cause the
[SPEAKER_09]: allergy problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I figured because I looked at
why – It's something that's not coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: in the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be another organism that lives on
cannabis that his body looks at as an
[SPEAKER_02]: attacking organism, and through an
allergen, antigen response, mast cell
[SPEAKER_02]: degranulation occurs, and he has an
allergic response.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Rob, what's up with the Phylos
Project?
[SPEAKER_09]: We presented Mowgli Holmes, the head of
Phylos Science, and I presented a workshop
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, I covered the new taxonomy a
little bit and tried to explain how it
[SPEAKER_09]: presents a model for us trying to figure
out the evolution of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: a hypothesis to hang real data on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mowgli's project is looking at the genetic
sequences, the genome sequences.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, about 1,500 dispensary samples,
and seeing how they're interrelated.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is part of the project.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what I've been looking for,
along with Sam the Skunk Man, is getting
[SPEAKER_09]: samples of land race varieties,
the basic building blocks that were used
[SPEAKER_09]: to make the Cincinnati varieties we have
today, the hybrid Cincinnati varieties we
[SPEAKER_09]: have today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we have these older samples from the
1970s and very early homegrown varieties,
[SPEAKER_09]: pre-Afghan, pre-Broadleaf drug varieties,
then we'll be able to put a time sense on
[SPEAKER_09]: this and see some of the beginning of the
evolutionary ideas corroborating some of
[SPEAKER_09]: the history we know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to be able to click
on your sample, for instance, in the
[SPEAKER_09]: database and see how it's related to other
samples in the database and how it was
[SPEAKER_09]: related to it ancestrally, see if your
hybrid variety has Thai or Colombian or
[SPEAKER_09]: Afghan and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the type of thing that one of
the things you can do with this sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: genome data.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm interested in the evolutionary
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Genome work might also be really
interesting for terpene breeding,
[SPEAKER_09]: because terpene breeding is difficult,
at least in comparison to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabinoids are basically a linear chain
of synthesis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have cannabidiol and THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both from the same precursor.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about the only split in the pathway
that we deal with on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know the enzymes for each of these
steps.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are multiple alleles of some of
these enzymatic steps, but they're pretty
[SPEAKER_09]: well understood.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're easy to breed for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Potency is super easy to breed for.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're breeding 411 alleles against
another allele.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terpenes are much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: They start with a number of basic
molecules.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have ramified pathways controlled by
lots of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_09]: More importantly, there are lots of
changes in the synthesis that are
[SPEAKER_09]: non-enzymatic.
[SPEAKER_09]: They happen due to heat and time and
things like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a much more difficult thing to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we see sweets of terpenes come
through in breeding, but they would be
[SPEAKER_09]: analogous to one branch of this
complicated synthesis, biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_09]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those seem to be pretty reproducible in
varieties, but we've also lost lots of
[SPEAKER_09]: unique aromas over the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every breeder has.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see it pop up once, and you breed that
plant, and it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that, and then, of course,
you have many, many terpenes instead of
[SPEAKER_09]: just a few cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aroma, the things that you're appreciating
particularly, or the effects that come
[SPEAKER_09]: from a suite of terpenes, not just one or
two, that's another aspect when you're
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to apply what you've bred to what
you've got and how you use it and how it
[SPEAKER_09]: affects patients or other users.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's really complicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Genetics can help with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could give us markers for some of these
terpenes that we'd be particularly
[SPEAKER_09]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rare ones, for instance, be able to screen
huge populations without growing them to
[SPEAKER_09]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_09]: All kinds of advances for breeding due to
genome work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it when you're focusing on initially a
particular genetic?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only interested in the evolutionary
pathways and what's really happened to
[SPEAKER_09]: make cannabis what it is today and try to
tie that into the human relationship with
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my interest, really.
[SPEAKER_07]: How far do you think man has been using
cannabis in conjunction?
[SPEAKER_09]: How long has man been using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: Humans?
[SPEAKER_09]: At least since the beginning of the
Holocene Epoch, 10, 12,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: How much before that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's cursory evidence.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe some of the fiber evidence that's
been found is actually cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: but there's no proof that it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably in the previous warm periods
before the Pleistocene, the last ice age,
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis was used as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really have any evidence of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you read Michael Pollan's book,
The Botany of Desire?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I kind of had a hand at writing at
least the cannabis chapter, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured you would.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of an interesting book,
the way he goes back with humans and looks
[SPEAKER_04]: at these important relationships,
these plants that we've taken with us and
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of popularized through our
relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and he got a lot of mileage out of
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's accessible, narrative, well-written,
ethno-botany, which is a field that most
[SPEAKER_09]: people don't know much about.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the relationship of ethno,
humanity, with botany, with plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like geography.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of these sort of all-encompassing
fields.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all tie together.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's ethno-geography and geographical
botany.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all related.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're cool fields.
[SPEAKER_09]: What he did was make this accessible to a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis was sort of the gateway plant of
the four chapters, I suppose, but potatoes
[SPEAKER_09]: and tulips and apples are important,
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all told the same story of how humans
interact with plants and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, of course, a great book.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing to build on what Rob's
saying is you have the flavor of the resin
[SPEAKER_08]: heads that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also noticed with breeding and
growing out large populations,
[SPEAKER_08]: the plant material has a distinct flavor
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've found strains where the resin smells
really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant's growing really great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I harvest the buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: They smell like what I want them to,
but the herb doesn't smoke right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew that clone several times after
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The herb just has a poor flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten strains that produce tiny
little black embryos in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew some land-raised Cambodian stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not seeds, but they're these
little, little tiny things.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll crackle and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only is there the terpenes that are
going to be—and extracts aside,
[SPEAKER_08]: of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're breeding for a plant that
tastes good, when you smoke the herb,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's the terpenes that are growing on the
plant and everything, but also how the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant material tastes can have a good or
bad influence, in my experience,
[SPEAKER_08]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rob's muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to unmute Rob.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the other 90% of the plant besides
the resin, so of course it's going to have
[SPEAKER_09]: its own flavors and tastes, unlike any
vegetable matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some are going to be good, and some are
going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate those little tiny nubs in some
varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're largely gone from our seedsy
varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, you'd think, man,
I got a seedless bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't get those things out there like
little pyramids.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't roll out like seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: They taste just as bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fun, especially when you get a
plant that has the terpene, the herb
[SPEAKER_08]: smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you break it up, and you're like,
okay, this is totally fucked for smoking
[SPEAKER_08]: herb from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just told me I sound stoned,
and I said, well, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working at it all morning,
trying my best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob, have you ever heard of this
compound called hashishine that this
[SPEAKER_02]: French group has isolated?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fascinating paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we talked about this in Hashchurch
about how a lot of the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, undergo all kinds of thermal
rearrangements, especially when you heat
[SPEAKER_02]: them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, what you see in the GC and what you
see at room temperature might be two very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: This group in France, this is a really
fascinating paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I put the link in the chat here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Identify this compound in several
different samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it was in all of the samples that
they tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a
5,5-dimethyl-1-vinylbicyclo-2-1,1-hexane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I look at it, it doesn't look like
something that would be stable even at
[SPEAKER_02]: nail temperature or even at rosin-making
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if this thing's actually
polymerizing in some way to make some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of polymerized version of this terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not widely reported on in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until this group in France reported on it,
I had not really heard of it coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a group in France that's basically
reported this as being a volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: constituent from many different samples
that they've looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never seen it before until this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering if you've ever seen
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a terpenoid, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's basically a thermal,
and they've actually come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms to account for not just this
compound, but several others that they
[SPEAKER_02]: found by their GC analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me post the link here so you can be
looking at the paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what will happen, the labs look
from probably eight to maybe 30 terpenes
[SPEAKER_09]: now that the labs can find.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all named terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the ones they can find standards
for.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the easy ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done analyses with perfume labs also
in France years ago, and they come up with
[SPEAKER_09]: 50, 60 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're named, and then a whole lot of
just numbered retention time peaks that
[SPEAKER_09]: they don't have names for, and there's
lots and lots of terpenes that don't have
[SPEAKER_09]: names from their source plant or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the harder we look in cannabis,
the more we're going to find, and some
[SPEAKER_09]: possibly unique to cannabis, although none
have been found yet that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my real question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis has this unique ability to smell
like almost every other plant on the
[SPEAKER_08]: planet, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You got pine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got fruits.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got almost everything out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it do that, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Most oranges all smell like oranges.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no blueberry orange or skunk
orange or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be possible, but people have done a
lot of breeding with other plants as well
[SPEAKER_08]: and haven't really gotten such a wide
range of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing to me that this plant's got
to have unique ones to it, because there's
[SPEAKER_08]: plants that smell like nothing else,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's cannabis plants that are unique to
cannabis, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are manifestations that happen at
the genetic level that, like Rob said,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the genes do is the genes express
proteins, and the proteins are essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: the cellular's machinery that basically
produces proteins or enzymes, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: also structural in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically creating all the
compounds, including the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Rob said, the unique thing about
cannabis in terms of its terpenoids is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's got this CBGA synthase,
which pre-nolates allotol of agacid,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a very unique bond formation in
the plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That creates the cannabinoid pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be that as it may, terpenes are
ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in all the fruit and food that we
eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, we can't get good
terpenes on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just open up your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason why Mother Nature would
make a unique set of phytochemicals for
[SPEAKER_02]: one plant and not use them economically
throughout the plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the same terpenes that are in
mints and the same terpenes that are in a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the mixture of those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like each individual molecule you
could think of as an instrument,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the different music that the orchestra
plays, which is what we end up feeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a function of the ensemble of many,
many different compounds and how they work
[SPEAKER_02]: together and how they work with our
individual receptors and our bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each individual one single terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I always laugh when people say
pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such thing as pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes are such a wide class of
molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: The molecules we're talking about is such
a very, very small fraction of
[SPEAKER_02]: phyto-terpenes that are derived from
cannabis and alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a very, very small fraction of
the total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their own god damn kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge collection of terpenes that
don't resemble anything like what's in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try to dab those, you'll probably
get really sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that I get asked all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are all these terpenes equal?
[SPEAKER_05]: When I get handed CO2 pens that are
clearly mixed with terpenes that may be
[SPEAKER_05]: found on cannabis, but were not derived
from cannabis, like the D-limonene thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When somebody handed me that and it
tasted, oh yeah, wow, tastes better than
[SPEAKER_05]: the CO2 oil did, but are these things
equal?
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have terpenes that are honestly
derived from cannabis, that's one thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's what's on the buds we
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we are now smoking essence of orange
degreaser from Florida chemists,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ponder.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't the same thing, is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The molecules are the same molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, whether or not they have some
residuals from where they came from could
[SPEAKER_02]: determine whether or not they can be
sweated out as, oh, that limonene came
[SPEAKER_02]: from orange peels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could talk to Horatio about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the low level decontaminant or
some of the contamination products,
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroperoxides and whatnot, can be noxious
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think you're just getting it in
too large a dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like standing right in front
of the tuba and let the tuba play.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just get this huge dose of tuba as
opposed to being in the back of the
[SPEAKER_02]: concert hall and listening to the tuba as
it plays along with the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: orchestra, which is a completely different
experience than sitting right next to the
[SPEAKER_02]: tuba and getting blasted out by the tuba,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love your analogies of music.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just exactly right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd's also talking about this quality of
the source material.
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, you can get aromatherapy oils
from more natural sources and things,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they've got to be better breathed than
keyboard cleaner.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's levels of limonene.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sitting here at the chateau level of
extracts and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking in the cerebral levels,
but you've got to remember that there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of people who the best thing they can
get is some lousy CO2 extract with some
[SPEAKER_09]: keyboard cleaner put in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: People actually do smoke this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to we need some regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to get slightly political again,
but we need regulation for these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't let snake oil salesmen run around
and poison us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked Rob the turkey in question about
if we could use it as indicators of NCOA.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're trying to do with the Phylos
project is work on genome sequencing,
[SPEAKER_09]: or differences in the genome to genetic
content of different plants, different
[SPEAKER_09]: individuals, because that's what we're
really looking at.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabinoids have been used for this for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the chemotaxonomic marker that
was first used.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of labs used that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Carl Hillig added to this at Indiana
University.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the early 20th century.
[SPEAKER_09]: Published in 2004 and five.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the characters he used besides
cannabinoids and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: He used terpenoids as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: He used also isozymes.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are enzyme variations.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the direct gene products or nearly
direct gene products of genes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the molecules that do the active
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: They express the genes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They look to variations in those.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another way of chemotyping or using
chemicals to do taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chemotaxonomy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the new way, of course, is with genome
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are useful taxonomically.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't steal other people's thunder,
and they haven't managed to publish yet,
[SPEAKER_09]: so I'll just hint around.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are terpene classes that have been
identified.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are looking at the major terpenes,
not the entire profile, but the most
[SPEAKER_09]: prominent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: How much can I say here without saying too
much?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're heritable.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all very interesting, and a paper
will be out soon that talks about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other hand, for taxonomic use,
they're very difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: For the same reason Sarashia and
everybody's explaining about differences
[SPEAKER_09]: in part of a grow room being hot or cold
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: The profiles of terpenes probably don't
change as much as the absolute amounts,
[SPEAKER_09]: but the problem with that is terpenes are
of varying volatilities.
[SPEAKER_09]: Profiles change if all the mono-terpenes
are gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're more likely to see that you have
the same general profile, at least of the
[SPEAKER_09]: prominent cannabinoids, and the other ones
vary more by epigenetic, environmental,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: For taxonomic characters, they're a little
bit dodgy.
[SPEAKER_09]: This won't be stealing anybody's thunder,
and I waited today until somebody from SC
[SPEAKER_09]: Labs came in, but they didn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a very fascinating paper in my hand
here that I would like to share with
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: SC was involved, so I was going to wait
for them to get it, but it's really a
[SPEAKER_09]: paper primarily out of Nolan Kane and
Brian Lynch's lab at University of
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado Boulder.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're genome guys, and they've managed
to put together a number of data sets for
[SPEAKER_09]: mostly drug varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have one Chinese hemp variety,
what would be broadleaf hemp, maybe sort
[SPEAKER_09]: of an out group in the experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done a really interesting job
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on a cursory level.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to match data sets.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the first people to use the
NLD-BLD nomenclature that Mark Rowland and
[SPEAKER_09]: I developed from Karl Hillings' work and
John McPartland's and others.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting to see that more of a
genome look at the taxonomy rather than
[SPEAKER_09]: just individual relationships.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a cool paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Steve Pill did the analyses of
cannabinoids and terpenoids in many of the
[SPEAKER_09]: samples, and that was taken into account
also, so back to the use of terpenes in
[SPEAKER_09]: taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the lightest overlay of the paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: It mentions relationships rather than
general relationships rather than
[SPEAKER_09]: fine-tuning things.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of where we're at with
terpenes and taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_09]: This paper is called Genomic and Chemical
Diversity in Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just came out last week.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's put on BioR14 preprint.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what journal this is actually
in.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a preprint copy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a manuscript copy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just search Genomic and Chemical Diversity
in Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the quotes already?
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ryan Lynch, L-Y-N-C-H, is the primary
author.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nolan Kane is the last author.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's his lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: All these labs are doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had this tremendous—Mowgli and I gave
our little presentation about taxonomy and
[SPEAKER_09]: the Phylos project, and then Mowgli and I
sat the next day on Sunday on what they
[SPEAKER_09]: call the genetics panel discussion,
moderated by Michael Bacchus, a real smart
[SPEAKER_09]: guy, and one of his colleagues,
Ryan Lee, was sitting on the panel as
[SPEAKER_09]: well, another real smart guy and a breeder
known as Chimera, to many of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on this panel were three really
awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Mowgli Holmes from Phylos
Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's John Page from University of
British Columbia, and I believe I got the
[SPEAKER_09]: affiliations right, and Kevin McKernan
from Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all three more extremely bright
guys, and they're all working hands-on
[SPEAKER_09]: with the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish we'd invited Nolan Kane as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a really good level of science
on many fronts at the Emerald Cup this
[SPEAKER_09]: year.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really refreshing to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of panels about serious
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just political, which is a big issue
in California right now, but also the
[SPEAKER_09]: science front.
[SPEAKER_09]: What these guys basically explained was
that it's not a big search for genes,
[SPEAKER_09]: at least not within this group.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a big search for intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_09]: There will come a time when you can patent
cannabis plants in America under the
[SPEAKER_09]: system we already have.
[SPEAKER_09]: There may come a time before that when our
industry develops its own patenting
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_09]: What this is about is making gene
sequences from cannabis open source to
[SPEAKER_09]: bring them into public domain.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's happened naturally for
years and years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Growers are proud, breeders are proud of
their new varieties, and to share them
[SPEAKER_09]: with their friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: That instantly makes them public domain.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are very few cannabis varieties that
people have kept close to the chest whose
[SPEAKER_09]: wives have said to them 10 years ago,
don't give this to anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: All well-meant, all very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're about is making it public
domain so that it's everybody's,
[SPEAKER_09]: not anybody's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Meaning that it's for the entire
community, and nobody can cubbyhole that
[SPEAKER_09]: and say, it's mine only.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that could be anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be agribusiness, that could be
big pharmas, people choose to call it,
[SPEAKER_09]: or it could be you, the breeder,
some individual person.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very sticky, difficult,
slippery slope, really.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a lot of money to defend your
intellectual property rights through the
[SPEAKER_09]: patenting system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And long and short of it, if a big company
wants to steal it from you, you can't
[SPEAKER_09]: really outgun them anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have more resources than you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a better way to protect is what is
presently being called defensive
[SPEAKER_09]: intellectual property rights protection,
and that is nearly free.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just submit varieties to a group that
is going to publish those sequences.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any one of these groups might be able to
help you with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Filos Bioscience certainly is.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also sponsoring something called the
Open Cannabis Project, and that is exactly
[SPEAKER_09]: that, an open forum for not only
publishing gene sequences, but also
[SPEAKER_09]: discussing sticky issues like what is a
cush, or things of this nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with more genetic evidence,
we have more ways to entertain this
[SPEAKER_09]: discourse about what varieties are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to see something that's all
suggested openly now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see why not, it's not that big an
idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see a forum set up by the Open
Cannabis Project that is set up like Hash
[SPEAKER_09]: Church, because this works so well,
this is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_09]: You begin possibly with people weighing
in, maybe Sam the Skunk Man can talk about
[SPEAKER_09]: what skunk number one is, some knowns,
as you would say in a scientific
[SPEAKER_09]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ease into this, talk about the Hayes,
talk about some other ones that are older
[SPEAKER_09]: building blocks, things with histories
that are quite known, or if they're
[SPEAKER_09]: controversial, at least they can be
resolved by somebody who was there,
[SPEAKER_09]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a forum like this would be good,
it would keep people from getting fights
[SPEAKER_09]: in the back of the room, and once people
see what's going on with the old standard
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties, and maybe if you land race
discussions, even then you can get into
[SPEAKER_09]: the fuel, you can get into the fire,
you can get into all the stuff you guys
[SPEAKER_09]: are all wise, whizzed out about.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much the intellectual
property rights things, some terpenes,
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and two, Rob's only here for a
couple more hours, and he flies away,
[SPEAKER_07]: so he made his flight later so he could
join us, which I thought was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much, Rob and Todd.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always appreciate when you help bring
those guys in, when you help facilitate
[SPEAKER_04]: them to be able to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do appreciate it, and I know
everyone else does as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to come say goodbye to you,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: My pleasure to be here, a little bit rough
voice today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe next Sunday too, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll try to keep the conversation up
to par for Bubba Robb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a high level of knowledge,
it's excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.
