[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a celebratory hit for Mr. Mark
Emery who entered the country apparently
[SPEAKER_01]: at about 20 minutes after four today East
Coast time in Windsor, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say I'm pretty
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty happy to have him back here in
BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've missed him for the last five years
not being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be very nice for him to get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that the people down at Cannabis
Culture and PawTV, Jody and Jeremiah and
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole team down there haven't been
doing absolutely amazing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know with Mark back at the helm
things are going to be strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with them not having to focus as much
attention on making sure he's okay and
[SPEAKER_01]: having Jody go visit him, I think they're
going to be able to really do a lot in
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to, you know, taking down the
conservative government in the least and
[SPEAKER_01]: as always promoting ethical cannabis laws,
which would really pretty much be no law
[SPEAKER_01]: at all if we're going to go the ethical
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be back here in Vancouver on
August 17th.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Sunday, David Melmoldaveen I saw on
Facebook has posted that they're having a
[SPEAKER_01]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Victory Square, which is right
across the street, kitty corner pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much from the Marijuana Party bookstore,
the Vapor Lounge, CCHQ, the Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: Cafe, all of those places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be really great if you've got
time and you're in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to see you down there to support
Mark on his return home back to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to just be a really
amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely try and pull Mark aside
for a little short interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he's going to be ridiculously busy
and I almost hate to do it to him,
[SPEAKER_01]: but things have changed in the last five
years and that's something that now I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know my audience is going to want to
hear from Mr. Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll make a point on having a de-nail
dab session with him, some dry sift,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll get a few questions out of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, this particular video today is
funny enough directed back at a gentleman
[SPEAKER_01]: I met in Jamaica through giddy-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Colorado, who I met through Tony from
River Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so giddy-up introduced me to his
friend Bird while I was in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_01]: recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird was just an awesome all-around
character, super fun to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out we actually have some
business to do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gifted me one of these Apex electronic
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me it had a four-day battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't believe him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually had a five-day battery for me
using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite often I really enjoyed it and liked
it showed it to quite a few friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some pretty good hits in regards to
for a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was giving me hits that were more
attuned to it to a rig or a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told him I was going to order some
and put them on my store on my shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know Bird being the
top-notch guy that he is, he sends me
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was my order, even though
it didn't look like it could possibly be a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what Bird sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so got the Apex bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just basically a real,
you know, standard schwag bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at first I was kind of confused as to
why he was sending me these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sent me, let's see if we can get
this all in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a great desk with these pull-out
drawers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me another bag that's basically
full of, let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even opened this stuff,
so I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a cigarette roller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joint roller, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess just kind of a little schwaggy-dag
kick-down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if you're not getting,
he's got the Apex hats, which I'm wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like he gave about ten of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he put in ten Apex t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten Apex t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then of course he put in ten Apex
pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the little, oh, my light is
bouncing off the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the little top here,
the little cancer symbol, breast cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness symbol.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess that one's for the ladies,
or for the gentlemen that like pink,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sent a bunch of different other
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gold in here, there's silver,
there's kind of a black.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent packs and packs and packs of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little silicone, much like oil slick,
but just kind of his little version that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a whack load of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little Apex zipper packages to put
everything that comes with the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, being the kind guy that he
is, he said to me, he said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to give one to your buddy Mike
that was on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to give one to Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to give one to D420K.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of got the idea that I would
gift about five of them out to people that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had on my show, guests and friends of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought I would also,
and I'm not exactly sure how we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but we'll do a little giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll start with this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bag will include a hat, a t-shirt,
an Apex pen, a packet of the silicone
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, a zipper pouch,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I guess these chargers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes with chargers as well as Oh,
the little sticky twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well throw one of those in there
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we just have to figure out how we
can go about making this contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about maybe making it about
sharing this video and then showing me how
[SPEAKER_01]: many shares you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know how we can do it,
but maybe you guys have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm open to whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give one of these away for
starters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give away the other ones as
requested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I just want to show you guys
back of the love that Byrdz showed me,
[SPEAKER_01]: the generosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have these up on the site,
but it would be nice to give away a few
[SPEAKER_01]: even before they arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So post this video on your Facebook
account.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one with the most shares takes home an
Apex pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound fair?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it sounds fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my Facebook page is
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbleman.freshheadies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get in touch with me through
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know or aren't able to find
that account, you can get a hold of me
[SPEAKER_01]: through bubbleman at bubblebag.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can send me a link to your
Facebook page showing me this video posted
[SPEAKER_01]: on your Facebook page and shared as many
times as it could possibly be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope, and gals, I hope one of you guys
takes home an Apex pen here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to thank Byrdz again for
the generosity for making all this
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the next time I do it,
I'll do it with a set of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why haven't I been doing this earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it take a good buddy's generosity
to kick me into gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know, but let's all thank Byrdz
that he did because bubbleman's world is
[SPEAKER_01]: about to get a lot more fun with the idea
that you could win some pretty cool things
[SPEAKER_01]: just by watching and sharing a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, I'm going to finish it
off with another quick rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit the Apex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well hit the Apex.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I like about the Apex is
that I can really pack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was always very gentle with my
trippy stick because, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to mess with the element,
which I would suggest that you are very
[SPEAKER_01]: careful with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just cool that one of the things that
Byrdz decided to do is make his element so
[SPEAKER_01]: strong that digging around or messing with
it, you know, with your fingers or a small
[SPEAKER_01]: tool isn't going to really put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is for you, Charlie,
but it's also for Byrdz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Redlock barefoot activists are called out
to test their mettle against the new ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: boy scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had success, but not like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He collected cannabis, cannabis activists
fingers and made them into a fist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Uncle Sam has ingested marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm cruising with the bubble man to
meet the prince of pot got the poor and
[SPEAKER_02]: the full melt stashed in the truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they want to send them in exile for
spreading the seed to people in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: that need a crib weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Uncle Sam has ingested marijuana in
the form of mercury.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cloudy haze that hovers at head
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a few breaths and get your head
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can I want the table space bag and
play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Uncle Sam has ingested marijuana in
the form of mercury.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the uncle is going to start
feeling things a little bit differently,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffing on a tricone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you send them on home?
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffing on a tricone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffing on a tricone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffing on a tricone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
