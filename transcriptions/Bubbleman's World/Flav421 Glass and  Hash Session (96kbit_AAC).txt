[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is another beautiful day here in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 11 o'clock a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got off the deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see my good friend Flav421.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently he's got some new motherships
in the house that I need to go see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go down there and have a
little mothership session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more importantly than that,
I've got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like just a bag that I picked up
at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, what it truly is,
is an unbelievable collection of genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that could take some a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Flav's going to get them all in a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what we're giving Flav today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got from the good guys at True
Genetics, Phil, we got the sweatband,
[SPEAKER_00]: the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to share it when you get wonderful
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm going to give Dave the
sweatband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work that's gone into it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a good friend, so I want him to
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried and true Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give him the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell, the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys even saw this
Astro Boy bud that I just chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got that just curing away in a drawer with
a bunch of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to be giving Flav the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this came via Doc Atomic from Reefer
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a Reefer Man strain,
the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw a couple of little calyxes
that were on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was stressed and I guess went
into a bit of flower before Doc gave it to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had these calyxes with resin on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw those in there just to give Flav a
little taste of what this actual nug
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Great Gardener, Matt, the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on, that's a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin production on this thing,
I don't care what else you have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, this starts producing resin first
and it continues to produce resin last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Barb is essential to have in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Great Gardener genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't given this one out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remo gave this one to me when I went there
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave him Sweet Skunk Congo and Astro
Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me the UBC Chemo Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's from Remo and that's going to
Flav421.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, this was a gift again from Phil from
the guys at True Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe from his new partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's where it came from,
but Old School Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember this strain from the 90s and I
gotta tell you, I'm pretty damn excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in the Astro Boy, the Apollo 13
crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smacked the Ortega C99 cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the Pure Ortega right there
going to Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Doc Atomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't just give a reefer man strain away
via Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta give Doc strain away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that he picked out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him for his most special one and I
gotta say this one reeks lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Doc Atomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the Always, oh, what would you call
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would we call this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is, this one causes trouble when
you share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no more special than any of the ones
I just went by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it is special and we do love it,
it's the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a couple of Congolese cuts going
to Flav421 because unlike some,
[SPEAKER_00]: we believe that it is a strain that should
be shared as all the strains are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really understand the whole rule
thing on strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should reiterate that the strain was
given to me 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to have this strain and I was
even told by Reyna Ginga that she didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mind if I had this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never given any rules in regards to
this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to reiterate that I'm not
one to go fuck around and cause problems
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just believe that a special strain like
that should be available to people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: in need of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Flav421, it's coming your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but certainly not least, and this one
I'm gonna have to go out on a limb as
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it's the rarest of all that I just
went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is the 20 year old lamb's
bread that I popped just a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy right here, there's three of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is rooted and two were freshly cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be very exciting to see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really quite excited to see what we
get produced out of that lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some other Jamaican strains going
but this one is the only one I have that's
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years old and I'm very excited to get
it over the flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess all that is left is to take a
nice big rip and make our way down to see
[SPEAKER_00]: Flav421 and check out these motherships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta tell you, when Flav421 calls me
and says you gotta come by and we gotta do
[SPEAKER_00]: a video on these new pipes I got,
I'm like alright, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hitting the tie nail with the ceramic
insert, you probably can't really see it
[SPEAKER_00]: there but I assure you it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the dabber clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we better do one more before
we head out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's gonna be tough puffing over
there so we might as well start it out
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always excited to go to Flav's and hit
sick glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick glass, I mean the guy just has the
most ridiculous collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright well, let's go deliver us some
strains to Flav, shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well guys, I made it to Flav's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with Flav421 and man,
you got a nice little selection of glass
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thought I'd bring on a couple pieces that
we hadn't hit in a while and I think a few
[SPEAKER_01]: of these aren't even on film.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this Marcel's not on film.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this punty, the Alice tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The custom Man United punty tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: This beautiful new JXC, which is honestly,
it's one of my faves right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a nice piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit that on your birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely down to rip that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this, which is one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my wife's piece but this Marcel tube
that was done for the other part of High
[SPEAKER_01]: Integrity Glass Art and was gifted to me a
little later on but this Marcel piece is
[SPEAKER_01]: just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a beauty man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really unique stuff that you don't see on
a Marcel pipe all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The huge circled sections with the ready
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a nice, we'll set it up in the
sunlight and I'll make sure to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: it and show each piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I obviously brought you some gifts
so I would like for us to each have a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely ripping this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm ripping this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FTK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some beeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to split it into two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought out some of the Seedman's Haze
that I did and some of the older MK Dry
[SPEAKER_01]: Sip that you cleaned for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some Astro Boy that I... Oh,
lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wafered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you hit that and maybe I'll
hit some of your MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the 99 cleaned heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some beeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, this is going to get me right
little...
[SPEAKER_00]: Right little... What a beautiful piece,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those older Marcel Bubbs are just
some of my faves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the styles, some of the guys like
Marcel and Jason Lee and Clinton Roman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the art, the sculpture work,
just the lines, the color choices,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just so perfect in every way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cheers brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puddle to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should also note that you have a bloody
World Cup trophy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing weighs serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a life size... Like is this 30
pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to have it on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flav collecting the World Cup trophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only English fan to actually hold for the
World Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 150,000 euros, it could be yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't tell the Germans because they're
still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't tell the Germans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the Germans after you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Germans are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, got this bag at the Bob Marley Museum
on my last trip to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought what better way to bring you
these treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: More gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we start with the Jamaican Lamb's
Bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fully rooted one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with about eight inches of roots
hanging off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two fresh cuts.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, the ever elusive Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two fresh cuts of the Congolese for you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this would be a nice thing for you
to have come at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're friends with the Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doc dropped these off a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a month and a bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is his pick, the NL, the Doc
Atomic NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two nice cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these cuts are very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I looked after Doc's,
some of Doc's plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while when he was on holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out searching for some new lamb races and
whatnot in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up finding them in Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ortega from True Genetics from Phil
Pearson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys seem to be doing some really
nice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have the right set of
foundation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a special one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Naponica.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are special ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple from Remo, the UBC chemo
kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, veg it longer and you will get
bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like substantially bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bubble Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right from Remo, we go to Matt,
the great gardener, the Barbara bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two fresh cuts of the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those ones were on a mother that had
been outside quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dipped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see anything, but some of the
leaves looked a little funky to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only one you might have to
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are as clean as a whistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came via Docatomic from Reeferman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually put a couple of little.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fun because I wanted to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put those in your hand for a sec and
give those a squeeze and smell those.
Harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could sing without Harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that ridiculous though?
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally was like searching the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I gotta find one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I accidentally rimmed one off and
then I smelt my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you gotta be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not dank?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has such a nice sweetness to it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be something to enjoy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right behind that TGA genetics,
the Astro boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm going to give you the Astro
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an F1 of Phil Pearson's true
genetics sweat band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the sweat band.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the nine days of Hanukkah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I give you nine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never a bad thing to share your
genetics, especially if you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you're sharing them with are
righteous people who are looking to also
[SPEAKER_00]: get the genetics out there or just grow
the genetics and use it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you might want to put them in
your fridge for the time being or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll definitely be good in there for a
bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to get to sampling
the wares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: On from sampling the strains to sampling
the borough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after an epic genetic giveaway or an
epic genetic give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'm feeling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I borrow a flame?
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Alice piece by Panty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was done when he was still at the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Seedman?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is my personal favorite Panty
piece, but only because I'm such a giant
[SPEAKER_01]: United supporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glory, glory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's to things you've never seen
together.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I ever won?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is for nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for just a club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So England has won the world cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world cup in 1966.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pick a bunch of people from their
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the United players on the team.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a big footy fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I respect the fact that you are.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Manchester United.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I remember even when you got
this, how stoked you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In life, my most cherished things on this
planet are family, United, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm under United.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: My love for myself is even under my love
for United.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should pack it up with a little bit of
dry sift that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's like an apple a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: An apple a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, feed your endocannabinoid system and
keep the doctor away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got to keep that system
fully fed, fully charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had quite a few people talk to me in the
locker room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last couple of days with loved ones
that are just being told that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly harsh cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people to go to the Facebook page,
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me to be a very good source of
as much of that information as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people also that just to consume
it, to eat cannabis, to get it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: body, whether it's the extract or the oil
or the hash or the bud, that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: start right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is more of a euphoric,
enjoyed feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens our minds to the fact that we do
also need to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consume a little bit of it every day in
coconut oil infused hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put creams on my arm and my back where I
have pain from broken bones with CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many other ways too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely, yeah, it's a good thing
to feed your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in more ways than just combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In more ways than just combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my god, if you're going to do it with
combustion, you might as well do it this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly picked the most beautiful,
ridiculous pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go on this guy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcel, here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can toke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pack and I'll lay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this one's just more enjoyable to
hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have others do the work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift, some of this sift, some of this
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try a little bit of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, the Astra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a little patty in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arms length.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does your wife use this pipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: She handles it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's a big rage,
you know, for all the smaller tubes and
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller pieces, but there's just something
about a large piece like this that's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could imagine being so much harder to
keep from cracking in the kiln,
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of the kiln you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, from big to tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little chip work mini Carlson,
surely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way he put this together, the
constriction points are very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a big bong, it does not feel like a
huge bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really feels like it's tight and it's
small in there, not this huge open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you know, as we start to smoke
less of the herb, or none of the herb in
[SPEAKER_00]: my case, and all concentrates,
the better the concentrates are,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just seem to appreciate them more
through a smaller piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I actually do agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although this is a big piece,
it's not really that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: The restriction in it, yeah, it's got a
nice chug to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the restriction is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering there's like a half liter of
water in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well that's probably the key right
there, not leaving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring that right up to the top here,
I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love visiting Flav.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting glass like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little guy, as you can see,
put your hand behind it and then pulled it
[SPEAKER_00]: up close to the camera and it'll grab it
real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show it in the sunlight as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty damn nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such beautiful pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they really are just beautiful,
beautiful, artistic pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcel's just obviously, you know,
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just OG and he's just, in a sense,
the same way mothership is on another
[SPEAKER_00]: level, I find Marcel to be on another
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just completely on different
levels from the majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That jake seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marble on the back is hollow and it
shows the water line of the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: How high is the water right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in the disk.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to put a little more or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this jake seed is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that the mothership crew is doing
now is... Man, that little coral sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always such a pleasure to be around such
beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monty, Marcel, Marcel, Fab Klein Taurus
from Mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monty Manchester United.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's coming back with that,
what do you call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a jake seed mini straight valve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jake seed mini straight valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way he's got this up high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just boom, everything's attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fixed bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: No slides, no everything's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I don't know the lingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like when I'm learning it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called fixed bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can admit my ignorance in regards to
your knowledge in the glass scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep me updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of my eyes and my ears.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall we dab it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some melty goodness and some heat
and we're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the hit on this one actually is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the better hitting pieces
that I've acquired more recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darn tootin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit a little, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did forget my carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kaoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to give us reasonable hits
so we don't need the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that when you put a bigger one in
that the carb cap is extremely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just hitting nice little one
bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right on the bottom there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it did okay though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh that is fucking tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I wished I would have
brought you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave something for next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soon becoming one of my favorites in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the Afghani and the Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the Barb obviously has the Afghani
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thicken up faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce resin quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Boy produces resin very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Astro Boy makes ... I mean it's all about
the resin farming, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean the ones that create the great
resins, Astro Boy has always been great
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always made such good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, has it ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you have a pretty healthy
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To add to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing what you do with
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's certainly plans in the
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little bit of the star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure has a nice bouquet on it,
hey?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard for me to pinpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to pinpoint.
The smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of caramely, but like
[SPEAKER_01]: evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's something really nice in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smooth though, caramely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely smells ... Like burnt
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long of a flush did you do on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like three weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four weeks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all from a plant that was in a big
20 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't wait to ... I have this
going from the clone you gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed to keep it alive while I was
away in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife kept it alive, so that was
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rooted and transplanted and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should start producing into a little plant
here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of other tents that are
blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be a little bit slow on the
blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're blooming, but they're sativas,
so they're at two weeks or three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look like they're at one week or
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 10 to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean some of them have a good two
and a half months left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 10 weeks even longer, depending on
some of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have in the other tent, one's just
pure sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's East Coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Congolese, and it's sweet skunk.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one I have a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have John's My Little Pony in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Jamaican, the first one that I'm
blooming with a Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm awesomely excited to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the most amazing looking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but just because.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the history of it, from the seed to
how long it was sitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not we're going to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not all the people I gave that
cut to are going to be like, oh,
this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just excited to see it, because
you're the first one to have flowers from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple other strains in with
those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some other things I can't remember
off the top of my head, but I think an
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani and a Barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's always nice to have one of
those in each.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't believe it for a half of it
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that Barb really produces resin like
you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we're going to continue on
and puff some bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a nice sort of line up of
all the pipes in the sun with the video
[SPEAKER_00]: camera so you get a real nice breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, as always, it's a pleasure,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me over, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now really the last...
[SPEAKER_01]: So now really the last... So now really
the last...
