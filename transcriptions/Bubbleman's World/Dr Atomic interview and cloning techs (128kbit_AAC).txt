[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a super special guest today.
[SPEAKER_05]: My good friend Dr. Atomic is in the house
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, good to have you here, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Atomic and myself have known each
other for 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've both been, I mean, he's been at it
longer than I have, growing cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember hearing about him when I first
came to BC in the early 90s, when we first
[SPEAKER_05]: linked up with Emery and Hilary and all
those guys at Hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess you, yeah, give us a little
bit about your history, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've always been a fan of the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it was always about quality,
not about money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about how high I could get,
not about how much money I could make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, the money came later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it seems when you have the passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might add that in my travels since I was
18 years old, I've been to virtually every
[SPEAKER_04]: major cannabis centre in the world,
including Katam in Morocco, Balbek in
[SPEAKER_04]: Lebanon, Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan,
Northern Pakistan, Kashmir, Nepal,
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Thailand, Southern India,
all over India for that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: In search of the best weed I could find.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is something that I know for a fact
right now that the viewers watching,
[SPEAKER_05]: even I got goosebumps when you said all
those spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't myself even been to all those
spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to one day say that I've been to
all the major cannabis and hash producing
[SPEAKER_05]: countries in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's interesting because each one
has its unique profile and also the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment in which you consume it has an
effect on how you feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came to learn that and then when the
world of hybridization came around,
[SPEAKER_04]: the possibilities were endless because we
could combine multiple strains or a few or
[SPEAKER_04]: any combination thereof and wind up with
another experience and we keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's a question for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: When in your collection, like when you
were collecting seeds in these countries,
[SPEAKER_05]: were you collecting initially to grow for
you and your friends or were you right
[SPEAKER_05]: away initially thinking I'm going to
collect these and save them and eventually
[SPEAKER_05]: one day?
[SPEAKER_04]: I collected them because I wanted to grow
them and have the best marijuana to smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: myself and for my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my sole purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no business interests at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was strictly from a, I hate to use the
word, but a spiritual point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it always had a spiritual aspect
to it and for that reason, the higher I
[SPEAKER_04]: got, the less business-like I became.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was only later on when I hooked up with
people who were more business-minded to
[SPEAKER_04]: get that part of it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank God that they did really
because you know you say it like it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: bad word, but at the same time the
business end of it is how the people
[SPEAKER_05]: gained access to your strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, but because of my nature,
I wasn't that type of guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you know what, that's why when we came
together I think almost 12 years ago and
[SPEAKER_05]: we made our first batch of bubble together
which we're going to share some photos in
[SPEAKER_05]: this video of when the Doc and I got
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was kind of a special time we got
together to make this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean he brought a pound or two of this
beautiful bud, all different varieties and
[SPEAKER_05]: he was like let's run this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, particularly it was the blueberry
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made a 73 micron golf ball or a little
bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was absolutely full melt beauty that I
brought to Natal.
[SPEAKER_04]: To Shiva Ratchery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is Shiva's birthday for those of you
that don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Baba Woodstock, Puffer's
Central.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in 2002 and if you went 30 years
younger than that to 1972, I was actually
[SPEAKER_04]: smuggling hash from Nepal to Canada,
but this was before there was an indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: grow scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 30 years later I'm bringing it back to
Nepal and offering it to these Shivaites,
[SPEAKER_04]: to these holy men and saying here I
created this in a room with no windows
[SPEAKER_04]: with high pressure sodium lights and then
I threw the product in ice water and mixed
[SPEAKER_04]: it up and here's the result and they
looked at me kind of dumbfounded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well and then my American friend in Nepal
happened to have a double bubbler and I
[SPEAKER_04]: said here why don't you try this out of a
double bubbler and throw that mediocre
[SPEAKER_04]: hash with the cheap tobacco in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was Mark who I introduced you to.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, Mark Rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's my manufacturer, Acme Manufacturing
and the Doc's even wearing a wild fibers
[SPEAKER_05]: jacket right now from him as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a hemp wild fibers jacket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to fulfill the full circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys got to hit that full melt
bubble that we made from your indoor grown
[SPEAKER_05]: nuns in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you not even in the Shivaite cave?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were in the cave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was said to them here were all these
high level babas and their bells and beads
[SPEAKER_04]: and orange and dreadlocks and people
kissing their feet and I was the new
[SPEAKER_04]: shaman came to town with a t-shirt and
jeans on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know and I told them I wear my dreads
on my heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't your first rodeo.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I love the fact that simultaneously
while the Doc was blowing minds with the
[SPEAKER_05]: babas in Nepal in Kathmandu I was in
Jamaica during the exact same time in
[SPEAKER_05]: February and it was Bob Marley's birthday
bash and I had some of that same beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: I called it the stained glass window.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get the ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a different piece that was quite
thin and really nice full melt and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: literally blowing minds at the Bob Marley
bash in St. Anne's in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me it was one of the most
fulfilling things of my life to have these
[SPEAKER_04]: high level babas taking them to a new
level with full melting glass comparing it
[SPEAKER_04]: to mediocre hash and cheap tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just no comparison and they were
amazed and continued to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me that was very fulfilling in
spite of the risks I took bringing it
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, crazy risks.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day we'll look back when this plant is
legal all over the world and we're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: access it and travel with it that there
should have never been those risks in the
[SPEAKER_05]: first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say this is the first time
I've ever been on camera and the reason
[SPEAKER_04]: being I'm now a medical exemptee as my
friend Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're legal in here in Canada to produce
and consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me it's kind of like after 40
years of paranoia coming out and being
[SPEAKER_04]: real and saying there's a real person
behind these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can attest this is the Dr. Atomic,
the one and only Dr. Atomic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's here with us today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay Mark, are we gonna make something
here?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna make some hash here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna be back in two minutes and
we're gonna make a little dry sip.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we are back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just took a little break there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We threw the urn.
[SPEAKER_05]: into these containers that the doc brought
over.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to tell us a little bit about
this herb?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just a mixture of the current
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the little nugs on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that are, you know, kind of a
pain to crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: The current line as in the current seeds
that are currently available?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the current seeds are currently
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are seedless.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some seeds in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically a blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: A sure dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very perfumey.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the main characteristics of the
sativa strain is its citrus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lemon fruitiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: With indicas you'll find more of a skunky
aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been a fan of sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find them more exciting, more uplifting,
capable of doing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not being couch locked.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lying around, watching horror movies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which has its place.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on a beautiful day like today,
give me a sativa any day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've got here is a blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we call it an atomic blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good friend Mark here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna process this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna use this a lot personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my own medical requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was saying before, this is the
first time I've been on camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm now legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a medical exemptee here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under federal law as is Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are who we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the safety to be able to share the
information and the knowledge and the
[SPEAKER_05]: experiences that we've had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it's getting to this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking off camera just before
filming this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The doc was kind of like, I don't ever do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, well you don't have to by
any means.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just remember, you are Dr. Atomic and
it's nice to let the sort of people out
[SPEAKER_05]: there that have been breeding your strains
or growing your strains and using these
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinally and recreationally for their
own selves for decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to say that you guys out
there, the ones that have sent me emails
[SPEAKER_04]: and said how good the result was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means as much as making the money that
we all make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only to survive, but that's another
matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: What matters to me is having as good a
cannabis in terms of seeds that I would
[SPEAKER_04]: want to grow myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't send you any less.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's my mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that it's legal, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to put a George Bush mask on
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for years I didn't show my face
and it was unfortunate that we sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: it's one more part of prohibition's
hindrance of change and of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to keep prohibition locked in.
[SPEAKER_05]: What better way than to have the people
that are trying to move prohibition out of
[SPEAKER_05]: power, have them have to hide themselves,
have them have to be secretive,
[SPEAKER_05]: have them have to be, you know,
non-trustworthy and worried about
[SPEAKER_05]: interacting with certain people or with
strangers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I feel super good nowadays that
when strangers approach me and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: like, hey, bubble man, I saw you on
YouTube or whatever, that I don't have any
[SPEAKER_05]: negative thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wonder like, oh my God,
I wonder if this is like an undercover or
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if this person's out to,
like I don't have those feelings anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it reminds me of a lyrics in a song
by Peter Tosh where he says, there ain't
[SPEAKER_04]: no need to smoke and hide because you're
taking a legal right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we are taking a legal right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a legal right for us to have this
medicine, which we are going to convert
[SPEAKER_04]: for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll smoke to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are, we've got a good little,
you know what, when the doc called me and
[SPEAKER_05]: said he had some more herbs that he wanted
to process and had been so long since the
[SPEAKER_05]: last time we did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you want to go about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, well, all of it, you know,
like let's dry sift and wet wash and
[SPEAKER_05]: coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this video is basically going to be
showing dry sifting, wet washing and
[SPEAKER_05]: coconut oil extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we're going to start with the
dry sifting because I've got the screen is
[SPEAKER_05]: literally sitting right here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the new screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still not up on the website.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, these are two foot by one
foot and they are a 90 and a 60 line per
[SPEAKER_05]: inch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm showing this to the doc for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little dry sift trick that we
learned online over at ICMAG originally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what it is, is the screens
are much larger than our regular dry
[SPEAKER_05]: sifting screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those screen numbers that I read off
were mesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 and 60 or lines per inch, but in
micron, which you'll understand better,
[SPEAKER_05]: this top screen is a 250 and this bottom
screen is a 180.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are very big holes for dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally we might dry sift with a 150 and
then just card over a 70, which is very
[SPEAKER_05]: counterintuitive to this process.
[SPEAKER_05]: What this process is, is a trick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real quick, cool trick to access a
real high percentage of glands outside of
[SPEAKER_05]: the contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we do is we take a little bit of
this herb, we just throw it across the
[SPEAKER_05]: screen, being as gentle as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's counterintuitive to be rough with
this particular process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what happens is everything's going
to fall and there's this quarter of an
[SPEAKER_05]: inch or half an inch gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the things that fall on this screen
get lodged in the holes, for whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: reason they get lodged.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll show all this with a macro
photograph because I do have my camera
[SPEAKER_05]: back now and I will be able to share macro
photographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what's on the bottom is a really
high percentage of gland heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we figured we'd take some of this high
grade docatomic material, sativa,
[SPEAKER_05]: do a quick bounce, make a little bit of
this dry sift, have a rip or two,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we're going to run a batch,
a 200 gram dry batch in one of the new
[SPEAKER_05]: prototype bags from Acme.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll run that through the bubble now
and we'll filter it through the eight bag
[SPEAKER_05]: kit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll come up with some beautiful bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I guess we'll get started right
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we get started with a rip?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like you need a rip here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well we'll do a little barb
hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the barb from yesterday that I
made the funny video of it not falling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just being silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is wild though because you see that
that's just powder, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how does that even?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first time I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like stuck in chunks.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't pressed hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Powder that tends to stick to itself very
nicely and presses instantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the quartz all cleaned and the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this your first time dabbing out of
these kind of rigs or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you not exposed to this much at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of an old school joint guy,
but more and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still a lot of young people hitting
joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean the joint is, it's almost just the
standard for getting turned on the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be weird if this is how you got
turned on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it looks like it's going to take off,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what's funny that you say
that because what is it called?
[SPEAKER_05]: The mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very, very nice bond.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flav421 sold to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just give you a little bit of it and
I'll finish it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just paint the rim a little bit for you
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half that dab just melted on contact with
the quartz rim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the great garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should meet for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll put that together.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys both sell your seeds,
I think exclusively for him as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: at the Vancouver Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rebecca from the Vancouver Seed Bank,
super trustworthy individual when it comes
[SPEAKER_05]: to buying your beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's definitely not selling beans that
aren't exactly what she says they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: She acquires most of each bean from,
I know you put those beans right in her
[SPEAKER_05]: hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I give them to her directly, directly to
her hand.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no middleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take full responsibility for every
bean that goes out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice when you don't have to have,
you know, that you're the buck stops here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to say that if they're ever as
occasionally, of course, there's maybe a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem of germination or it could be your
technique, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's never any question.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any problems, we'll gladly
replace your beans within reason,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, but guaranteed they're good
beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us some of the strains that are in
here in the new line.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the lemon tie, which is the tie
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I call it a little more lemony
this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still the tie lights.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the atomic haze, which is the
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, Cambodia and Thai sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the Northern Lights, the pure
Northern Lights, which is primarily in
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 65 to 70 percent Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other is sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: The story of the Northern Lights goes back
to the early 70s when hippies from
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan brought the seeds to the
Pacific Northwest and hybridized them with
[SPEAKER_04]: the sativas of the day, which back then
were Colombian, probably Mexican,
[SPEAKER_04]: Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say those exact three,
like either Thai, Cambodian, Mexican or
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the sativas of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the ones that were bred into
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically what the Hayes brothers
were selling back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I acquired it in the 80s and I've
pretty much preserved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the 80s, the pure Northern Lights.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have the mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mother I currently have is about 15
years old, but it goes directly back to
[SPEAKER_04]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole lot is a blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like I said, I took the bottom buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took the sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took all the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got rid of most of the stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready for bubble meth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I still can't believe you got over
your Northern Lights from the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, it's humble, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Companies like Sensei Seed and Holland are
kind of washed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had different breeders in and out
of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important what you decide to
cross it with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which male you choose is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it just becomes a business and people
are just working for money, it's less
[SPEAKER_04]: passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So less selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: As profits go up, integrity goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but this is the fine delicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the balancing act of every
successful company that balances those two
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you recognize that it's there,
then you can pay attention to not allowing
it to go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, having quality with integrity and
making money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's doable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it's generally like I use my
passion to fuel, to create something
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I create something awesome,
then people have no problem paying for
[SPEAKER_05]: that awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we should throw a little bit of
bud down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I must say, a lot of the times I barter
for things that I need and other people
[SPEAKER_04]: know how to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And alter barter bud or seeds or clones or
whatever it may be for their expertise in
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need a drywaller?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not presently, but you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take a little bit of
this, which is really we don't need to
[SPEAKER_05]: take too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's windy too right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The camera's in the open door and it's
kind of one of those like real nice windy
[SPEAKER_05]: summer days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to be careful as to not.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things when you're producing
really clean resin is to be mindful of
[SPEAKER_05]: where the plant matter ends up because
just getting some on the edge or the rim
[SPEAKER_05]: of your frame can later be brushed by your
arm onto the table and right into your
[SPEAKER_05]: pure glance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, this is a kind of a real gentle
process, you know, probably the gentler,
[SPEAKER_05]: the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably literally throw it down
and pick it up and you can see all that
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminant that got caught there on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's not to say that all of that is
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of that is heads, but the good stuff
will be right on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be diamonds, pure heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kind of see it in the blue of
where it says go Canucks, but what I've
[SPEAKER_05]: got is a, I've got a little brush we'll
use to brush it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually why don't we just collect
that, call it the pure of the pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very small amount, but it also came
instantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to photograph it to see,
I can see some contaminant in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's throw this back over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of move some of this into the
corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drop a few more piles.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much learning with each batch and
each material, you know, there's certain
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why you want to do what I did the first
time which was be uber, uber gentle and
[SPEAKER_05]: just see what you got.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to see sometimes a certain strain
might rain resin like nothing you've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: seen and the gentler, the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what that gives us here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Substantially more this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just got a little white piece of
sheer paper that collects it quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a good dab right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you ready for a dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just got done macro photographing the
first little bounce, which we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say two hefty size dabs there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The purity looked real good.
[SPEAKER_05]: 90% gland heads, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's got a nice sticky feel to
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't do the second trick yet,
but I'll show we're going to have a quick
[SPEAKER_05]: dab of this each.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here I'll actually load you up first.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go lad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's melting up nicely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a unique profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give her a little go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing like testing some strains or the
quality of what you've grown by hitting
[SPEAKER_05]: full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: No flavors lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only gained in the purifying of the
gland head ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some nice flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very fruity and full in the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally heady.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heady on a multiple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's still plenty left.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that little trick, I'm going to
put the macro camera safely down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second part of the trick is that we
lift the first screen and with the
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminant that's sitting on the top,
we simply flick the screen about six
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in each corner and once on the,
on the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do it as many or as little times
as you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually did the big one off camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why there's a little pile there
now, but you can see that even more was
[SPEAKER_05]: acquired from our little flick there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that looks like some pretty
decent quality right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did photograph this one here,
which is probably the same quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check up later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just another, I'd say this is
more like 60% heads, but still very pure
[SPEAKER_05]: for dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you get a powerful lens or a microscope
and you get under dry sift, into dry
[SPEAKER_05]: sifting, you realize how hard it is to
make it really pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this, this is a fairly pure product
made fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pass that trick on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw that back on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess what we're going to do is I'm
going to potentially dry sift the rest,
[SPEAKER_05]: not over these smaller screens,
but I'll probably use my larger screens
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll film that later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think right now what we're going to
do is we're going to get ready to run a
[SPEAKER_05]: batch of this dry material through the
bags and we'll get on that here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess in the next couple of minutes
you're ready to rock it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all right guys, welcome back to
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doc and I are outside in the, uh,
I would say it's pretty warm weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised you still got the wild
fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the wild fiber just kind of keeps
you cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, keeps you cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got the original eight bag kit here,
the same ones that I've been running my,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, my own personal out of lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess what we'll do first is we'll
line our bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the water chilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good tip for those of you that
don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, chill your water.
[SPEAKER_05]: My water is sitting over here in a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hear the ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of beautiful ice in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keeping it nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, the colder the better for this
process, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Colder the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're using the old Tibetans,
Tibetan flag colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I hang my bubble bags, it reminds me
of the Tibetan flags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so tell us, uh, well it's something
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a worthy thing to remember the
Tibetan flags.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the heritage of Tibetans.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of gummy bubbles stuck on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we using all the bags today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just put that aside for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit just got stuck on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always like to use all the bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say it's very rare that I won't
use them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it just seemed to make the most sense
to use them all and figure out what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're, uh, what you're dealing with each
time rather than assume that you know
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on better than the bags and
then just leave certain ones out,
[SPEAKER_05]: which people do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just fine if they're happy with
their final product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not one to complain if you're,
if your bubble is melty and liquidy and
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone loves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing things right for however you
need to be doing them, but still have to
[SPEAKER_05]: teach a certain way when you have your own
kind of way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got our 25, 45, 73 and 90 in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up is the 120.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's another coyote.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got coyotes running around my house
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I actually had, uh, my dog got
picked up by the coyote the other day in
[SPEAKER_05]: its mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to the nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, this one is one 60.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black one is the 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine 73 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the orange one is 120.
[SPEAKER_05]: Red and green are our sort of last two
filter bags that keep everything clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we are using material that did get a
bit powdered up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not full nugget.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nugget, but dried.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's some powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll, we'll make sure we double up on
our two 20, which is the main filter bag
[SPEAKER_05]: that the, uh, that the all screen bag is
made out of as well as what this blue bag
[SPEAKER_05]: here is made out of the screen and the one
inside the bubble now are the same size.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll double up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get our bags ready for filtering.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got our pizza boxes lined with
parchment paper sitting indoor,
[SPEAKER_05]: all marked with micron numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I'm going to grab the bubble now
and get it up on the table here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a quick load and we'll get right
back to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doc Atomic is back in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got my good friend Tim in the house as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who just, uh, won first prize,
first place yourself, right on proper
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent and solvent list in the house
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dr. Atomic has decided that he's going
to show us his technique of cloning today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't able to get around to the hash
making that we were going to do last time
[SPEAKER_05]: around, but this time we were going to do
a little bit of cloning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim actually just got himself a couple of
cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got happen in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the, uh, Congo East coast,
sour diesel and the Island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and Doc is now, I'm about to take
cuttings here from the Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got an Olfa blade.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a 25% sharper for a better cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to go just below, uh,
two nodes here to get the wood,
[SPEAKER_04]: get off, get those off into the gel dip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are called rapid rooting plugs
by general hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had tremendous success with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice woody clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the wittiest clone you can for
the fastest rooting, the soft.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you want to do is give it no
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: For at least a week, 10 days before
cloning.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the best thing, if you could flush it
with plain water a few times, if you,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're anticipating to take
strengthens up that bark a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stiffens it up and makes it quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a great tip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting tips from Doc Atomic here on
bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we'll go for another one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you like to get two nodes,
at least it on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, at least one, at least one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then the bottom one, you're cutting
right off and that's where you're opening
[SPEAKER_05]: up on the sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so you don't have to do your slice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you just get more places for the
roots.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great to be a share in the Congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a killer plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorites, but as we've
been discussing, people think they own the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's a good thing that they don't
because some people that don't think they
[SPEAKER_05]: own the world shared this with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with, with the obvious
understanding that I'm sharing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not not going to share it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I, I implore all of you out there
who are watching to share what you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might think that it's the value is
that only you have it, but there is no
[SPEAKER_05]: value in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I assure you, you'll lose the true value
of having something special and not being
[SPEAKER_05]: able to share it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my friends, something will come
back to you when you do things selflessly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when you have attachment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what drags you down.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little this big guy right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're literally going the woodier,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The woodier, the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the size of his clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as they say in Newfoundland,
proper ting by, proper ting by,
[SPEAKER_03]: proper ting there by and it could be on
there down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you soak the rabbit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just soaked these in plain water,
but I've also soaked them with super
[SPEAKER_03]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That rise of tonic is a great one to soak
them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was saying to Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually soak mine in super thrive and it
grows on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's what, what I'll, what I'll do
is I'll water them now with a weak super
[SPEAKER_03]: rise of tonic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a little cut there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nipped you with the blade.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dangerous work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so sharp.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25% sharper than he said right at the
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost cut my finger off with one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, they cut through carpet,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut through everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you done with Congo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Done with Congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is next up from the dock?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's such a healthy weapon for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet skunk is that one right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the one?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to compare the fennel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a fennel of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to check out your fennel of sweet
skunk in Congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I suspect they'd potentially be the
same, but you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones are lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a little harder to get woody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a nice woody one right here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you saying the Congo is a little
harder to root in general?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think not so if you take these bigger
woody or cuts, but if you take the real
[SPEAKER_05]: small cuts, that it definitely has the
potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be an amazing clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet skunk for the win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, it's such a beautiful day out right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The birds are chirping, the clones are
getting cut and the genetics are getting
[SPEAKER_05]: shared.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really what a better, what a better way
to spend the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and some of these, I'll work
into my line and we'll see how they go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And perhaps you out there can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be able to buy some like
Northern Lights Congo or some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds some Northern Congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to be scientific now and label.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always best to label before rather
than after.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, you know, do it while you're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't wait till after you've done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can definitely, uh, find yourself in a
situation where you're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that was, you lose
credibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what's the point?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for us to know the names of
the strings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the idea of even keeping
like the little tags with the little right
[SPEAKER_05]: around the bottom of the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like each individual plant that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I folded the, uh, tape over and
onto a toothpick and just kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're back guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just continuing to hear with the,
uh, sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I have this, but you never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a different funnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to write out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly, it's certainly not one
that's around so often that you would pass
[SPEAKER_05]: it up when it came by your plate,
whether you had it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when I heard that he had it,
I had both the sweet skunk in the Congo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also thought should probably make sure
that there, I have yet to bloom out either
[SPEAKER_05]: of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, this sweet skunk, I know for 150%
fact, it is exactly the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I've, I've cleaned the resin from
it, from, uh, from the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some sweet skunks.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing's hella woody, but it's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not be tall enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you cut it right at the bottom,
maybe, and then you can cut it at the nose
[SPEAKER_05]: woody enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been doing this a while,
haven't you?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's surely a nice day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you can see the clones here that
we've taken already have drooped over.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because of the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally we wouldn't do it in the,
in the wide open sun like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing it like this because it's a
nice atmosphere and we want to share and
[SPEAKER_05]: do an educational video for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But ideally if you can do this in your,
you know, in your controlled environment,
[SPEAKER_05]: you take the clones, you cut them,
they go right into the dome and,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, with the mist that it keeps them from,
from sagging over.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a high humidity environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally I would put them under
fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd use a warm and a cool for a full
spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Astor boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's real nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a different sweet skunk?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's the exact same one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's a clone from that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this East coast sourdise?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that, but here, grab it from
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a nice woody clone,
this is the mum.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the clone that came off of
this plant right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this actually came, uh,
via a row as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite a nice little, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took one, a nice woody.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were, these are really trippy in the
sense that they're super stretched out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're different from, you can tell the
sweets guns, which have so many nodes,
[SPEAKER_05]: three, four nodes, just in a short clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones are very stretched out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a special strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Tiva heritage, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make it stretch like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's definitely, the leaves wouldn't
give it away like that, but the stretch
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Congo sweet skunk, East coast sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to share genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we'll have to have a bowl or two after
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell some good stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've always got some great stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think up a few to tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think up a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like this, uh, this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very different from all my other
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of my plants look like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get, because they're sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it's, uh, how have you found
this rooting wise?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it rooted really strong.
Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've only cut it a few times,
like maybe four or five root cuts since
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had it, but it, it, it cut real nice
and fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rooted good within a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a nice, uh, healthy roots that
were, that were ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the one plant that I've grown
of it, which is, you know, I only took
[SPEAKER_05]: this not very long ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you, have you seen these before?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I have not seen those before.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look good though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've apparently injected some,
something secreting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, uh, but it's tree bark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very foamy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the ideal ratio of oxygen and
water, which is, and it's still sturdy
[SPEAKER_05]: when you, when you put the clone in,
it's not all loose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like sometimes the peat pucks are.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get into that middle hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to put it in until it's just
snug.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to squish it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that's already been taken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just cut it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean you're not going to have
one, two, three, four beautiful sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very woody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the main, main, the main one that
the plant was.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should look at maybe some Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you look at some Bob?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the barb?
[SPEAKER_05]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have an interest in barb?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the Shishkeberry cross with the
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you rather go straight Afghani?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, bubble man in your wisdom,
in my wisdom, what is your opinion of the
[SPEAKER_04]: barb?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I love the barb.
[SPEAKER_05]: The barb produces resin kind of unlike any
other strain I've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just produces resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a resin producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right there actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how would you put it on the Indica
sativa side?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's definitely got that,
it's not what I would call an
[SPEAKER_05]: overwhelmingly wicked strong smoke,
but it's just super enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The terpene profile is loud, meaning it's
very, very strong smelling and it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: an all around great producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would maybe grab Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those two.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got Congo, Sweet Skunk, Sour Diesel,
Barbara Bud and Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we connoisseurs or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm messing around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great because I was about to cut
these all down and it's so nice to see
[SPEAKER_05]: them go somewhere where they'll survive
rather than get thrown into my compost
[SPEAKER_05]: pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to really do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I usually cut them down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't let them get too big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now they're a good size,
but like for instance, this one was
[SPEAKER_05]: probably going to get cut down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to get them too tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to kill them.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not kill them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cut them back, cut them back,
cut them back and cut them back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so each time I cut them back,
I throw dozens of these away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barbara, you're a sweet lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, she's like a newscaster or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barbara Bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Named after a famous, her real name is
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca is down in Jamaica now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes down there all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got lots of customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, even you run out of my stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she showed me pictures on the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going in a couple of weeks in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really gratifying when people send me
pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of your strains going all over the place?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is gratifying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't have strains, so I
wouldn't know in that sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know and we know that cannabis
changes our life for the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a nice clone you just took right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like primo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pistol it hairs, skoken out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost ready for a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the D-nail on lockdown just off
camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to go and sit down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, you've still got three more after
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do Astro Boy as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that dome on now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better to get them all than to not get
them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the dome nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dome.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the dome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I really have my eye on Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in case the one you don't have isn't
the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, we're not going to discuss
it on camera, but we already discussed
[SPEAKER_04]: these.
[SPEAKER_05]: The politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's genetic politics in every group.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you guys know that certain people
always feel whether rightfully so or
[SPEAKER_05]: wrongfully so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, I don't think that really
matters.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you never own any strain really.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come into the world with nothing and we
leave with nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in between we can hoard or share.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear is fear, love.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy with the way these were
shared with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see as the audience who's
watching, you watched Matt give me these
[SPEAKER_05]: strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not this particular one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got this one from my buddy Ron when I
went to the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll have to continue this when I
come over again and I take these nice top
[SPEAKER_05]: ones because they're going to get thrown
away otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I come over with some of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this one was bred by Ro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the background?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Apollo 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smacking a male of Apollo 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smacking an Ortega.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ortega crossed with a C99.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's special.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want me to take these two?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would bring it right down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of these would take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be the first ones to get
snipped if you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to see another light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: You saved them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saved them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be impressed with this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the SPCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super fruity, smelly, and it's really
nice growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll just be impressed with everything
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a plant that hasn't even been
topped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at how many things are coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great looking clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble man's world, chilling with Dr.
Atomic, taking clones, sharing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get the dome on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do it inside, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually even inside, you'd get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be in a way that it's just all the
air, the sun, the heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give them a little bit of a... There
we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your ribbon gel closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little domage happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like magic that I just had that
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, in the dome and they're going
inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on doc.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some good stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go get some bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna go do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab it up.
Dab it up.
Dab it up.
