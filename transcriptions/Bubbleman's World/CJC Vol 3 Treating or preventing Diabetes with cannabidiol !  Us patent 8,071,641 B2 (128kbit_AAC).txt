[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, welcome to the Cannabis
Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you guys a little breakdown,
Cannabis Journal Club is where we review
[SPEAKER_01]: and interpret United States cannabis
patents and scientific journals with
[SPEAKER_01]: concise overviews of complex scientific
literature in an understandable and easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to consume manner to expose the knowledge
hidden in this scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not claim any medical utility and of
these government patents or scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: articles, what we advise you to do is to
obtain your own copies of these public
[SPEAKER_01]: documents and we will often have them
linked in the description of each show
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're watching so we'll make it very
easy for you to access that and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: can share them with your doctors as well
and that's kind of what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to welcome Dr. Allen to the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to drop some gems on us and the
floor is yours, Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm Dr. David Allen and my co-host
here is Marcus Gary Richardson aka Bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: Man also known as Bubble Man and this is
Budley Green and Budley Green says Herb is
[SPEAKER_00]: superb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to be talking about
another patent so please share with us the
[SPEAKER_01]: number and what this patent is going to be
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right to the point, there's two U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patents for cannabis and diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both labeled the same name,
treating or preventing diabetes with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first patent number is 8,071,641.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second patent is named the same,
treating or preventing diabetes with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol and it's patent number U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007-00-999-87A1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came out in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one came out in 2011 and I don't
know why they're both named the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because basically we're
reviewing two lab animal experiments and a
[SPEAKER_00]: human study with this chapter of Cannabis
Journal Club and so both of these patents
[SPEAKER_00]: are authored by Professor Dr. Raphael
Mishulam and are out of the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerusalem and it's interesting that they
would have two patents on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: treating diabetes and they use the word
preventing which they kind of prove but it
[SPEAKER_00]: also kind of alludes to a cure to diabetes
and so you'll have to read this yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up to that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they mentioned that in these patents
that diabetes is the most prevalent
[SPEAKER_00]: endocrine disease worldwide and the
mortality morbidity associated with this
[SPEAKER_00]: is unbelievable because a lot of people go
blind, a lot of people have amputations,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people have to go on renal
dialysis because of diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive cost to the health system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost is unbelievable and so if we
could give you something that would help
[SPEAKER_00]: your diabetes or help you, help prevent
you to develop diabetes, then we've helped
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the complications to diabetes include a
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blindness, heart attack, strokes,
kidney failure, amputations and these
[SPEAKER_00]: people have to go on dialysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have multiple surgical
procedures for venous access so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: put them on dialysis machines and then
there's perineal dialysis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of surgical procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opening them up to susceptibility of
infection too I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two experiments they did was the
first one was they were trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants of the beta cells of the
pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beta cells are the ones that produce
the insulin and they noticed when they did
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants that the immune system
attacked the transplants and it killed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the beta cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they studied these transplants and
they found out that if they gave the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient's cannabis or CBD that the
transplant cell survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they didn't give CBD then almost 100%
of them would be dead and if they did give
[SPEAKER_00]: them CBD about 87% of the cells survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a remarkable finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second animal study they did was
they used these specially raised mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called MOD mice and this is a
strain of mice that develop diabetes
[SPEAKER_00]: within the first month or so of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're an excellent animal model
for studying diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the mice they found out that it
delayed the development of diabetes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a whole lot of evidence and
these pans are extremely long.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the pans is like 50 pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a strain to go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we read this stuff so you don't
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's saying that 100% of untreated
MOD mice develop diabetes and only 53% of
[SPEAKER_01]: mice treated with CBD develop diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like half the mice didn't develop
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a mouse bred that develops
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could decrease the incidence of
diabetes by 53% in this mouse group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just preliminary stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really have not done this on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a human study called the NHANES.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a Roman numeral 3 behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NHANES 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a human study where they found
that people that were using cannabis had a
[SPEAKER_00]: 66% decrease in the incidence of diabetes
than people that weren't using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a human study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they found that the lowest glucose
levels were found in the group of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the highest prevalence of
marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And non-users had two to four times more
likely to develop diabetes as marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the use of CBD was not associated with
any other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't cause any heart failure or any
other trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's safe to use in large doses and
even given chronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not hard evidence that CBD
stops all diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of a bunch of indications
that it can have a major effect and more
[SPEAKER_00]: human studies will be done in the future,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since CBD is so safe, you can't hurt
yourself by taking CBD according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: science that we know so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you think that you have diabetes
or you're getting to be where your sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: is higher, I would definitely put CBD in
my diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so none of these studies are what
happens when you eat cannabis or eat hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp may actually be a better medicine
than marijuana in a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: disease states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know which state is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually seems that THC and CBD work in
conjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most diseases are helped with a
combination of these two products rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since CBD doesn't get you high and you
can take a boatload of it and not hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, then really the government
should be doing studies on what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence of diabetes when you eat
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or eat hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that will be done in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to give people
evidence that they can show their doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you ask your doctor,
do you know about the two U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patents on cannabis or CBD and diabetes?
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't have any idea that this even
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have more information than
your physician does because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: teach this in medical school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that because I did the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called ignorance is not bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in cannabis digest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called my office called one hundred
and fifty seven medical schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked them if they're teaching this
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only 13 percent of the medical schools
even mentioned this science and nobody has
[SPEAKER_00]: organized courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very likely if you're a
student of cannabis, that you may know
[SPEAKER_00]: more medical science about this than your
physicians and your heart surgeon.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's there's always this
protective component and definitely big
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to, you know, Rafael Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to put my picture up with him
when we originally mentioned him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put my picture up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I am at the ICRS in Leiden,
Holland, meeting, meeting the the man
[SPEAKER_01]: himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you that don't know about
Rafael Mishulam, you can go down that
[SPEAKER_01]: rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even at the end of his study,
in conclusion, they said marijuana use was
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with a decreased prevalence of
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prospective studies on humans and animals
need to be clean to need to be completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do not recommend the use of
marijuana for patients at risk for
[SPEAKER_01]: diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just did this study that showed you
could reduce it by fifty three percent in
[SPEAKER_01]: mice that were bred to get diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God bless them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what Dr. Allen and I are
trying to get past this this confusion and
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine reading this patent and
going through it and at the end coming and
[SPEAKER_01]: saying they don't recommend me doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the patent said that it reduced
the and I don't think people can wrap
[SPEAKER_01]: their heads around of the importance of
these mice that were bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get diabetes are way more susceptible
than the human race population getting
[SPEAKER_01]: diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are less susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like every human being gets diabetes
within a month of being born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to think that that is that that
number of forty seven percent that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get it must have been it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be way higher in mice that
weren't bred to get diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys don't know about Dr.
Meshulam, you should definitely learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he should be put forth for a
sainthood because of his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint Meshulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly was like a saint when I met him,
just the kindest, kindest man.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, he must have been 90 something years
old there when I when I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great breakdown on that patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we'll have a Q&A potentially
towards the end of the week where if you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys and I'm sure listen brain tumors and
you know some of the other stuff we've
[SPEAKER_01]: covered antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This diabetes one is a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: An enormous amount of people suffer from
or no loved ones and close family members
[SPEAKER_01]: who suffer from type one and two diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very interesting information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a doctor to tell me that I
consume cannabis orally every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that for the preventative aspects
that I don't even really know 100 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that if cannabis is a part of
this endo cannabinoid cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling system, it's it's it's got to be
preventative as much as it is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much for having us
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that people can use this
information for their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend putting cannabis in your
diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also recommend that I'm not a doctor,
but I have played one on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that what Marcus?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his name used to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we'll finish it with a Budley
Green quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Budley Green says, Herb is superb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot for watching the Cannabis
Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Dr. Allen for sharing his
knowledge as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you at the end of the week
for the Q&A.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ja over evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: God over evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week.
All right.
