[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome on this Sunday morning at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: to Hash Church 2.0 episode 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of tossed one together last
night really quickly, sent out an email
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of last minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be a bit of a hodgepodge of
people in conversation today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Main inspiration was to get Dr. Mark
Scaldone and Chris Barone in here,
[SPEAKER_04]: have a little chemistry talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be part of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me just get the links sent out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the email link, do the Facebook link,
and we should be good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure that I'm getting the right email
sent out so people actually receive it and
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't go into their junk mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, 268 people in the first one minute of
Hash Church today.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, how are you doing, Etienne?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just making sure I haven't plugged
everything in in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_04]: There.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy smokes, I'm dropping glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know you are, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the master.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen your closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the closet with broken roars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice when you show Sam like a
really expensive pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing out of his mouth is
I'm really good at breaking glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: But no glass owner wants to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've missed you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also tell people you hold it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hit on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have said that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will admit that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, damn, it seems like it's been
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Etienne, you've been you've been busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see things going on with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we had our we definitely celebrated
our 19th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks, everybody, to who made that
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the mayor of Berkeley show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see my pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dressed up in my Scooby Doo outfit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw that because you're going to
meet the mayor being a Scooby Doo outfit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Chris would also agree if you're
going to meet the mayor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be in a Scooby Doo outfit,
don't you think, Chris?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only way to meet your
constituency.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm the mayor.
[SPEAKER_06]: My protege is going to be that Rob Ford
guy from fucking Toronto because nothing
[SPEAKER_06]: more honest than Rob Ford.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to think now if that's the
original one or if that's the brother,
[SPEAKER_04]: I always keep I always mix them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob passed away, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now his brother is like in politics and
got chosen as a position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's he's also a ridiculous version of
his brother of just not your average
[SPEAKER_04]: politician, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, yeah, he did pass away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stephen Simons has confirmed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't keep up with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everyone doing this morning?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got skunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Chris Barone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Etienne Fontaine in the room and
me, bubble man, as well as four hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: and fifty two viewers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good amount of people for nine oh
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we start with everybody,
I have a question for Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like better, pure THC
distillate or pure THC or not pure tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: dry sip that's terpene rich naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can only be what 80, 85 percent THC,
but it's pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would say like right now my go to
are the like THC products with like
[SPEAKER_06]: basically like as little turps as
possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, if like any turps, I like pretty
much just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like lately I've been on kind of like a
hotter, hotter dab, more THC trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, my friends keep me turped
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I say like that's where my go to keeps
me like more stimulated and less stony.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as time has gone by, my love,
I certainly appreciate the turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like physiologically, they're a
little bit more harsher than just the THC
[SPEAKER_06]: products for the higher THC products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it depends on the level because I
know when I spoke dry sip, which are still
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely high in turpeneat, but also
they've got, I mean, the last time I
[SPEAKER_02]: measured it was 83 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a respectful amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest, I guess, is probably a few plant
cells and a few and the wax that's on it
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've had kind of a change as well
here in California because everybody it's
[SPEAKER_05]: a new market again as it's re-emerged in
the legal world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything that's coming out right now
is all sauces.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't to find shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else is near next to impossible
and kind of frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel you exactly there, Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel the I feel the harshness of the
turps so much because my mix I'm used to a
[SPEAKER_05]: little more waxier mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, it seems to be more THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't seem to get as high with my mix
with as much as all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: these turpene sauces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that will change in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just as the market is getting up and
getting itself established still,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just the reality that we've faced.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, honestly, I've yet to actually yet
to be going to a store in California yet
[SPEAKER_06]: to buy anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't I can't tell you personally about
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_06]: But from what I hear, that's pretty much
consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, though, that, you know,
it's true that the turps definitely create
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of a more stony version.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're if you're kind of like
sitting around and watching movies or you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have to do too much, you can really
enjoy those turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you might, you know, potentially be
doing some chemistry or maybe need a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more focus, maybe less turps is
going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that turpene, the right ones are a
few of them that can potentially THC makes
[SPEAKER_02]: it stronger and definitely is like a
steering wheel where it modulates the THC
[SPEAKER_02]: for, you know, other up or down or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Chimera in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that big, large bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's Chimera behind that bud
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's him for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he sounds like he's in a tube,
like a mile away.
[SPEAKER_14]: What up, y'all?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got five hundred and thirty seven
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have invited a few others.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to see Wade Lafter in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if Forrest is going to make
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Mark said he was going to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did invite Indra.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he was probably going to hang out
just in chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if he feels the conversation is on
point, he might come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a really good conversation with with
Indra yesterday, actually hadn't hadn't
[SPEAKER_04]: spoken with him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, I really do quite enjoy one
on one conversations with Indra.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just I that's my favorite Indra,
the one on one conversations I get with
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just we went pretty deep yesterday
and had some good, good retrospective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see what Mark's saying here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking forward to seeing him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimera, are you coming down for the
Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm a judge this year, so I thought
I was going to have to actually leave this
[SPEAKER_05]: morning to go get my judges kit,
but apparently they're not finished yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to deliver them to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to drive all the way up to
Leighton.
Ville.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can barely hear you, Chimera.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're literally so far back in the mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like a one out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard a single word.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your cat's name, Chris?
[SPEAKER_06]: So this cat is Smitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's this kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're a Trumpite and you believe
that this rabbit busses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sam, I do what I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever the appropriate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: I joined it just the exact time to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he'd say more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, coughing dabs, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to hit that mute button.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so funny yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a quick little Google chat with
Chris and Mark and Chris and I are trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark's just like, oh, just ripping hard
dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he was ripping hot dabs,
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who prefers a hot dab over a cool dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard Chris say it earlier today.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no doubt about that hot dab rocks
you in a way that that low temp dab just
[SPEAKER_04]: can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely doesn't have the taste
and you lose a little bit of the nuances.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm telling you, like that overly hot
dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took one not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember where I was, but it ended
up being hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just coughing for about five
plus minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And afterwards, there was legitimately I
was completely destroyed for like the next
[SPEAKER_04]: 15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you consider hot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: What temperature?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hot is hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know where it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was out on the glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at stratosphere glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys know
stratosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he's doing those.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Sam's doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the spinning stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now your mic is as on as on gets my
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, these guys were heating the shit
up with like an acetylene torch or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, you know, like a welding torch,
not like or or maybe it was even their
[SPEAKER_04]: their glass blowing torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember taking the dab and it being
so hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, coil coil condenser was there as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't remember who else was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, I was like for about 15,
20 minutes, I went and sat out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: garden and just was like, holy smokes,
like I am absolutely flying right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's straight to the forehead when you
take a hottie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, toss up between the oxygen
deprivation from coughing so much and then
[SPEAKER_05]: the addition of an exurgeon of hot high
THC into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your brain kind of goes, don't stand up
real fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's it's completely insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was I think that the that the oxygen
thing has a lot to do with it,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I find every time I cough after
about the five minute mark, every single
[SPEAKER_04]: cough, I get like 100 feet higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like this exponential experience
of of a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where we see a lot was at the
[SPEAKER_02]: legends that we used to have in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would see people quite literally
floating out of the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that the cannabis cup is happening
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had one last year, too,
sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I didn't go to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw again, Jando put a picture up that
she was there and I was like, wait,
[SPEAKER_05]: wait, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I got married there back in what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Twenty some odd years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety eight, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety ninety nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was definitely there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever year it was, I was definitely
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaskin did the did the ceremony and the
guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patty Smythe was the on stage and the
wedding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wedding cake, like I said, in a pound and
a half of trichromes that what he called
[SPEAKER_05]: its mom made the cake and it was oh,
my God, destroyed everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Herrera, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all just wasted by this cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the infamous wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a memory from about four or five or
six years ago come up today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's too bad that I can't find it now
because it was it was me and Rob Clark and
[SPEAKER_04]: we were walking to the back apartments of
the Krasnopolski Hotel where I always
[SPEAKER_04]: stayed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never stayed at the front.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked through the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks beautiful, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob and I came across a giant mountain
of ice that the hotel had dumped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a funny picture of Rob and I.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There must have been someone else with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're basically holding up the ice and
making this crazy sort of crazy sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: look.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with my mic?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to turn it down a bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can turn my mic down a bit if that
works.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where would you be without ice?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I see the group comments?
[SPEAKER_06]: All I have is like a group chat with the
members of the group.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a way to see the what anyone else
if anyone else is saying anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to open up a YouTube separate
window and then go to this exact channel
[SPEAKER_05]: to this exact post.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the right, you'll have the check
and you did make sure it's muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Echoes wicked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a little better?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still got a pooch mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I switch devices.
[SPEAKER_07]: I pulled this up on the phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So seem to be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying to Etienne that there's
some absolute fire that's been entered in
[SPEAKER_07]: this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw some of the molecular farms entries
and man, were they ever beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm back to doing a pens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure exactly what I'm judging at
the moment, but I'll find out when I get
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking forward to it and seeing you as
well, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'll be great to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I want to go to the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my worry is that they won't let me
out of America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm less worried about getting in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, American folks are some of my best
friends that are much more dangerous in
[SPEAKER_02]: America than out of America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have my lawyer bring that up if I
ever get detained at the border and kept
[SPEAKER_04]: in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the big thing is they'll get rid of
you as fast as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big thing is social media,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you don't want to be saying that
you're going down for an event that
[SPEAKER_07]: involves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just banned a couple of people,
gave them a lifetime bans for trying to go
[SPEAKER_07]: down to the to the the MJ BizCon in Las
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that guy was just an investor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, they were invested in a
facility in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody knows it before the Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for hookers and gambling.
[SPEAKER_07]: They really don't like it when foreigners
are putting money into a federal illegal
[SPEAKER_07]: space, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing for Americans to be
investing in their own space.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it kind of gives this
flavor of cartels when you're taking
[SPEAKER_07]: foreign money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to mute you, Indra.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came in pretty loud with the background
noise there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, what they're saying for people
to do now, I know as Terry Booth was
[SPEAKER_07]: speaking, the CEO of Aurora was speaking
at this event.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess they and some of these other
folks, they told them just go to L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: and tell them you're going to L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: for something unrelated on business and
then drive over.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to show at the border and
say, go to this cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem is if you punch my name in for
sure, for sure, for sure, bubble man shit
[SPEAKER_04]: comes up like intertwined as hash churches
and Instagrams and all this, I guess,
[SPEAKER_04]: not really easy to get over the border
sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you if you again, if you have one
of those ways of getting your waivers and
[SPEAKER_07]: then you have a purpose that you're going
down for, that's sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I do not have a waiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: The part that I don't like about the
waiver is the part where you have to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: border to get it signed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to go to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: border before you get your waiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only way to get the waiver.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's better than traveling and
being carried away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, you're still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for me, it's always felt like I'm
entering a federal penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what going across the border into
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and for that matter, for that matter,
it's the same as coming up into Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just can't deny me in my own country.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they turn you away, just get a four
wheel drive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dude, hey, here's a picture I found
from back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's me.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is old Ed and there's Hillary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is Andrew D'Angelo from
Harborside and Todd.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is back in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went and saw some show during the while
we were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, that's from back in ninety
five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Hillary working at the Positronix?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, she only worked there that one
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was ninety five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was ninety five for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because she started the club.
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved to B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: the next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I stayed with her at her place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a booth that year on the top floor
of the Pax party house smack dab between
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Herrera and his daughter and Eagle
Bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how that's how I got introduced to
the cannabis cup, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two egos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just smacked in between Jeepers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was it was it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, Jack, we didn't know who
Eagle was, but we had studied the book of
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me tell you, I mean, I knew that book
like the back of my hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to use it in the next year
to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we had used it that year,
the year prior.
[SPEAKER_04]: Previously, ninety four.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used it to convince our ministers to
let us grow hemp in the province.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nine months later, in ninety five,
we grew our first hemp field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty that's pretty fucking
crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So smack dab to be able to be beside the
guy who literally turns you on to being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to acknowledge all of the information
and articulate it back to a minister of
[SPEAKER_04]: finance and a minister of agriculture to
be able to convince them to grow something
[SPEAKER_04]: that had not been grown in over 73 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more I look back at that, the more I
think that was that was some incredible
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what would have happened if
Jack hadn't have come to my to West
[SPEAKER_05]: Virginia University in 1989.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I hadn't gotten a copy of the Emperor
was no close.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what would have happened to
my life, but I'm beyond thankful it has.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did because it's changed my entire
reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you got yours before me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our first one in either 90 or 91 is
when I got turned on to that book and just
[SPEAKER_04]: like annihilated it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I had a girlfriend break up with me
because I would go to a party and all I
[SPEAKER_05]: would talk about was the Emperor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then all these pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you just shut up about all this pot
and hemp stuff and you take this book with
[SPEAKER_05]: you to parties and you show people like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just annoyed the shadowy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, OK, look, it's just not
getting getting getting along here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I chose the Emperor wears no
clothes over, you know, my girlfriend at
[SPEAKER_05]: the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But dude, I'm telling you, it changed my
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the first of a long list of
women that went by the wayside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: we didn't even go to parties.
[SPEAKER_04]: We literally just straight hung out at our
little hemp exchange hemp store and people
[SPEAKER_04]: came to us and we puffed and chuffed and
just talked nonstop about this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought one of the 100 percent pure hemp
ones the year that he did them at the cup
[SPEAKER_04]: there for 100 US that was probably 96 or
97.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how much stuff has changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an ex-girlfriend that I ran into on
social media over the past couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this chick, when we broke up,
she she threatened to call the RCMP on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyway, this week she was throwing up
the cannabis community hashtag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just made me think like, oh,
damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, things have changed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's your trip on it, Ryan,
because I know a lot of people and I sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of see the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the hypocrisy on seeing people from
law enforcement and people in positions of
[SPEAKER_04]: power that fought this plant for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of I can see that one side of
the fence where I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They shouldn't be allowed to play.
[SPEAKER_04]: They shouldn't be allowed to be involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they most certainly shouldn't be
allowed to fucking hold some monopoly over
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that fought for it for all
these years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then another part of me is kind of
like we got them like they're in like the
[SPEAKER_04]: very people that were the destroyers for
so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, like, I mean, really, when I think
about who I was preaching to the most over
[SPEAKER_04]: all these years, it was them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, stop doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, just change the laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, don't keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now now they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even more so doing it like jumping
both feet in, like, I want to be involved
[SPEAKER_04]: in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of me is like, huh, we flip the
script.
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't like, you know, the cops
don't make the laws.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, by and large, I mean, like,
you know, the nature of a people in a
[SPEAKER_06]: power, you know, they're there to,
like, do what they think is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're following, like, their cue.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, obviously, there's cops on the
beat that have to make like the
[SPEAKER_06]: discretionary call.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's kind of unfair to be
like, fuck all cops.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, at the same time,
it's kind of like, fuck those cops that
[SPEAKER_06]: were the dickheads at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now what's to say that there's not
like reasonable police and folks that are
[SPEAKER_06]: like getting involved?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how many of us on justice panel
alone have dealt with the cops at the at
[SPEAKER_06]: your inspection, and they got the gun and
it's the same cop that would have thrown
[SPEAKER_06]: you heads the same power.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just following a different rule book.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you kind of got to give them
the benefit of the doubt, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: because now there's just that much less
shit for cops to hassle us about,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the real problem is becoming
a favorite of every dickhead cop,
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming a marijuana grower, marijuana
wholesaler, marijuana retailer,
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana whatever, because it's better
for them to do that than be a dickhead
[SPEAKER_02]: cop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, Sam with the harsh realities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the way I see it is if it's legal,
then everybody has to be able to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, have the right to be involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's certainly distasteful that some
of these people like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: Julianne Fantino, for example,
or, you know, Brian Mulroney, former prime
[SPEAKER_07]: minister of Canada is involved with
acreage holdings in the states that which
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to be a big play coming out of
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the house is in that shenanigans
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sucks to see, but at the same time,
I feel the same way as Sam, all these
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibitionists deserve to, you know,
they've changed their realities,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're going to change the reality
further for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, as stated before,
we didn't lose everything at once.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to gain it back all at
once.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and it's not all, I mean,
the sad thing is it's not all ours to
[SPEAKER_07]: take, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when it's an open market,
it's an open market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, a lot of these people have
long term established lives and
[SPEAKER_07]: connections and money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what helps you get business
done in the real world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, you know, as a community,
we definitely point these people out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, hopefully people with ethics
will vote with their dollars and vote to
[SPEAKER_07]: support the people that are OGs and have
been doing it for 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, whatever, what are you
really going to do, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when it's legal, everybody has the
right to be involved, and then you just
[SPEAKER_07]: have to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, what's going to happen is
if you can produce it better, cheaper,
[SPEAKER_02]: higher quality, more organic, more
whatever that the customer wants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to sell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're seeing, you know,
in the Canadian marketplace, at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got all these corporate guys that are
producing, you know, hundreds,
[SPEAKER_07]: millions of square feet of acres of
absolute bunk, like the flowers are
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking garbage, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that they've started letting these
micro cultivators in, people will get in,
[SPEAKER_07]: they'll start small.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they'll work their way
through the chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: The truth of the matter is, you know,
the person with the best flowers has
[SPEAKER_07]: always won the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just not going to change,
right?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the consumer wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would add one more thing to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That the ratio that once was, say in the
90s, when I would see an enormous amount
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis every week, and there was only
a very small percentage of it that was
[SPEAKER_04]: exceptional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still to this day, it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just going to line up in the
sense that you said there's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: all these guys growing bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't get me wrong, the world loves
bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the world is just super happy with
bunk food and bunk beer and bunk
[SPEAKER_04]: everything in their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, they're going to smoke bunk
herb along with their bunk cigarettes and
[SPEAKER_04]: drink their bunk booze.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's another percentage of
people, that little niche that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the IPA breweries sort of came
into existence for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis craft growing, whether it's
an LP or whether it's a small time grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion, it's the quality that
matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care the conditions that comes out
of it, that it comes from, just as long as
[SPEAKER_04]: the quality is super on point.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it was grown properly,
genetics that were properly bred were used
[SPEAKER_04]: so that, you know, the plant's going to be
something special and not just the same
[SPEAKER_04]: old, same old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for years in BC, it was kush,
kush, kush, kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great if you were, you know,
Johnny B and loved kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't get me wrong, I don't mind kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some right over my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like other cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a long time, BC was hurting,
just pumping out the kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right now, we're seeing,
you know, the craft market has not gone
[SPEAKER_05]: away in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still see small craft product and it's
still commands its price.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market, of course, is not to the
standards that we set at BPG, because for
[SPEAKER_05]: 18 plus years, we bought at certain ratios
and priced at ratios that we thought were
[SPEAKER_05]: fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was responded by everybody in the
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why people continue to come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have good pot for good price,
end of story, they're going somewhere else
[SPEAKER_05]: and they can go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, through the distributor
reality that we see in California,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not to the standards that we set.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in Nevada, when I recently visited
there, it has and was.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in time, it will get better.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, the craft market is
still here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just had to professionalize itself
and not everybody could make the leap or
[SPEAKER_05]: could afford to make the leap or wanted to
make the leap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was just down there and I was
actually quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Cali rags have, you know,
there's all these contamination issues
[SPEAKER_07]: that have always been in the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that they have this regulated
system, they've actually really honed down
[SPEAKER_07]: the amount of weed that is available in
the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like one of the suppliers was telling me,
you know, they have a vape pen company and
[SPEAKER_07]: they were saying, try to buy 100 liters of
clean distillate that actually makes the
[SPEAKER_07]: grade, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually will pass the regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just not available in the
marketplace to the point that growers are
[SPEAKER_07]: getting the 3000 plus bucks a pound again,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: For the stuff that truly is fire and meets
the grade, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it passes the regulation,
which is well, that's we're only up to
[SPEAKER_05]: series two.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting ready for phase three,
which is happening January 1st,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is as more microbial testing and
more pesticide testing, which I'm afraid
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to see a bubble hash go the
way for a while because it fails the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbial tests just off of Berkeley
Municipalities water, which is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all of the East Bay's water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it shows also we need different
standards for different products.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have it finally refined at the
science level, just for something like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just filter that water out?
[SPEAKER_05]: I should money cost buying filter being
lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should also be using like a stainless
steel sort of GMP compliant unit as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have two people currently.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that Chris?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said people out here wouldn't even be
able to spell GMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have clean drinking water in
the city of Flint, Michigan, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You drink Flint water in Flint,
Michigan and you die.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's bigger infrastructure issues
about water in this country other than
[SPEAKER_10]: making water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're in hash church, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to start the water processing
cleanliness chat room on your channel,
[SPEAKER_04]: by all means, dude, I'll come in and talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And forget about Flint, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just being American.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been countries in the world that
have haven't had clean water for a very
[SPEAKER_04]: long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, remember is that hamper mediates,
you know, like if you grow ham next to a
[SPEAKER_10]: heavy metals, you know, processing plant,
you're probably going to have heavy metals
[SPEAKER_10]: in your hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it definitely does with
radioactive nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certain plants that are
phytoremediative that pull up heavy metals
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure cannabis would pull up the
majority.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're called bioaccumulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a whole bunch of studies on that
and they found that like certain ions will
[SPEAKER_07]: be pulled up into the roots, but not into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that there's a whole bunch of
that we still have yet to learn about that
[SPEAKER_07]: whole process.
[SPEAKER_07]: It absorbs it out of the soil and then it
gets stuck in the plant, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_07]: the roots, the fibers or, you know,
does it go up into the flowers?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really know that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was discovered by Joe Strobel and
Jeff Keim in Ontario in 19, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe 1995.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grew their first field in 94 and Joe
was a tobacco farmer and they sprayed
[SPEAKER_04]: Radium-226 on the field, which is a
radioactive nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess they have to measure the
fields before, during and after all these
[SPEAKER_04]: different sort of times they have to
measure the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they found the numbers to be like too
low after the hemp was cut down and they
[SPEAKER_04]: tested the hemp and found out that it had
pulled a bunch of this Radium-226 out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil and had stored it in,
I guess, in the cellulose and fibers of
[SPEAKER_04]: the stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: LeoFox97, I had an actual study that broke
it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually grew hemp on a Polish heavy
metals factory and it just was,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to look back on it now and see if
it was in the roots or in the stock or in
[SPEAKER_05]: the flower because that's a good point,
Chimera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, there's just, I mean,
I think there's probably a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: lessons that we still have to learn about
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet there's, you know, cannabis is one
of these remarkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did we lose him?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: My poster keeps doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OCD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should just get a new piece of tape.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually, what's that Mark?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right at cannabis was remarkable for
doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just left us hanging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure he'll be back in to talk here in
a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got back from Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there at the Canadian Hemp Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp Trade Alliance conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remarkable.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was saying is that cannabis is this
remarkable, you know, plasticity and
[SPEAKER_07]: traits, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: On every single character that you look at
the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a leaf shape, stem,
width, height, yield, seed yield,
[SPEAKER_07]: seed size, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a variation, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I bet that we'll probably end up seeing
that some varieties are able to
[SPEAKER_07]: bio-accumulate faster and are more
tolerant than other varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just don't know any of that information
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I saw more stuff like this at the
hemp conference in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of sort of talking,
but it was all this sort of delusional CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: talk where they thought they were going
to, you know, set up an entire industry
[SPEAKER_04]: extracting the 1% of CBD that's in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also hearing of problems in states
where it's legal slash medical and hemp is
[SPEAKER_05]: growing as cross-pollination is happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people's crops are getting seeded and
people are getting angry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're financially ruined by
something like that, it's going to bring
[SPEAKER_05]: out a whole bunch of ethics issues
regarding the reality of what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing and the reality of what it's going
to take to actually be, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a high grade cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of no different than
having an avocado farmer as a neighbor in
[SPEAKER_04]: California that's doing the plane or the
helicopter avid drop every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like right next door to him and
it's like, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't control that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's going all the way over to your
crop and your crops just absorbing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is again, again, it's the
evolution of an industry, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when you start, when you turn the
switch on an industry, everything doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: run right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to develop new technologies and
there's all these portions of the value
[SPEAKER_07]: chain, like seeds, like high CBD seeds
with that are less than 0.3% THC that are
[SPEAKER_07]: actually registered varieties,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can't in Canada, you can't just
take, if you have a clone that's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, say you have a magical clone
that's 28% CBD acid and it produces less
[SPEAKER_07]: than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't plant that variety underneath.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gotta be in the registry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be a registered variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I met the guy who runs that the seed
registry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, I mean, it's, it's a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they meet once a year to decide on
what the new varieties are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you know what the regulations are?
[SPEAKER_04]: For that they want you to R and D the
strip, the cultivar for three seasons,
[SPEAKER_04]: three, three years, and, and bring them
the data that shows the THC and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, all the sort of things that
they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically it's, it takes three years
to get a cultivar registered into the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: registry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you don't, yeah, I think that's,
that's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were to start from zero in Canada,
but you can use data from other countries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they want three years worth of data
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think if you have years of trials,
for example, varieties in the States,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is you might be able to shave a year
off, but I'd be surprised if you got it in
[SPEAKER_04]: and under a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish it was something different.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I've got this variety that's,
you know, it's, it's, again, it's a low
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid producing plant, but it
produces like two to three CBG acid by
[SPEAKER_07]: weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, that's totally the point.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in, in, in order to plant it,
you need to do it under a research
[SPEAKER_07]: license, which is, you know, a pain in the
ass because you need special exemptions to
[SPEAKER_07]: be able to harvest and use the molecules.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it's, it's just pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a variety registered,
like a hemp variety or any other kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: value in the EU, you can then,
which is paperwork in one year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want trials in Canada always though,
just to show that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they, you know, they're definitely
scared of these plants somehow magically
[SPEAKER_07]: producing 800% THC in the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the environment.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they always want some data,
it's, it's a bit ridiculous, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it does, you know, like the ones
that we're talking about, Sam or,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, are related to registered
varieties in, uh, in Europe, but,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, man has never a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sure is.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and in the meantime,
there's no CBG acid, there's no CBG,
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabigerral in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, could be using this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the varieties that can grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, this paperwork is keeping it
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, my state can't tell the difference
between, you know, hemp TH, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD and, you know, Indica CBD pardon me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cause there is no different CBD
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that chemically doctor, but the state
of California says no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have a bottle of CBG right here
and a number of them, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're not that hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would submit that you're,
that's an erroneous statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not for Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, we're, we're limited there,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's regular, there's just federal
regulations that are dictating all these
[SPEAKER_07]: problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the availability of the,
of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's it good for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabigerral has a whole bunch of uses.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're finding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've just showed that it's a CB one
receptor agonist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's, they've found that it has,
uh, activity against like the superbugs,
[SPEAKER_10]: like MRSA does not get you high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for, you know, grounding purposes,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not in agony.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I would, I would say,
what's it good for?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say for producing the entire
cannabinoid and terpene profile makes a
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty good building block.
[SPEAKER_04]: Skin lesions.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been carrying it with somebody who's
had a couple of
[SPEAKER_13]: suspicious about, and she started applying
this and a week later they dried up and
[SPEAKER_13]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's not a, I mean, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a trial, but what they've
done, you know, they definitely have
[SPEAKER_07]: showed that it was, like I said,
it's, it's, uh, it, it helps, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: suppress things like methicine resistant
strepococcus, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, which is MRSA, which is one of the
superbugs, um, but they have a hard time
[SPEAKER_07]: treating with antibiotics and it's able to
suppress that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it's got these anti-inflammatory
properties and you know, I think we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to find that it's like CBD,
you know, like we will find for all of
[SPEAKER_07]: these cannabinoids, um, like we did for
CBD, there's not just one thing is good
[SPEAKER_07]: for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Helps a whole bunch of stuff, but really
you can't test that or you can't put that
[SPEAKER_07]: into the market to start having people do
these, you know, whether it's not really a
[SPEAKER_07]: clinical trial, but it's like collecting
community data until the molecule is out
[SPEAKER_07]: in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the issue that Mark and I run
into with the hydrogenated cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can make them, but like who the hell
can you really make them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you really make them somewhere?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where can you distribute them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to distribute them?
[SPEAKER_06]: You run into that sort of interesting
thing where like the science and people's
[SPEAKER_06]: interest is far quicker and far more
advanced than the regulatory framework and
[SPEAKER_06]: handle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, how do you, I mean,
you make these products or how do you even
[SPEAKER_06]: like, test for total cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what do you have to, you have to
like, uh, report CBG in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember on the regs, but you
know, you're going to get like a 0% active
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids, but then there's still a
value in the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now someone has to know about it to
like, Oh, and access it with all of them,
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially with all the available
cannabinoids out here in big quantity over
[SPEAKER_06]: the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on with your cell with your,
your petri dish studies on all that kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you had some of that being sent
over to, uh, to Aberdeen to what's his
[SPEAKER_07]: name?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Pertwee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever get that study?
[SPEAKER_07]: Those studies go in and get your receptor
binding studies and everything done.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what, I don't know what
Mark's status is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark's got the relationship with the guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just making this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us an update Mark on the H007.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hexahydra.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're muted big boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, let me go look in the, uh,
am I unmuted now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, now you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not working with Pertwee anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, uh, he wasn't interested after all in
looking at these for some reasons.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have, um, enlisted the services of
Miramal, Saz Moreno, who's over in,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, um, Spain to do those studies for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're working with a couple other
groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how much I can talk about
cause I'm under NDA.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, yeah, we're going to try to figure
out as much as we possibly can on the
[SPEAKER_10]: safety and efficacy of these things and
understand what the hydrogenation does to
[SPEAKER_10]: attenuate the activity of the
tetrahydrocannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: so the plant makes tetrahydrocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another chemical step to convert
them into hexahydrocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just in the series of
tetrahydrocannabinoids being able to
[SPEAKER_10]: undergo dehydrogenation up to cannabinol,
which is just the aromatic aromatization
[SPEAKER_10]: of the methyl cyclohexene ring.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've just reduced it, taken it down all
the way, you know, and, and HHC is
[SPEAKER_10]: something that, you know, has been
previously described and was previously
[SPEAKER_10]: looked at.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's known that it does undergo
metabolic oxidation similar to the,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, THC derivatives, but, you know,
they don't generate 11 hydroxy THC because
[SPEAKER_10]: the double bond's been reduced,
but there's a whole bunch of other things
[SPEAKER_10]: that we can do.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, hydrogenate some of these minor
cannabinoids as well, but just try to
[SPEAKER_10]: assess, you know, what is the impact that
hydrogenation extra chemical step has on
[SPEAKER_10]: the chemical modification of these already
biologically active compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: You say that it won't make 11 hydroxy upon
metabolization of the liver.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could actually be a hugely valuable,
um, pharmacokinetic property.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the biggest problem I have with,
uh, edibles and other people that I know
[SPEAKER_05]: that are said to be more sensitive to
edibles is that it turns to the lexy
[SPEAKER_05]: hydroxy metabolite in the liver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, the old hydroxy metabolites
unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not used to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you go from very uncomfortable if you
can get to knocked out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think that that experience I
think is completely different for a
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis user, someone who regularly uses
cannabis and whose body is already
[SPEAKER_10]: sensitized to that metabolite.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just more attenuated, I guess,
when it comes through the digestive tract,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and all in one burst,
you know, and gets into your blood.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it doesn't have the, you know,
it does have the CB one activity,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's generally thought of that it's
too polar and doesn't cross the blood
[SPEAKER_10]: brain barrier, which is why you get that
incredible body high.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you oversaturate all the other
cannabinoid receptors in your body,
[SPEAKER_10]: not your brain in your body.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I always tell people to keep
edibles in their mouth and suck on it like
[SPEAKER_10]: a, like a cough drop, you know,
don't let it go in your stomach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw in a little, uh, dehydration and
some jet lag from traveling to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_04]: and, uh, I've seen some people do some
face wallops right on the cobblestone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, we, a lot more people tried
the HHCA, you know, we were at the BizCon
[SPEAKER_10]: and so we got a lot more, uh, input on,
you know, how it makes people feel.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely there's a headiness and a high
to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's less intense than THC,
but definitely something that is
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely, um, um, modulated by terpenes,
just like you would expect a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_10]: to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing, the one thing I found about
it is it didn't have that same tingle of
[SPEAKER_07]: the head.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was because you've
hydrogenated all the terpenes as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the stuff that we made at BizCon,
the stuff that I made for BizCon was just
[SPEAKER_06]: HHCA from, from, uh, that starting
material was a THCA crystal.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was, there was, you guys gave me
two pens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the one, the first night that I
had my left of your hotel room was,
[SPEAKER_10]: um, uh, that was a year ago, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a year ago we made pens and those
were flavored with terp profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: What we brought this year was this stuff,
which is just, you know, this.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, we made the platinum cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We made, I took some platinum cookie sauce
and, uh, and hydrogenated it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We called it palladium cookies because
it's fucking genius, but the, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: the stuff was fucking tasty and
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had seen you guys there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was doing the whole fear and loathing
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was doing the Las Vegas thing this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: That place sucks, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, you should have hit me up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in the same room, I think in the
wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have hit me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wondered if you guys were there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had seen you now that I have
thought about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a full week next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vegas is a three day trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't, you can't do anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, but they're making it a whole
week now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when I went downtown for the
first time, I went down to old town,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I'd never been down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, someone, someone from California
had given me a little bit of, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: some psychedelics and man, those,
the way those analog lights move in old
[SPEAKER_07]: town is pretty funky.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually really liked old town.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was these, you know, these really
young card kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a African American kid that was doing
card tricks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really actually quite impressive
for such a young kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: He walked away with a bunch of our money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Card tricks, or are you getting caught on
like free card money or whatever?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like tricks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we were giving it to him freely.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was, he was doing some pretty
impressive stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would come up and he'd try to push you
in the car and that'd be, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you'd, you'd hammer down on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying, no, no, no, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hold the card deck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was actually really really
talented.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually quite impressed with the
kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we gave him a bunch of money and he
walked away and it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned around and I was like,
man, this kid was there with us for like
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 minutes and he walked away with 40
bucks at like 13, you know, pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got that Vegas hustle on.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sure did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he's going to be absolutely dangerous
when he's like 18 to 20, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, it looks like a pretty beautiful day
where you're sitting, Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And puppies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I'll do that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bright sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some technical difficulties getting
on and they're continuing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sitting on the patio, man,
next to a couple of the trees and enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight reflecting off the pond and
listening to some beautiful chat here.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the harvest done there, Wade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I did not have many plants this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hurt my back this spring and had to
learn how to be something other than a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, it's been a beautiful year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally got some rain and we're getting
the donations out to the kids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might actually achieve our goal of
being able to provide for those families
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's a whole bunch of people are
stepping up and we're not there yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, it feels like we'll make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, there was a couple of things I
wanted to talk about you guys were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking Hash Church,
one of the things, water process and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology that shows up in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for people who know a
lot more about these things than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your trichomes are clean of plant
material, if you do some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction to pull off any plant material
and just have trichomes, are things like
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus or bacterial growth going to be a
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know plant material in
trichomes, if you try and press it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with a bunch of little pockets
of plant material where moisture can
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate and fungus can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's clean of trichomes,
what's your story on that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_02]: If the plants are growing super clean and
there's not contamination from other
[SPEAKER_02]: sources, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But very seldom is plant really 100%
grown, 100% clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been playing with adding a step
to the extraction process, still using
[SPEAKER_00]: water bags, where I put an air stone into
the water that's rich in trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no longer has ice or the bulk of the
plant material in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by putting an air stone in it and a
little air, you get this wild foaming
[SPEAKER_00]: action that I've run through the bags and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There doesn't seem to be much in the way
of trichomes at all, but there's color,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material seems to come off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I like the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to throw that out there
because I like water process hash for my
[SPEAKER_00]: own personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems really important that it's
just trichomes, nothing else in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant material being clean is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then meantime, yeah, water,
I think is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most urban environments, I'll say it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got treated water coming through
pipes, that water at the minimum has
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine or chloramine in it, some sort of
way to keep the biology down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turns into a real nightmare when
you're trying to do soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow your own or have
a garden where you're encouraging soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, as soon as you use treated water,
you're killing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But meantime, to treat water, to get it so
you can use it without killing your
[SPEAKER_00]: biology is really problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking reverse osmosis or
extensive introductions of colonies of
[SPEAKER_00]: biology into the water until they've used
up, if you will, all the disinfectants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon my rambling here, but yeah,
those were two things that came really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me is the cleanliness of the
work that you're doing for your end users.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, I know I'm talking to
professionals, but for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your own work, for making your own
medicine, however it is, the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant material is really important
because the plant itself is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do any harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can't hurt you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your air stone concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always just used forced water and
rinsed it off, but that's a very good idea
[SPEAKER_04]: to just sort of bubble up the water and
clean any small little particulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if you're making water hash,
a very important component, which I could
[SPEAKER_04]: personally not imagine not having access
to as someone who makes water hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a macro lens or a microscope or
something that allows you to look very
[SPEAKER_04]: carefully and closely and really blow it
up on a 30-inch monitor, a 24-inch monitor
[SPEAKER_04]: so you can see what's going on in there
because there's really nothing like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can bioassay all day long and
think you know what's going on,
[SPEAKER_04]: but when you look at it and you see the
purity of it or the impurity of it for
[SPEAKER_04]: that matter, it really kind of lets you
know what's going on a little bit better
[SPEAKER_04]: than assuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like a 60 or 100 times
magnification for trichomes?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use a microscope like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a camera and it works on like true
macro, which is one, one, and then it goes
[SPEAKER_04]: to double that, which is two, one,
and it goes through three, one,
[SPEAKER_04]: four, one, and five, one, and then you can
crop those images as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never really know exactly how
detailed I am when I've gone in for the
[SPEAKER_04]: shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how magnified I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know if it's 200 or 300
or 150.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just really have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like getting close though, as close as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the secret also is start with
really clean plants, use really clean
[SPEAKER_02]: water, and then when you, when you made
the hash and separated it or the resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to dry it quickly so that it
doesn't become contaminated with
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiological, which it can be if you
dry it really slowly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think the, I think the truth there
is that it already is contaminated,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, life requires water.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing we know about life on
this planet is it requires water.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you're adding water in,
you're really giving it, it's like
[SPEAKER_07]: germinating a seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're kind of kickstarting the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's really quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good to be fast, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: In getting that that product dried out,
however you do it by... Well, if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial, you're making it for a
marketplace, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: lyophilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a freeze dryer,
whether it's a pharmaceutical grade or a
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory grade, or even a home version.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to remove the moisture content
out under vacuum in a way that you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: that hash really, really properly dry,
at least void of all moisture and go from
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, otherwise, microbials are going to
get you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it should be lyophilized.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how many people are actually
doing that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think that's probably one of
the problem is, is that you have water and
[SPEAKER_07]: this life starts to multiply, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you, when they're doing
these, you know, microbial tests,
[SPEAKER_07]: essentially where they measure the amount
of microbial activity or the amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: colony forming units, and you don't
differentiate between the different
[SPEAKER_07]: species, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the failures of these type
of testing is that you could, you might
[SPEAKER_07]: have sure some kind of microbiology that's
above the, you know, the safe or the
[SPEAKER_07]: recognized colony forming units,
but those colonies themselves aren't toxic
[SPEAKER_07]: or dangerous, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to have tests that actually
accurately reflect the, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the potential harm of the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was just in Manitoba, I went and
visited a, one of the largest hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: processors in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can de-haul 5,000 pounds of hemp parts
or hemp seeds into hemp parts every hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the facility was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had like a hundred thousand liters of
oil in the building.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very impressive, massive quantities
of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, he took me up to his lab where
they were, you know, measuring colony
[SPEAKER_04]: forming units and they were doing E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli tests and they were doing mold and
yeast tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool to walk through and check out
and just see how, how they go about doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get video of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He, he didn't, it's a lot of it is his
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he, he didn't, I got some photos I
can show you personally, but I didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing that I can, that I can share
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great facility though.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy had it going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I'm just going to jump in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to, I got to bounce out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got some, some plans.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will, I will see you guys in the future
and hopefully see you guys bunch you at a
[SPEAKER_06]: great day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's good to have Chris in like that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see the hexahydra cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the hexahydra cookies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just great to have him as a
collaborator on that project.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's able to, you know, make some
samples to get, you know, things,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, out there in the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're taking, um, we have hydrogenated CBD
that we're actually going to be putting
[SPEAKER_10]: into dairy products and look for the
impact that it has on shelf life and
[SPEAKER_10]: stability and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at it as a functional ingredient for
food.
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as nutritional.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All kinds of stuff to do there.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that, Indra?
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, are you pouring it into milk or
are you feeding it to the cows?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're putting it into dairy fats and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to see exactly what it does to
enhance, you know, resistant to oxidative
[SPEAKER_10]: breakdown.
[SPEAKER_10]: So sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your dog wants to be on hash church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch out for lecithin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, the, it can be the accelerant
that can really amp up the THC
[SPEAKER_05]: exponentially in the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: So be aware of that because it just breaks
it down so much that the body's uptake is
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty bad ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I added that when I was like,
uh, years ago when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: bond losses, that's the thing that I would
add.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that you're talking about adding it
to dairy and things like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's actually one of the things
we're, we're looking to count on,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is an enhanced uptake, you know,
so using that effect that I think that
[SPEAKER_10]: happens, you know, across the family of,
uh, you know, variety of different things
[SPEAKER_10]: like lecithins and you know, fatty acids
and triglycerides, which all facilitate
[SPEAKER_10]: transport of these very hydrophobic
molecules into biological tissue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I recently met a scientist,
a chemistry guy who has some nano
[SPEAKER_04]: emulsification process using silver and he
uses like these nanites that are like a
[SPEAKER_04]: seven nanometers in length.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colloidal silver or just silver?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a colloidal silver,
but what he does is he can, he can turn on
[SPEAKER_04]: or turn off the hydrophobic or hydrophobic
nature of a molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can either make it attract or repel
with this, with this process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus he has claims both with the FDA and
with health Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he has like health claims that he can
make, and he's looking to make deals with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, people that might want to,
uh, to engage with cannabinoids and gain
[SPEAKER_04]: the use of those claims that are near
impossible to get if you were just to try
[SPEAKER_04]: and get those claims, his, the health
claims, like they, they use this stuff in
[SPEAKER_04]: surgery and open wounds and they,
it's dentistry and all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_04]: things, but very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go meet him, I think next
week and talk to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he German?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he might be, I would have to check the
email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He could be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I met these German guys last year
that were doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some nanotechnology related to
silver and they were trying to get us to
[SPEAKER_07]: spray it on plants on cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is not a good idea because it
interferes with ethylene, but you're also
[SPEAKER_07]: not allowed to do it under the health
Canada regulations, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just spray it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this was to, this was to put into like
cannabinoids and this product to put it
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a whole crazy deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, uh, I can't say the name of his
company, but, uh, it was a project that
[SPEAKER_04]: embark was looking at.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean colloidal silver has been used in
antimicrobial coatings for Kuhn's age and
[SPEAKER_10]: everything from shopping cart handles to
surfaces at the airport are, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: coded with, I think the product used to be
called Alpha San or micro band and it's,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, it's colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if you're talking nano silver now,
it's not colloidal anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause you're talking about a particular
size machine, colloidal just means some
[SPEAKER_10]: big particle agglomerate, but I usually
think of those kinds of things as being
[SPEAKER_10]: not good in general for cannabis
operations because they have very broad
[SPEAKER_10]: spectrum, you know, antimicrobial
activity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you know, the plant relies on
microbial activity for the fixation of
[SPEAKER_10]: nitrogen and other essential, you know,
biochemical reactions that have to happen
[SPEAKER_10]: where if you knock out some of the lower
rungs on the food ladder, which is what
[SPEAKER_10]: those broad spectrum things do,
um, you would just destabilize the natural
[SPEAKER_10]: balance of microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: No need to spray silver on your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this wasn't that this was something
totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was as in taking cannabinoids and
then putting them together after you've
[SPEAKER_04]: grown the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: After you've extracted it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's all kinds of people doing
nano and all kinds of different sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: formulations to, you know, put these very
hydrophobic molecules into, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: water and water based formulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, there's again, just many
different ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, ATN mentioned lecithin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, lecithin is one, you know,
sort of naturally occurring material that
[SPEAKER_10]: can be used, but there's any number of
materials.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be used ultimately.
[SPEAKER_16]: Did Robin Williams get the first patent on
nanonano technology?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nanonano?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Sam, that was terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really, really can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Help yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have carte blanche here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably took me like two or three
years to get into the frequency to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to, to not miss Sam's jokes because they
would often go over my head or under my
[SPEAKER_04]: feet or beside by, I was just like,
but then when I got it, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: man, this guy has like the craziest,
driest, sickest humor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take dry humor and then take it to a
desert.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look, look past the oasis and bear it
with humor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab it through a lyophilizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you have to do is dry sift it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to turn it into the 99.9% dry
humor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's concentrated dry humor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then hydrogenated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some, a little bit of rosin here,
but got a lot of smell and taste that I
[SPEAKER_02]: like it, but I'm about to run out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some nice full melt dry sift you
would like here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody called for a BR yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited D420K and he never came in,
but, uh, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not even imitatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even imitate him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother lovers.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I feel like it's scripted and
we're all just playing our parts in a
[SPEAKER_04]: movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so, so insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy in this guy wrote the script.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrote the script.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Hey, I want to talk hemp and
janitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just came from the hemp conference,
so I'm ready to have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, Sam, I saw Jace Calloway.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said to say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so in California, uh, we've just,
you know, we've got this cannabis set of
[SPEAKER_00]: laws with insane kinds of regulations for
every sort of activity in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then we also have this separate
industry called hemp and basically they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using similar plants and yeah,
there's the whole registry thing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were discussing earlier, but in trying to
learn how this is going to work on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the real world, one of the things that
I've realized has become really important
[SPEAKER_00]: is that cannabis in California is
regulated under the business and
[SPEAKER_00]: professions code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas hemp is in the food and
agricultural code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the food and agricultural code,
cannabis as hemp enjoys all the
[SPEAKER_00]: protections of the right to farm act,
which, uh, carries all kinds of weight in
[SPEAKER_00]: California for agriculture and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, uh, yeah, there's all kinds
of questions that come into play for a
[SPEAKER_00]: person like for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I have six personal use plants
growing on my property, if they happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: be hemp type plants, I'm actually breaking
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're high THC plants that don't have
that, that they have more than
[SPEAKER_00]: three-tenths of a percent THC,
then they are cannabis and I even allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, well that's the way it is in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow at least a 10th of an
acre of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about the California food
and ag code.
[SPEAKER_00]: On hemp says you have to grow at least a
10th of an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if it's, if they're cannabis
plants, if I call them cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have six on my property.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, they have to be indoors,
but that's a whole nother conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's fascinating to me that in
law, we're trying to take the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and say, some of them are going to
be ag products, commodities, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and meantime, there's the whole question
of most of the people in California who
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing CBD are doing hemp want to do
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But meantime, the, the folks who regulate
cannabis, uh, the BCC have said you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: sell CBD as hemp to any human.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell it in Canada, California as
a cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go through a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to go through the track and
trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, to me, it's just an example of
regulation gone awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really it's, it's, it's nonsensical,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost Alice in wonderland kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got for the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm fascinated to hear any other
points of view about this, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the crux of it is in California is an ag
product and all the rest of cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: business and professions code sort of
thing, all kinds of regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the dragon fly earth medicine
in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: You, uh, you all had talked a little bit
about the Canadian hemp codes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that, you know, that hemp has
always been part of like a bigger ag
[SPEAKER_11]: situation with, uh, with the seeds and the
fiber.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's moving into a medicinal and
now, you know, you have, uh, farms that
[SPEAKER_11]: are out west that are mostly concerned on,
on CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have hemp farms out in the
prairies like Manitoba, where,
[SPEAKER_11]: where Marcus was where they're still
totally focused on fiber and seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: So really I don't think the government has
the capability of, of, of getting their
[SPEAKER_11]: systems up to date as fast as the plant is
changing and as fast as all the farmers
[SPEAKER_11]: are making discoveries.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're making all these discoveries
along with, you know, these amazing
[SPEAKER_11]: scientists and laboratories that we're
working with and, and the laws they,
[SPEAKER_11]: they just are, they're like a stagnant
creature that can't keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, it's almost really difficult to
manage that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bummed out about it at Embark
because we want hemp farmers to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow high cannabinoid content cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because we're looking at processing 10
plus thousand pounds per day, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: we need, we need large numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're not just going to be able to
toll process for, for LP.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're more interested in getting material
from either greenhouse grower
[SPEAKER_04]: relationships that we make ourselves,
or, you know, being able to get it out of
[SPEAKER_04]: country and producing crude oil and
shipping it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ideally getting, getting them from
Canadian farmers that are able to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand, cause this is another thing
that a lot of Canadian farmers don't
[SPEAKER_04]: understand right now is that when you're
going to grow for cannabinoid content,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not going to grow for seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of them right now think that this
is a, this cannabinoid thing CBD in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular is, is an added value that they
can just process their crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I personally like it's, it's difficult
to, to process hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like two and 1% returns.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not, when you have the ability
to process so much, you're better off
[SPEAKER_04]: processing a cannabinoid content that's,
you know, above 8% and ideally above 20%.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our brother here in Eugene area.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just grew a strain called the lifter
this year and got 23.5% on his outdoor
[SPEAKER_11]: lifter.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's really, really stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's the lab said it was the highest
of the season.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there, there's some, it's a beautiful
flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a jar of it right here and it's
got an incredible flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Highest of the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picture there some huge Harvard
celebration and he gets to sit in this
[SPEAKER_04]: hand-carved chair above everyone else and
carried through the, a chair made of hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: stocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, of course you have won the
highest of the year.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no doubt he's really stoked about
it, but it does have a really amazing wide
[SPEAKER_11]: variety of turpines as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a hybrid of the special sauce
from last year from the Crawford brothers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of, a lot of new strains happening
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really interesting to see how they
turn out.
[SPEAKER_11]: This year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause one of my videos went viral recently
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my video of where I press half a
pound of where's my bike from Karma
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I make 60 grams of a rosin and it's
just gone viral.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got like three or 400,000 views in
the last like couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a well over a million views now,
like 1.4 or something, but it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's an incredible to see people watch a
video where a plant can return 29% dry
[SPEAKER_04]: weight of oil to bud and have people after
person, after person, after person say
[SPEAKER_04]: that bud was bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was mid grade herb because where's my
bike doesn't look all shiny in LA and
[SPEAKER_04]: fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, it really looks almost like an
outdoor, even when grown indoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: it looks, even if you're, you trim it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it just kind of looks a little not
that great of a herb, but it's truly a
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect example of herb that you cannot
judge.
[SPEAKER_04]: By its cover because the contents of
cannabinoid and terpenes that it produces
[SPEAKER_04]: that are actually on point and worth
hitting, like they're strong and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: clear and they're tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, it's kind of a winning
combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a little far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a little far from your mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm right next to my mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it sounded.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you, but you cut out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what I was asking was, did you put it
in any kind of a desiccator or oven or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything to try and dry it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: No,
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not, but it definitely didn't change
much that first batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stayed very consistent and,
and, and sort of pull and snappy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did run some recently that buttered out
immediately and we, we, we weighed it,
[SPEAKER_04]: buttered out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's I've got, I made about 400 grams of
it recently, a big pock of where's my
[SPEAKER_04]: bike, uh, rosin, just putting it through
the, the pure pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing is like a workhorse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a few bags left here
still, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, they're over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few that I didn't, I didn't process yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got them in with the Boveda.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't dry out, but I've got about,
uh, 10 bags in here, each with 35 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: This batch was the first batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who does it smell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first batch that, um,
I blew bags with herb and I've never had
[SPEAKER_04]: herb that is so hard that it blows the
bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had hash do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with these particular batches,
I had to close the plates, let it sit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit on the herb at about 20 PSI for a
solid 30 seconds to a minute and basically
[SPEAKER_04]: wait until it just started juicing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I could apply a higher,
uh, you know, amp up the, the PSI on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, on the toggle switch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, if I came down the way I pressed
my last batch of where's my bike,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just came down with full PSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would squish it and I'd get a nine to
10 gram, uh, return each time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nevermind the naysayers.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you pay any attention to them,
I'll drag you down to the mud with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the naysayers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I so like obsessed with replying to
the naysayers?
[SPEAKER_04]: I find I get caught up in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm like, I'm only going to reply
to positive comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: People that are asking, you know,
information like what songs on the video
[SPEAKER_04]: or they actually want to learn something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm answering them first, not the guys
that, uh, that are slamming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, cause you're a truth seer and you
can see through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's part of the realities
of what we face when you're pioneering and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're creating your own trail as,
you know, as Andrew says, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just carry on, do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't, if everybody listened on
this panel to what everybody else thinks,
[SPEAKER_05]: there would be no panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of us would be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've all bucked our own system in
reality along the way to where we're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've, I can make a better path.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all established that many,
much in many things to that man,
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam there for establishing a lot of the
reality that we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Andrea always thank me for your
medicine because I still use it daily and
[SPEAKER_05]: your creation has changed my life for the
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank you both.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I got Dr. Don't cause he gave me the
advice to get it certified in a bunch of
[SPEAKER_13]: different ways, way back when I wasn't
really buying into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it ended up exactly that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now our equipment is fully certified
under those guidelines in every state in
[SPEAKER_13]: the country and then every country
actually right around the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's because I finally started
listening to his advice about how to go
[SPEAKER_13]: about doing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the whole thing, the, all the stuff
that's happening now, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's, we have two installed and they're
being used and people that are using
[SPEAKER_13]: sanely happy with them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're using it more than one thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the users of it is actually
spending a few days a week doing hemp and
[SPEAKER_13]: then a couple of days a week doing other
stuff like fragrance stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's doing a lot of speeds and he just
recently did a number of seeds,
[SPEAKER_13]: which are very interesting and it should
prove to be quite the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so now we're also going to come out
with the small one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got the prototype getting ready to
come and way back when in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_13]: I promised Mark one of the small ones we
could use for research.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I haven't forgotten that just that we
don't have one exactly ready yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just gave me the first mock up of it
wanting to know if I wanted anything
[SPEAKER_13]: changed on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I submitted the drawings to PSI and
PSI said it's a go.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we're going to start producing
those.
[SPEAKER_13]: One's going to go to Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: One's going to go to Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: One's going to go to Wade and that whole
scenario there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's going to happen to the first
three of those small ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're also going to come out with a
double size one now and a triple size one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Triple size it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for a quad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for a quad.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all certified from minus 200
centigrade to plus 224 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good range, you got to admit.
[SPEAKER_13]: That should be able to allow you to get
whatever kind of extraction you're
[SPEAKER_13]: seeking.
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, it's been a long drawn out
trail.
[SPEAKER_13]: And once again, I just want to say thanks
to Mark.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about time I did something useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hydrogenating shit like crazy,
bro.
Low battery.
Low battery.
[SPEAKER_15]: Low battery.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, nothing like a hydrogenation thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a very interesting path
myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some things going to come out from
me this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them I want to do right here on the
show with you and I want you to premier it
[SPEAKER_13]: and show it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always down.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been very supportive ever since I
met you, which is way the fuck back then.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually if we would have gotten a
little more together things then instead
[SPEAKER_13]: of just letting everything go by the
wayside, you and I would probably be
[SPEAKER_13]: multimillionaires right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Based off what we missed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that really what you want?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it would be nice to pay for plane
tickets mostly, but I could do with with
[SPEAKER_04]: or without.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mostly just want at this point in time,
I won't lie, to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like top notch number uno.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, but it is an incredibly
high percentage of the people I know who
[SPEAKER_02]: became very wealthy became real assholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could say along the lines, although I do
know some great people that have been very
[SPEAKER_04]: successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a mic there, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Daniel from Whistler Technologies
and Whistler Medical up in Pembe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why he's muted, but he'll
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were talking earlier about
microbials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And water hash and the problem down in
California actually weighed the friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: looking bearded fellow in the corner with
the green hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was he was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was I was a man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish Daniel was in here right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could be talking a little bit about
what we're doing at Whistler Technologies
[SPEAKER_04]: and trying to sort of take into account
those those infamous microbials that love
[SPEAKER_04]: to fail water hashes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we we've been doing some tests.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been testing with Whistler Medical,
and we've seen pretty good micro results
[SPEAKER_09]: for the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't seen any hash fail yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've even seen hash pass that the dry the
bud from the same lot had a higher
[SPEAKER_09]: microbial count.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems the freeze drying did help a lot,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were talking about that,
that freeze drying is going to be pretty,
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty essential to getting that water out
as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: We make the ice with RO water.
[SPEAKER_09]: And cleaning your ice machine regularly,
because even with the RO water,
[SPEAKER_09]: you get this like pink slime that builds
up in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So cleaning out all your water and ice
equipment helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only time we used commercially
available ice, we failed micro like
[SPEAKER_09]: terribly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's saying a lot right there,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the pink that's in that pink slime
is a is iron from the hardness of your
[SPEAKER_10]: water.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that pink is usually like we see it
every once in a while in our ice tray when
[SPEAKER_10]: we clean it out to that whole apparatus in
there develops what's I guess it's not a
[SPEAKER_10]: living bio, but it's just what's called a
biofilm, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So biofilm begins to, you know,
foul commercial ice makers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's definitely worth, you know,
looking into how you can clean those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you definitely got to control and
condition your water and your ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like snow when you can get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend up in Pemberton has made amazing
bubble for years going up to Black Tusk
[SPEAKER_04]: and collecting ice up there in the in the
snow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking the other day that all the
outdoor in Lillooet, there should be a
[SPEAKER_09]: cold storage facility that's just like up
in the alpine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when November hits, you can just like
bring it up to a warehouse that doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: actually have cooling and then process
into hash up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they need to do at the ski
huts that aren't working out ski lodges.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just turn them into hash lodges.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know some good hash or I'm already
calling it a hash lodge that have really
[SPEAKER_11]: amazing micro hydro situations on them
because they're way up in the mountains
[SPEAKER_11]: next to a giant creek.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're making all their own
electricity and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm picturing a really cool Whistler
technologies, sort of commercial or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, video brochure, you know,
whipping it up in that little cabin on the
[SPEAKER_04]: top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be so sick.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there is there's a way to make
bubble hash without water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, we know, John, we know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mentioned it solves a lot of the water
problems if you don't use water for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're focused on using water,
it's it definitely makes a very good,
[SPEAKER_04]: good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no denying that bubble hash is not
going to go away anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always going to be new ways that
come out that are that are exceptional.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just we'll adapt along with them
for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been it's it's had its place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I don't feel that it's going away.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was at the cup last year,
a bunch of different people turned me on
[SPEAKER_13]: to their bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: I still have stashes of some of it because
I made it out to myself very sparingly.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's such a nice high.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's room for every kind of way
of deriving the natural products that
[SPEAKER_13]: exist in the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people are going to find unique
methods and ways of seeing and
[SPEAKER_13]: understanding how it all works.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I made my first extraction my first
gas extraction in 1970.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was when I first saw THCA
crystals.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a it was literally by
serendipity, because when I made that gas
[SPEAKER_13]: extraction, I left gas in the oil in a
jar.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I woke up in the morning,
I found the THCA crystals.
[SPEAKER_13]: So THCA crystals.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's no new innovation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw it happen in front of my eyes in
1970.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a bunch of other things because I was
extracting a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in 1998, I left it on the web.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that other people could experiment and
find out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, a lot of people did the
wrong thing with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's a lot of to be found out yet,
because I know a lot of things and I don't
[SPEAKER_13]: hear anybody talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and I'm sure it's because no one
has discovered that particular method or
[SPEAKER_13]: that particular derivative of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I still wait to see every day.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many creative people doing so
many creative things that I expect
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that I've seen already up till
now to start just naturally appearing in
[SPEAKER_13]: the biome of all the people who live on
Earth, because we all share all these
[SPEAKER_13]: sensations and feelings all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm pretty sure that some people
are just going to get that vibration and
[SPEAKER_13]: tune into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And these things will change out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the more the more people have access
to like, you know, if you're one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: lucky people in life that you have had an
enormous amount of access to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to play around with it,
you can discover things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much harder to discover things if you
don't have an enormous access to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: of quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got started in Vietnam and I was busy.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you were in Vietnam, you were
considered in a combat zone.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could send mail back to the USA with
no customs and no inspection.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I sent my mother 37 Sanyo
refrigerators, those little coolers that
[SPEAKER_13]: you use for drinks, full of Thai stick and
Buddhist stick.
[SPEAKER_13]: And stuff that I bought while I was in
Vietnam, because before I went to Vietnam,
[SPEAKER_13]: my mom said, don't smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, OK, I won't.
[SPEAKER_13]: But by chance under fire, somebody gave me
some when I smoked it and I was it calmed
[SPEAKER_13]: me way down.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, what's that?
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said pot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, oh, shit, I promised mom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, anyway, I sent mom back 37 of these
refrigerators because I was afraid I
[SPEAKER_13]: wouldn't be able to find pot back in the
States.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I knew that they weren't inspecting
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I, you know, I had a lot of it that was
very good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had all the seeds from that in case
you're getting ready to ask them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a plethora of all that stuff
from that time, because mostly out of
[SPEAKER_13]: paranoia that I wouldn't be able to get it
back in the States.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did have a lot of that and I did
experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did a lot of extractions at that
point.
[SPEAKER_13]: And time.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it wasn't conducive to spreading it
around.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Internet didn't really open up to
1998.
[SPEAKER_13]: When it did, I published it online on
several places.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, you know, I wish only the best for
the community.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know that there's some things that
nobody has looked at yet because if they
[SPEAKER_13]: did, I would have heard about it if
nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on a hash search.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time for a rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just heard D420K scream bong rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bong rip, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one sounded pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get that deep in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to get the grit.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, hello, Jen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Indra.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I wanted to say, too,
is that, you know, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grower, a lot of experimentations and
a lot of original thought come from
[SPEAKER_01]: failures, you know, different kind of crop
failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're growing thousands of
plants, you know, out in the bush is where
[SPEAKER_01]: it all started for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, crop failures or maybe something
seeding out or, you know, you have a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: mass of snow and ice storm, you know,
in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it forces you to really have to think
outside of the box and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions and original thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come from growers, you know, that have had
different types of failures and successes
[SPEAKER_01]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Failure is the mother of invention.
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about moving further south,
eh?
[SPEAKER_13]: Those snowstorms in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but those snowstorms really helped
us out, you know, in creating a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of our different strains that we have
going on and really thankful for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which plants made it out of the snowstorm
and which ones didn't is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: enlightening thing to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't trade Canada for the south
for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bonsai teacher who says you won't
learn anything until you kill your first
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes along that sentiment,
you know, and it takes seven years to
[SPEAKER_05]: master each type of tree, they say,
which is also applicable because each type
[SPEAKER_05]: of genetic takes a while for you and a few
years for you to understand by growing it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it failing and it parts of it dying
and then getting it nursing it back to
[SPEAKER_05]: health, et cetera, et cetera, so that you
learn to see the signs as well as,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what is the optimization that
you can get from that particular genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fascinating this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, you know,
talking a lot about microbials,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, today and microbial counts and
the DNA and all of that sort of stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: it is that a lot of that testing,
you know, that you start to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your crops, you know, it comes from,
oh, geez, I've got something going on and
[SPEAKER_01]: what can I spray on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I spray on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of recipes can I utilize?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to harm it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to hurt it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's really where Josh and
I, you know, thrive is actually from a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of our failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we had our very,
very first broad might a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: we took that broad might and then we
studied it, you know, for nine weeks and
[SPEAKER_01]: really found out everything there was to
find out about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of sprays worked?
[SPEAKER_01]: What didn't, you know, and in the end,
you know, as far as talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials, we're back to heat treatment
over and over again so that microbials
[SPEAKER_01]: really aren't a part of the conversation
as far as cultivation goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been really thankful for our
failures to learn a lot and our successes
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But through through our huge successes and
failures, we've been able to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: education and help people out so that they
can also be successful.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to learn a thing, teach it and
the backward wave from that will teach you
[SPEAKER_13]: everything there is to know about that
subject.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to learn anatomy when I was going
to pre-med school and I was utterly
[SPEAKER_13]: failing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so difficult and someone gave me
that advice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I started a class teaching people
who even knew less than I about anatomy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And by a year later, I was a fantastic
anatomist.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can discuss everything from the level of
the pzm of the bone all the way out.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it took me wanting to teach it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So your effort of teaching is a powerful
back wave to your own learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in full agreement with that statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see Wade is as well as he nods
his head in affirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I wanted to jump in and share a
little story.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about failure and learning
from failure, when Harlequin first
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, the group of patients in the
collective that I had in those days,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually every person in the group that
got some of those early flowers said,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I like the way it looks,
love the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it doesn't get me stoned,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: But one person, one person in that whole
group said his shoulder that he had torn
[SPEAKER_00]: up playing football in school had hurt so
much since he had metal parts put in and
[SPEAKER_00]: his shoulder hurt so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been in and out of opioid rehab a
bunch of times trying to kick painkillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, it's the damnedest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke a joint of this shit and it
doesn't hurt anymore, Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I got it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, yeah, up until I got it
tested, Harlequin looked like a disaster
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had a whole room, not just a
room, a building, just to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: a building full of these plants and none
of the people that were going to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: them wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, in terms of learning what Indra
was saying about teaching, trying to share
[SPEAKER_00]: the information that each of us has
learned in this kind of a context here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hash Church, it's part of what I love
about the opportunity to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going out into your community,
normalizing our work, helping people
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that we're not criminals,
we're not out to hurt the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not out to hurt kids, we're
restoring this plant, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: to its rightful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of what I appreciate about,
Marcus, you framing this conversation as
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Church is church implies a certain
religious or spiritual point of view about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, for one, feel a religious,
if not passionate missionary zeal about
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that this plant can't hurt you
and that as we learn more about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with this plant, we start seeing
really miraculous things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it is a miracle plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, in fact, as the Rastas say,
the healing of the peoples.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd like to think of it as peace on
that one, ah-ho.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah-ho.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a fractal medicine because,
you know, everything that you do to it,
[SPEAKER_11]: it fractals out into, you know,
a different form.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even within the learning of it,
you know, it's a fractal of learning
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's such an adaptogenic,
you know, plant that there's just so much
[SPEAKER_11]: variation to it that it's like a beautiful
story that, you know, you just keep
[SPEAKER_11]: learning about and it's just unfolding in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything you just said brings to
mind that it's almost, in a way,
[SPEAKER_11]: now with all the legalization and stuff,
that we're almost going back into a
[SPEAKER_11]: private thing with IEPs and everything and
almost going into, you know, a protective
[SPEAKER_11]: way.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's almost the opposite of
teaching.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like as recreational and
legalization was coming, there was a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of openness and a lot of people sharing
and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're almost moving into a
protective, you know, IEP state.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I get why that is on a lot of levels
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just, you know, that's part of what
we're doing with the peer certification is
[SPEAKER_11]: just keeping knowledge out there and just
keeping the inspiration out there so
[SPEAKER_11]: people can continue to learn.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with you that thank you,
Marcus, you know, for everything you've
[SPEAKER_11]: done to keep this going.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's exciting for us to learn from
people all over, you know, meeting Daniel
[SPEAKER_11]: and Whistler and seeing everything he's
doing and having an opportunity to be in
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson and going through Eugene here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're on our way to Arcata Beneficial
Living Center and Southern Humboldt to
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpenglow and down to Covillo for the
Sunroots Farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're just doing a big tour of farms
so that we can continue learning and we
[SPEAKER_11]: can share, you know, what we're learning
with everyone, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're on the mission of, you know,
connecting good people and good products
[SPEAKER_11]: and also just the learning train.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the most important thing
that, you know, sort of to add on to what
[SPEAKER_01]: you were saying, Wade, is that we are
entering a global market and it absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: is imperative for the people and the
businesses who have a really tight
[SPEAKER_01]: connection with this plant to join
together, to, you know, make a stance when
[SPEAKER_01]: we go into the global market, because
right now in Oregon, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're dealing with an island here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't sell outside of their island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people who have had really
long time relationships with this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and who have been cultivating it or
concentrating it for a long time have
[SPEAKER_01]: either had to step out or had to step way
back from their involvement with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just are really encouraging those
people to stay involved with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be through education or whether
it be through your business, because when
[SPEAKER_01]: it does go to a large global market,
you know, the people who have had
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships with the plants are going to
shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's imperative that we
continue our education.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds all perfect to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be able to gather on a
Sunday morning and sort of just get into
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it is funny because I really chose
that church.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, I named it Hash Church
for the simple reason that I hit this
[SPEAKER_04]: milestone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was allowed to suddenly stream and it
was like eight o'clock or eight thirty on
[SPEAKER_04]: a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, OK, what would I call my
show?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, well, we used to gather for
Sundays and we'd call the church not Jesus
[SPEAKER_04]: Church, but actual cannabis church.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to meet at my friend Amir's
restaurant that was right across the
[SPEAKER_04]: street from the melting point,
my gallery.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we called it church.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought, here I am all these years
later, very focused on hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll call it Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I even called the first one like a
Sunday morning hash church with bubble man
[SPEAKER_04]: or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had no idea I would do it like one
hundred and seventy more times in a row
[SPEAKER_04]: with all of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's neat that church happened
to be in the name because it is very much
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of a spiritual guiding light that in
my life for for the last 25 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely followed it down some
pretty cool corridors, down some very cool
[SPEAKER_04]: paths.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there just seems to be an endless
amount of paths.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this fractal infinity of amounts
of directions it can take you and
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm always excited about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing I like about cannabis is
that in my work with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can now start getting excited about all
these other things, whether it's growing
[SPEAKER_04]: acres in Jamaica and processing or whether
it's building this giant lab here in D.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: or working with Whistler Technologies to
bring new technologies to light and
[SPEAKER_04]: helping commercialize that water
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always excited about it because
cannabis is involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I end up in some situations that if
cannabis wasn't there, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this would be pretty boring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm just in a big manufacturing plant
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be super stoked on this if it
wasn't for the fact that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing like hemp products,
like oils and protein powder isolates and
[SPEAKER_04]: all of these different things that
suddenly, you know, I walk into a room and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's just like, I don't know how many
hundreds of thousands of pounds of seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: just in these giant totes that are taller
than me and, you know, huge, like five
[SPEAKER_04]: feet round.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just got a giant room full of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, man, this is this is
exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love I love working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I think it's one of the
reasons we're all very lucky to be
[SPEAKER_04]: involved in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things people ask me often
is how can I get involved in this industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and how do you answer that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just get involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do you guys have good advice for
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I always am like, I'm always like,
follow your passion, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what to say in regards
to how do you get into the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: because all I did was just start growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to know the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, don't get arrested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get arrested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get a felony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get a felony more than anything else
is most important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put together a resume, you know,
go down to find these distributors,
[SPEAKER_05]: find these people volunteer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I got I got involved in this
because Cannabis Action Network was an all
[SPEAKER_05]: volunteer organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just started showing up and giving
my time and my time on the phone calling
[SPEAKER_05]: people was very boring initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that led to me then being on the
street corner, then being on the street
[SPEAKER_05]: corner, then allowed me to then be on rock
and roll tours and then doing hemp tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing you know, I get hired by a
company who's like, hey, you've been out
[SPEAKER_05]: on the road and you know what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know about this plant hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So come work for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then couldn't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then came back to California and have been
involved in medical cannabis ever since.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just takes a chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be honest with yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the chances.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you really love and care about it,
you'll find a way to plug in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, there's lots of organizations
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's college every there's
college campuses that have organizations.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's not one, you can get in contact
with MPP, SSDP, Students for Sensible Drug
[SPEAKER_05]: Policy, MAPS, they'll all help you set up
chapters on your university so you can
[SPEAKER_05]: find other like minded people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we did where we would go
around then to free speech areas on
[SPEAKER_05]: college campuses in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been through 47 states doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've done it firsthand and I wasn't
paid for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I volunteered my time, but they paid our
money, our food and our travel and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one of those realities that you
just have to sometimes take the chance and
[SPEAKER_05]: get out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are companies hiring all
throughout California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the Bureau of Cannabis Control is
hiring needs to hire a thousand people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need inspectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need people to go out, you know,
and look and regionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's all areas around the state that
they're going to need regional
[SPEAKER_05]: coordinators.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, those may have some sort of
educational requirements, but there's
[SPEAKER_05]: different ways that you can plug in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only giving California as an example
because that's the example that I have
[SPEAKER_05]: currently and that I've used.
[SPEAKER_05]: But find people, get in there,
be honest, be trustworthy, be forthright,
[SPEAKER_05]: be honest, and anything can happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can end up just like one of us
and be on the panel one day, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also say that learn about
something that you're interested in
[SPEAKER_09]: because that knowledge is really powerful
and that's how you get into a place you
[SPEAKER_09]: want to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever your passion is, learn about
it and then display that knowledge and go
[SPEAKER_09]: meet people in the industry, as everyone
else has said, and just get out there
[SPEAKER_09]: because the more you learn, the more
you're going to be able to help people or
[SPEAKER_09]: help yourself, and you'll get where you
want to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also regional, like National
Cannabis Industries Association now has
[SPEAKER_05]: regional quarterly meetings in certain
states and areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can go down and meet people and rub
elbows with local business owners,
[SPEAKER_05]: ask them questions, ask ways how you can
plug in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most importantly is, yes, if you want
to get involved seriously, if you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a grower, then you can go to college
and actually get degrees in botany and
[SPEAKER_05]: biology, as well as chemistry,
as the doctor will tell you, because these
[SPEAKER_05]: are all things that we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need researchers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have research enough to last for
generations, right, Docs?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have literally generations of just from
hemp alone, I mean, high grade cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: all that type of research needs to be done
as well as we need to set up a germ plasma
[SPEAKER_05]: institute in North America, which we need
stewards and growers and seed producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all those realities are still yet to
see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those are realities that have to take
place in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're watching, there's still ways
for you to plug in and be part of that
[SPEAKER_05]: future reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked all those answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely they kind of were unique
because they were like each of your
[SPEAKER_04]: versions of kind of how you went about
doing what you had to do to get into this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say, Wade's was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, grow cannabis, grow it,
get to know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, really, that is like so simple
and yet so completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, grow cannabis now attached to
Mark who worked in the non cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry right for years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you said, Mark, you walk into a plan
and if you're making sneakers or you're
[SPEAKER_10]: making rubber for the end of the sneaker,
whatever your your fit, your plants
[SPEAKER_10]: making, it's not as exciting as making
hash or medicine for people and around the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant we love.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was just lucky and fortunate to
intersect my passion with what I can do
[SPEAKER_10]: for a living.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's always a wonderful thing to be
able to put those two things together.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a constructive interference
pattern that where you get a greater
[SPEAKER_10]: superposition and you'll be farther along
than you would be if you did any one of
[SPEAKER_10]: those things individually.
[SPEAKER_10]: But together, those things push you to
places that you may never have been.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in terms of failure, I mean,
it's kind of like you'll learn.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the scientific method is like you want
to probe something about some phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you design a hypothesis and experiment
to answer the question.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you run the experiment,
collect the data and come up with the
[SPEAKER_10]: conclusion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, as a scientist who's run
thousands of experiments that totally
[SPEAKER_10]: failed, that's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how you define the moment of
invention, because as soon as something
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't fail, you know what failures look
like, because you've seen that like a
[SPEAKER_10]: hundred times.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as soon as you put something together
that totally is now, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: something new.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's that aha moment that,
you know, yeah, I've done something
[SPEAKER_10]: completely new that no one's ever done
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think it's inspiring to have,
you know, some type of educational
[SPEAKER_10]: background.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what you bring to the table is
scientifically grounded and then launching
[SPEAKER_10]: yourself into this new industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can imagine going into so many
different careers and getting so many
[SPEAKER_10]: different educational experiences,
whether it's in botany or chemistry or
[SPEAKER_10]: business or nowadays.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, geez, just go into the MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more engineering and manufacturing
engineering or, you know, industrial
[SPEAKER_10]: engineering, what I'll call it,
you know, packaging, automated packaging,
[SPEAKER_10]: automated dispensing.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it could be automated, it's coming to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's just so many different areas
where innovation is happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: And imagine what that cannabis show is
going to look like 10 years from now,
[SPEAKER_10]: as opposed to, you know, where it is
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just, it's amazing to think that
we're at the dawn of a new industry that's
[SPEAKER_10]: going to plateau some time out in the
future.
[SPEAKER_10]: But until it plateaus, we're on a steep
learning curve where all kinds of new
[SPEAKER_10]: shit's happening all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that about the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was talking about how it's a
fractal medicine and how it's adaptogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's becoming such a large industry
right now that you can almost be involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in anything and almost have expertise in
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it somehow is going to bring itself
back to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's sort of funny,
you know, like talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you get yourself involved in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that you're involved in the
right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If every single conversation that you have
with the people surrounding you ends up in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can start a nuclear waste and
it ends up in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk about the problems of the
world and it ends up in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is really funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you got, you got, you have to have
a passion.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have a passion, you know,
then you're going to find a way into
[SPEAKER_11]: anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause everything, everything is really
pretty competitive.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think about just all any field is,
and because there's a lot of humans on the
[SPEAKER_11]: earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: But so, and I, I also think that with all
the manufacturing and engineering and all
[SPEAKER_11]: the farmers and farming that's going on,
I think that making products is,
[SPEAKER_11]: is a really huge, you know, area that,
you know, what to do with all this
[SPEAKER_11]: material.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, I think the innovation of
being able to even put it in food,
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand why all the edibles
are, are mostly candy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, I would eat a CBD
sandwich, you know, or CBD soup.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of want like, the full CBD cafe
where the lemonade has CBD in it and every
[SPEAKER_11]: damn thing in there is so, you know,
it's just the full medicinal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds, that sounds like skunk man
Sam's nightmare.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying that I wouldn't want a THC
cafe too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, I can see both sides of the fence.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have a CBD sandwich with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll throw a CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't have to be, we're not,
you know, we're not cannabinoidist.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we want as many cannabinoids in
there as possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: I truly think your vision's going to come
true, but it's not going to be anything
[SPEAKER_10]: weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be CBD will be fortified
into all foods, just like vitamin C is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be fortified from baby cereals to
geriatric formulations and everything in
[SPEAKER_10]: between.
[SPEAKER_10]: All foods will contain CBD 10 years from
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll just be food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like back in 1873.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when, when all of the hemp
was fed to the animals and then the
[SPEAKER_11]: animals were producing, you know,
high CBD eggs and then we were eating the
[SPEAKER_11]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there, there was a, there was an intact
cannabinoid system at one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It went through all the creatures and also
cleaned the land.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, sometimes the,
the, the weed, you know, accumulates the
[SPEAKER_11]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_11]: That means you can't use that that year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'd have to put it back into the
land, but yeah, no, it's.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you think that the possibility
exists since our bodies are prepared to
[SPEAKER_13]: use cannabinoids all the time,
that the very first edibles were probably
[SPEAKER_13]: from the stories I've read in the Bible
about this manna that was available.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was just manna wanna and that
the seeds were being used for the oil and
[SPEAKER_13]: the leaves were the months, the most
nutritious things that were available on
[SPEAKER_13]: earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's how we got this cannabinoid
system in our body.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was from the day one, whenever that
stuff was being dropped.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it's, now we're getting around to
using it as edibles again, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_13]: sure that that's how it started off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to believe, Indra, that it
conferred a evolutionary benefit to any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tribes that might've been using it as
a food, a portable food source,
[SPEAKER_00]: rich in protein, rich in omega threes,
which is brain food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meantime, the neuroprotective as well
as antibacterial and anti-fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: properties that we find in cannabis
probably conferred an evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage to the tribes that figured out
that cannabis might be a benefit to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they were eating it or smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meantime, by carrying the seeds along with
them, they probably dropped them in some
[SPEAKER_00]: places and then saw them grow up the next
year in that new place and maybe learned
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our whole entire system is based off of,
so it shows that evolutionally we have
[SPEAKER_11]: totally grown together to create a system
in our body that works with that plant so
[SPEAKER_11]: much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that there's not a lot of
examples where humans are willing to step
[SPEAKER_11]: up for a plant like we are for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, being humans on the planet,
there's a lot of stress involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that we can get around
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a species that creates stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a species that brings in stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a species that dissects stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a plant that can really help us
with our stressful lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it really has a big play
in our evolution as far as human goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: because as soon as we are able to get rid
of that stress factor, that's the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're able to have a higher intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we're going to be able to
become more biologically intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that the Mayans say that
it's going to be the flower that saves
[SPEAKER_01]: humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I truly believe that, because it's
going to give us different thought
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns, as well as different types of
body patterns that help get rid of both
[SPEAKER_01]: emotional and physical stress.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you believe John Allegro,
it might be mana-wana or mana-cilla-mana.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be like there was some psilocybin
in the bread too, I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm pretty sure that the way that
they found out that everything makes you
[SPEAKER_13]: high was by putting it in their mouth and
trying it out, and then relating that
[SPEAKER_13]: experience to somebody, which is,
again, the teaching, how powerful the
[SPEAKER_13]: teaching is, because it had to extend
beyond those people.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you were talking earlier about
fractals, and I think our nervous systems
[SPEAKER_13]: and our cannabinoid systems are fractals.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we have so many different
things, and we can understand so many
[SPEAKER_13]: different things.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many millions of little
recesses in the mind that we're just
[SPEAKER_13]: learning to explore them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the plant was here for some good
reason.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you can't come up with an
explanation for why it's here.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's here, and it has persisted.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as the god said, God persisted.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we even persisted into almost
legal, not quite yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still being looked at and held up
for examination and so forth.
[SPEAKER_13]: But nonetheless, back when I started using
it, it was completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even passing information out about it was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even in 98, when I posted BHO,
there was a lot of strange energy around
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I know that the authoritarians that
we live with, don't like us exercising the
[SPEAKER_13]: freedom of mind that being on THC gives
you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just unlocks a bunch of doors.
[SPEAKER_13]: You look places that you might not have
looked before, simply because we're prone
[SPEAKER_13]: to being programmed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's what they call TV is
programming.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't watch it, but I know it's a
problem in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: For real, for real, for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell, we've been rocking 9,
10, 11, just a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could probably go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering, from Daniel, how you
liked your new pressure machine that you
[SPEAKER_11]: had got.
[SPEAKER_11]: You had taken some pictures that I've not
too long ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's all that working out?
[SPEAKER_11]: And how's Whistler Tech doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're still waiting to test the
machine.
[SPEAKER_09]: The electricians are supposed to install
it next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have to wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do some dry testing, but we have to
wait for Health Canada approval to use it
[SPEAKER_09]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've been doing the same process just
on smaller vessels that weren't custom
[SPEAKER_09]: designed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Whistler Technology is doing well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just finishing off all the research
phase on all this equipment and getting
[SPEAKER_09]: ready to fully commercialize it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be excited when we can compound and
be able to use the herb with other
[SPEAKER_11]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we feel is the true magic
in healing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've even seen some patents that have
been given to us by family at one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: talks that we did about how to cure
prostate cancer and using the fungi and
[SPEAKER_11]: everything together with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just know that with Chinese medicine
and Ayurvedic medicine, that it would be
[SPEAKER_11]: really wonderful once we can start putting
the whole medicine together, because
[SPEAKER_11]: really, I mean, cannabis is an island
almost in a sense right now in itself,
[SPEAKER_11]: just going through this whole ringer of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, it's all a process.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess we have to be good with the
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much of it is an adaptogenic healer
to ourselves, it's also adaptogenic in its
[SPEAKER_01]: own plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has certain other master plants
that it likes to be blended with,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it likes to be grown next to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're creating it as just an island
that we can't do different botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: compounding with it, then we're really
doing ourselves and also the plant a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: disservice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to be able to do all of these
isolates and all this distillates and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the concentrates that we're doing,
that's all wonderful and well and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of other plants that
really should be compounded with it in its
[SPEAKER_01]: own concentrated value as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, my other venture is Whistler
Therapeutics, and that is about taking the
[SPEAKER_09]: whole production of cannabis for medicinal
purposes and looking at the holistic
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective and that your production of
the plant has to be helping the
[SPEAKER_09]: environment because we're producing
medicine today, but then it's made from
[SPEAKER_09]: oil and the entire production process is
releasing pollutants and there's so much
[SPEAKER_09]: transport so I mean, medicine production
isn't a huge pollution compared to
[SPEAKER_09]: everything else, but as part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you say, cannabis helps change
change people's perspective to realize
[SPEAKER_09]: that they're being damaging to the
environment and also opens them up to more
[SPEAKER_09]: plant healers and other things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mushrooms are pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because in Canada, mushrooms
are like the last unregulated frontier.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no regulations for buying,
picking or selling wild mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which can be hallucinogenic and aren't
controlled like the Amanita mushrooms or
[SPEAKER_09]: incredibly toxic.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're legally allowed to pick death
cap mushrooms and sell them to someone
[SPEAKER_09]: else.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need all this strict regulation on
cannabis to protect the children.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just the market size is so large
that they need that regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that you're right about,
you know, we're going to have a lot more
[SPEAKER_09]: plant partners or fungi partners that are
going to help us out.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are some, a pair of matsutake
mushrooms I found that have this heart in
[SPEAKER_09]: the center and they're permanently bonded
together, which you often don't see with
[SPEAKER_09]: the pine mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was a really interesting find,
but I think, you know, the plants have a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot to teach us about how we can heal
ourselves and heal the planet more.
[SPEAKER_09]: So especially the mushrooms are so good at
bringing the planet back into balance
[SPEAKER_09]: after a disturbance.
[SPEAKER_09]: So humans go out and destroy a forest and
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mushrooms and the other trees work
together to bring that ecosystem back.
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking at how we can integrate our
production of medicines into the natural
[SPEAKER_09]: cycles of the earth is going to bring us
forward and, you know, more in tune with
[SPEAKER_09]: what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which really brings us into the work that
we're doing as far as seeing this as an
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity to let small farms heal the
earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I mean, there is corporate
farming out there and that's a thing and
[SPEAKER_11]: it's whatever, but, you know, it's the
small farms and things that have the
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity to farm regeneratively and to
take care of the land.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're coming up to the Emerald Cup and
there's a lot of really amazing farms
[SPEAKER_11]: that, you know, will be highlighted at the
Emerald Cup through the regenerative farm
[SPEAKER_11]: award.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's other institutes like the
Resource Innovation Institute out of
[SPEAKER_11]: Portland, which analyzes growth with their
electrical output and their water output
[SPEAKER_11]: and has come up with a way to measure,
you know, how efficient they are as a
[SPEAKER_11]: business.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we think that that's really valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that even, you know,
getting down to the very root,
[SPEAKER_01]: the root of it all is that, you know,
we know that we're losing 90% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: species on the planet and that doesn't
disclude fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also means, sure, we're losing 90% of
the large species on the planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're also losing 90% of the very,
very small species on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we start forgetting about what
gives us true intelligence, which is from
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, which is the fungi and the
bacteria, and if we're starting to lose
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that, then it is more important
than ever to bring back the small farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: because the small farms are going to be
able to host this biologically intelligent
[SPEAKER_01]: biome that holds all of these species and
brings in larger amounts of species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like, you know,
creating some kind of a foundation to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect all of these important species
that are on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that this is our
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more that we cultivate this plant
in a natural process is the more that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be able to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys going to the cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we'll be there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have our tea be there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be doing some panels there
and working at the regenerative
[SPEAKER_11]: agriculture lounge and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, if you're going to be there,
it'd be fun to meet and hang out and ATN
[SPEAKER_11]: and anyone else.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Mark's coming down.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to see Wade and, you know,
a lot of these good family members.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're really looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: What about you, Daniel?
[SPEAKER_11]: You coming down?
[SPEAKER_09]: Not this time, but I'm going to be pretty
busy up here for a while, but I'm looking
[SPEAKER_09]: forward to being able to travel around
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to go back to what you were
saying just a minute ago and add in that I
[SPEAKER_09]: think the cannabis from a medical
perspective is bringing, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: somewhat of a democratization of medicine
rather than having these pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_09]: companies that have to be, you know,
clinical trials are really good and
[SPEAKER_09]: powerful, but everybody's put in the same
box and everything has to be such a large
[SPEAKER_09]: production that rather than finding
different medicines that work well for
[SPEAKER_09]: small populations, we're going to find
whatever one works best for.
[SPEAKER_09]: The average and when you have small farm
cannabis production on the medical side,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, you're just servicing the community
and who's going to be able to better
[SPEAKER_09]: provide the medicines that that community
needs and someone who's right there and
[SPEAKER_09]: can talk to those patients and know what
the problems are there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then you don't have all the transport
and all that waste that we have with these
[SPEAKER_09]: large systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what you're seeing with medical
marijuana, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have these local dispensaries in
production.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the really large companies
are, you know, I don't hope that's going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be the main way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that small scale local production,
whereas you say we spread the knowledge to
[SPEAKER_09]: everyone else and they can do it within
their own community and service their own
[SPEAKER_09]: needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need massive mega producers per
se that are going to supply everybody with
[SPEAKER_09]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then everything's made according to
the economics of where it's being
[SPEAKER_09]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the technology we're developing
can be applied anywhere in the world,
[SPEAKER_09]: really.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's simple and it's environmentally
friendly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can set up for not very much
money, a pretty robust medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: system anywhere people need it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really what brought this whole
thing to legalization to begin with was
[SPEAKER_11]: the medicinal aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're in Canada, John Conroy is a
cannabis lawyer in Vancouver who really is
[SPEAKER_11]: one of our main people that's helping us
keep our medical abilities in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we really support him and that whole
group in every way.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also wonder about, Mark,
if you know anything about just the
[SPEAKER_11]: exploration of endophytic fungi within the
plant and how they play a role with
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine and how that's not really
something you hear a lot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be able to, for the very first
time, because we're federally legal in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, we'll be able to actually have the
ability for people that have scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses to be able to study soil-grown,
fungi-inspired, bacterial-grown cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering, yeah, Mark,
what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that we're going to be able
to step a little bit further into
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding the plant and its uptake
through its natural cycles?
[SPEAKER_10]: Bong-Rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean me, Mark, or him, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Marcus, your Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: And welcome, D420K.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Bong-Rip, it's nice to jump on and do
a Bong-Rip with the panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to remind Darren what the
other part of it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ye Tien, Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I see Indra?
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I see Indra in there, too?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Indra, how you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_12]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: All you guys and your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even when I'm not on here, I watch it and
just throw the odd Bong-Rip in the
[SPEAKER_12]: comments.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all do one.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the... I've got this new show
called Cherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody know about it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything behind it or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard it's an OG cross with a... It's
called Pie Breath, what I have now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an OG cross with a cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody know the lineage on any of
that sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like the cherry pie thing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've definitely grown it and done a bunch
of different blends of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard that it's an OG cross for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wondering if that breath is either a
Mendo breath or a hogs breath in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is always really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a thug pug.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I know about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and met Terp Crusher from Instagram
and he had all these thug pug cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently the guy has some good
abilities of selecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a lot of the different varieties and
it was...
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's got some kind of an
original Durban poison in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure, but love to hear
about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm squishing some, you know, some
personal rosin out of it and that sort of
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's tasty, very tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it a lot and I'm glad I got to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did it from seed.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had it going for about a year now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in about the fourth or fifth stage
of budding it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: Real nice and everything and seeing what
its true potential is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So cherry pie breath.
[SPEAKER_12]: Long written mother lovers, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We grew a grateful breath cherry puff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was from the Mendo breath two,
which is a gauge green strain,
[SPEAKER_11]: but we got it through Mr. Spliff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it's got an amazing flavor and
it's a blue style.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plant bluish dark plant with like a super
silvery trichome on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has a really fuelish kind of
humaline, turpentine kind of flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the kind of diesel dog flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's really, really awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great Yielder too.
[SPEAKER_12]: How about pre-Soviet headstache,
pre-Soviet Petrolia headstache cross
[SPEAKER_12]: Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got these seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I started two of them off just to see what
they do.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're supposed to be like a 80 90 day
finisher.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, uh, does anybody know anything about
that one?
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you ever heard of it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the name of it, I'm just like,
come on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, my, my dog, my little dog
is a Russian Svetnayan Belonkin Shih Tzu.
[SPEAKER_12]: I never believed the lady that I bought it
off of.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was actually her heritage until I
wanted to breed her.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to find a mate for her and all I
could find was these big large 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_12]: pound Shih Tzu.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's an eight pound little dog.
[SPEAKER_12]: She is an actual Russian Svetnayan
Belonkin Shih Tzu.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got the whole name, which is weird,
but this Russian pre-Soviet Petrolia
[SPEAKER_12]: headstache cross Kandahar is what this is
called.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got it from a guy that really,
I got it from the same guy I got the
[SPEAKER_12]: cherry, the pie breath from.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really, really curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre-Soviet, that means 79.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's old.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they popped up really nice and
quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it tall?
[SPEAKER_12]: Did it pop up tall?
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds could have been made new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that the pre-Soviet,
that 79 is when they went into
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll keep you all up to date on it
anyways and show you what it does.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Soviet thing, I mean, that's so large.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's the, the genetics,
the auto flowering, ruderalis genetics
[SPEAKER_11]: come from Siberia, you know, and then
there's also like CBD, hempish cultivars
[SPEAKER_11]: from Uzbekistan and over in the other,
you know, East, you know, Western parts of
[SPEAKER_11]: Russia.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, when you say pre-Soviet,
it'd be really hard to know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would for some reason think it might be
taller, but.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, they're about this tall
right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just little babies.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's this little.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they widely?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're Afghan and they're
pre-Soviet before 1979.
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed on the pie breath, it wants to
get in veg.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wants to be in bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got the little the little balls,
not the balls, the little pods,
[SPEAKER_12]: the seed, not the seed stuff, but we're,
you know, the little, little bud
[SPEAKER_12]: correlation there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They build up.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, it always wants to be in bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even in veg.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got the little calic hairs on it and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it has some root.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it has some of that ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just means roadside, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it means a wilder road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, but the reason people like
ruderalis is because there's a lot of them
[SPEAKER_02]: from the far north, which are auto and
some of them, uh, north or auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We liked it up here in the, in the north
and BC because of our summers are shorter,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, they just seemed as soon as it
started to get root bound, they just bud
[SPEAKER_12]: right off.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they did that in July.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometime they finished off in September.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our age determined it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they start flowering or making a
certain age.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_11]: We grew a lot of those in our outdoor
genetics in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the day, you'd get throwbacks of
the ruderalis and they were definitely
[SPEAKER_11]: better for hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say a lot of times they made like
a really kind of a full free.
[SPEAKER_11]: Top, you know, where it was like a lion's
mane or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, who knows what, you know,
what else you could say, but it was
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely not like a, a bud in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we found within ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it specific in any type of cannabinoid
that you know of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, should we be breeding, you know,
and working with it all to bring in a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has more CBD, CBC, maybe some THCV or
things like that, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even particularly high in any
of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, a variety, the tap way auto
is a Pinola, which is grown in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the largest seed producing
variety growing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Pinola, it will start flowering,
uh, pretty much even under long,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, long photo period, you know,
early in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, uh, it finishes flowering though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a lot would start flowering and
they never really finish flowering unless
[SPEAKER_02]: they're forced to like colder the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, photo period doesn't make
them stop flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to mention maybe just because I
will forget otherwise, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friend James just reminded me that,
uh, they have, um, a new, their first
[SPEAKER_04]: episode is coming out, um, highlighting
the CPS work by Solod Outreach in
[SPEAKER_04]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine, Jack Phillips is a big
part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, uh, helping run it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all about giving cannabis to,
uh, to people who are opioid dependent and
[SPEAKER_04]: people who are out on the streets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give away many, many, many hundreds
of packages every month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, his episodes coming out on their,
um, website, which is move themovement
[SPEAKER_04]: .org.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, uh, they got a cool film
crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a teaser for this series and,
uh, they did it at Salome's event actually
[SPEAKER_04]: that you guys had the booth at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if you guys got interviewed by
those guys, but we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get together with them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really excellent movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, great group of guys doing a
really important thing, gathering a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome individuals and stories from the
cannabis culture and beyond really move
[SPEAKER_01]: the movement, something that's going to be
an important part of this culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Daryl Daryl is a big, big part of that as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's doing good work and who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might do more with him in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Move themovement.org.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't mean to hijack the conversation,
but I knew I would forget as a probably
[SPEAKER_04]: going to wrap it up here in the next
little bit, half hour maximum.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how the conversation goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're probably going to hit the high
road.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're here in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go visit evolved extracts
right now and check in with Marley.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome person, beautiful company.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, and some other conscious farms in
town here, Kana Essentials and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, big love to everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be going to Southern Oregon
soon and Northern California, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: to be checking in with everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks everyone on the panel here for
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Caladrius Network, Wade, Mark,
Indra, Skunk, ATN, D40.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention one more time
people in California who have the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to donate a CBD flower to Caladrius
Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have until January 1st or December
31st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really important that we're able to get
children the medicine that they need and
[SPEAKER_01]: the families to be able to sleep well at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, health and harmony is what
this plant is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, farmers who have excess
flour, please donate it to Caladrius
[SPEAKER_01]: Network.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have, uh, five gallons of CO2 CBD
extract from my hemp plant and it came
[SPEAKER_13]: with, uh, all the labs on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's 0.01% or 0.03 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: THC and the rest of it is, uh,
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've extracted some out of that
because as you know, you've got to
[SPEAKER_13]: winterize it after CO2 extraction,
which is a huge joke.
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, I winterized a bunch of it and
it's a very good stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's red as red can be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I haven't distilled it because
nothing I hate worse than applying heat to
[SPEAKER_13]: something to purify it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you can get a skeleton out of a
cow too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's purification of sorts too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't eat cows.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't, I'm not one to comment on
that, but, uh, uh, I do have that CBD for
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wade, you guys kept threatening to come
around and pick it up and it's in my
[SPEAKER_13]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Soaking in pure ethanol to under proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be in touch, Indra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, when you guys get down to Northern
California, uh, ring me up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I live in Redway.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming right on through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing our dragon fly earth medicine,
2018 love tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming to visit everybody and give
hugs and share flower and share fun times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd love to come by and see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, um, I got a 45 acre spa.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the Matto River runs along the edge of
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Matto Indian tribe is across the river
and on Friday and Saturday nights when
[SPEAKER_13]: it's not too cold or inclement,
they chant and drum, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_13]: cosmic and sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: 300 foot tall trees all around the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this land was never logged because it
was too close to the Indian reservation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they left it alone and right out the
front door.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got 369 foot tall Redwood and it's
very commanding and it's a very quiet
[SPEAKER_13]: spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the nearest neighbor, I suppose if
you had to throw a hammer over there,
[SPEAKER_13]: if you were really strong, but they're
about a thousand feet away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise it's quiet.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, uh, sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on the Sunday before Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be at up at Alpenglo farms
at Craig's house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, ladies sativa and the whole
Humboldt high five family and lots of
[SPEAKER_11]: people there in Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll, yeah, we'll get your number
through Marcus and get in touch and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you a call, let you know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You might find it a peaceful spot to
visit.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, I bet it sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just for the trees and the,
and the river and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I love nothing more than those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we love Redway.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love Redway.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's quiet.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I, I appreciate, um,
being here because it's a real gift to be
[SPEAKER_13]: able to be here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And plus I live alone on this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: My son's lived down in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm always open to visitors because
it's just me, the Chihuahua and Ruby,
[SPEAKER_13]: my parent who just laid three eggs on my
pillow a couple of nights ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to, it looks like I'm going
to have some other parents, but,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, yeah, it's quiet and nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And plus I've got some, some this right
here, uh, rosin, I've got 40 grams of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is, it's this tangerine sour diesel
cross of sorts.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were just smoking on some sour tangy
that was grown here.
[SPEAKER_11]: In town.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that you show us that we're for
sure coming now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big smoke session.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm down to one piece of glass because,
um, like Sam, you know, the road to doing
[SPEAKER_13]: dabs is covered in broken glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: So make sure you bring along a dabbing
pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's why it's important to just
buy like a five or a $10,000 pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Careful with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you take good care to not break it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get one of those from a little Bobby
Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always helps when you're, when you're
going to be traveling with a Snodgrass
[SPEAKER_01]: clan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be coming with glass in tow for
sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: For real.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Snodgrass family is coming to the
Emerald Cup too this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I, I do, uh, somebody broke my
last one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a Snoddy in my collection badly.
[SPEAKER_13]: A fantastic pipe.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I keep it wrapped up and put away
because the last time I had it out with me
[SPEAKER_13]: with it, they literally dropped it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it wasn't for my superior hand-eye
coordination that had caught it,
[SPEAKER_13]: it would have been trashed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't bring it out anymore except for
Malone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that I'm not going to break it
or at least I'm relatively sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this year, this year there's the Bob
Snodgrass award.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Emerald Cup is in still doing a Bob
Snodgrass award.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be there at the very
front of the hall of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be going down with us and
hanging out in the teepee and ATN will be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in touch with you for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got that covered.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, um, Carolyn Garcia's speaking
this year and stuff is she's super excited
[SPEAKER_11]: and yeah, we're just really excited to
link up with the family and have a good
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grateful dead families, you know,
hanging, hanging tough there still.
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be a really good cover.
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, if you guys ever saw the
Grateful Dead skull with the dreadlocks on
[SPEAKER_13]: it, my wife Annie drew that for them in
their kitchen on the piece of a Grateful
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead stationary on the back, way back when
in the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you'll have to share that story with
Carolyn when you meet her, when you see
[SPEAKER_11]: her at the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hoping that she'll come from the show
last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: She had a triple embolism in her brain and
she woke up surviving and in good feelings
[SPEAKER_13]: and stuff, but she woke up in 1998 and she
doesn't remember anything from 1998
[SPEAKER_13]: forward till now, which is pretty much our
whole relationship.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if she'll come.
[SPEAKER_13]: I keep trying to talk her into it,
but she's very hesitant.
[SPEAKER_13]: She sort of treats me like an insurance
salesman on the second call these days
[SPEAKER_13]: when I talk to her because she just
doesn't remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can't fault her for it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't push her.
[SPEAKER_13]: All I can do is just give her support and
that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe she'll show up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be a great blessing if that
happened because I'm going to have on a
[SPEAKER_13]: trailer there a unit that you can pull
into the field, harvest and extract in
[SPEAKER_13]: real time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for me, it's like a big achievement
and I would love her to be there and see
[SPEAKER_13]: it, but she doesn't really remember me.
[SPEAKER_13]: So not much I'm going to be able to do
about that except for go forward from
[SPEAKER_13]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I'm going to call it a day
here after hanging out for two and a half
[SPEAKER_04]: hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all you wonderful people and just
enjoying a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while since we had church.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was definitely, you know, into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that we talked a little bit about
hemp today and we'll see where that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going in the next couple of years here in
North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just keep on keeping on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do wish I could be at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to all of your social media
posts and whatnot of all the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: will be there, all the little videos and
all the little photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys have a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuban, enjoy puffing on that hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wish I could be there puffing it with you,
but alas, brother, we'll have to do it in
[SPEAKER_04]: another country sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone else, Daniel, D420K, Etienne,
Skunkman Sam, Indra, Dr. Mark Sheldon and
[SPEAKER_04]: Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll see you guys in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
