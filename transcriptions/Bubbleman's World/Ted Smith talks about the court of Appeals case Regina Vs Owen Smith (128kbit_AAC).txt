[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta give me a quick blurb from my
YouTube channel on the case today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick blurb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a pretty tough day in court
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tell them what we were there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, we were in court today with a
former employee of mine, Owen Smith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was charged with trafficking THC,
or possession for the purpose,
[SPEAKER_01]: after having been caught making cookies in
a bakery for a dispensary that I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: own, the Cannabis Buyers Club in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year and a half ago, Supreme Court
Justice Johnson ruled that the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana access regulations were
unconstitutional because they didn't allow
[SPEAKER_01]: patients to make derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies, tea, hash, oil, any extract of
cannabis is technically illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only allowed dry cannabis to grow
and use as medicine according to the
[SPEAKER_01]: strict interpretation of the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge, again, struck that down a year
and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The court, or sorry, the Department of
Justice appealed that decision,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is where we were today in front of
three judges at the Court of Appeal of
[SPEAKER_01]: British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appealing the decision that would allow us
to possess cannabis resin and extracts as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to just dried marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Crown appealed that decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Crown's wish, the Health Canada and
the Department of Justice, is to
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially have exceptions made for
cannabis and marijuana, but cannabis resin
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of the other derivatives in the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: in their thinking, should remain illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a frustrating day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the Crown's positions don't seem
very reasonable, but the judges,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, seemed to be in agreement
with the Crown before the day even
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did read the material beforehand,
so they're going to come in with an
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion, but they really did seem really
opposed to granting an acquittal to Owen
[SPEAKER_01]: or allowing him to just walk free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really bugged them that the
Cannabis Buyers Club, they don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of the Cannabis Buyers Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they read in the court decision is
that we're an unincorporated,
[SPEAKER_01]: non-taxpaying, non-compliant organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't comply with a single law,
not tax laws, not the Health and Safety
[SPEAKER_01]: Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the judges really struggled with
just letting us go as an organization
[SPEAKER_01]: because patients have a constitutional
right to this medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Kirk was able to convince them
otherwise, but it's tough to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the judges really didn't seem
very favorable to us, but by the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, I think Kirk had made some points
that they might not have considered
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought so as well, that he made some
decent points and at least educated them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bit of a wait now before we're
going to hear any... Yeah, the wait's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to kill us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not kill us, but it's going to be
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's likely four to six months,
but it could be 11, 10 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said earlier, you could have a baby
in less than a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the big fight, Ted, and I certainly
thank you guys for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to stand on the front line with
you guys as well because this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important decision for a lot of people in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very important matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we've done a good enough job that
we've changed things, so we'll see how it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
