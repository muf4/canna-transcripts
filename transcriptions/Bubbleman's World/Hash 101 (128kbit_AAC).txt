[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
and welcome to Hashish 101 with Bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today to do a little bit of a new
show in Bubble Man's World and what I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of wanted to talk to you guys about today
was the difference between drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: drying curing your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the assumption that most of you
have tried the bags, have had your go at
[SPEAKER_00]: making water hash and you've ended up with
an end product whether you've chopped it
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a razor blade or pushed it through
a strainer or microplanned it and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you dried it on a plate or you dried it on
wood or you dried it on parchment or
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard or all these other different
options and some things worked and some
[SPEAKER_00]: things didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really going to go over all the
best ways to get to the point that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start right at the point of
drying and curing and it's a two-part
[SPEAKER_00]: system because when we're dealing with
water hash obviously the gland heads
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly fresh frozen which I have a
little fresh frozen here right today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Astro Boy that I ran with
Johnny B on Puff Wednesdays just last week
[SPEAKER_00]: so why don't we right off the bat start
out with a nice little rip of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the newest hash that I have so
it's really really flavorful the way fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh fresh material is really really
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not to say that I couldn't cure
this material and maintain a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor in it but it is very fresh it
hasn't you know this is literally like
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days old this is closer to seven
years so I have all the different gametes
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about the
difference in them how they were cured how
[SPEAKER_00]: they were dried and of course the
difference on my the difference on my
[SPEAKER_00]: palate when I hit them in a D nail or if
someone were to smoke them in a joint or
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke them in a vaporizer a different
variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take that rip of the fresh frozen
this is 73 micron fresh frozen Astro Boy
[SPEAKER_00]: great flavor on that Astro Boy to a known
to a well I don't want to say well diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: but to an experienced hash smoker
particularly a full melt hash smoker dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift and wet wash because I don't believe
that you can get this same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: olfactory or taste or smell when all
you're doing is hitting wet wash but when
[SPEAKER_00]: you have that foundation of dry sift you
know what resin is supposed to taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: without the water present so when you hit
the same resin and it has the water
[SPEAKER_00]: present it becomes you become aware of it
so one of the things you'll notice when
[SPEAKER_00]: water is present tiniest little bit of
water which this still has a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bit left in it it'll be a little bit sharp
on your throat and that's from the heat of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water heating up and just not being
smooth like the resin but but just heating
[SPEAKER_00]: up and so that is part of drying to get
rid of that sharp sharp feeling on your
[SPEAKER_00]: throat you want to dry the resin and
because it was fresh frozen you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine the wax membrane on the trichome
head that holds all the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles inside that head is wet the wax
is moist it has moisture in it while it's
[SPEAKER_00]: living and if you take it from the living
hash right into washing it the head never
[SPEAKER_00]: actually gets dried and therefore it holds
the moisture from the water process just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more readily than it would had you
say dried that material for a month or two
[SPEAKER_00]: now I know that might sound extreme to a
lot but if you think of third world hash
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying countries countries that have
been supplying the majority of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's hash for the last 30 40 50 years
they're doing just that so okay so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: see what else we're gonna hit here we are
going to hit well let's hit the dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: we just hit the wet wash the dry sift has
a quite a beautiful color to it you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see it's a powder yet when I flip the card
upside down it doesn't fall off it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: very well isolated gland heads and this of
course we know that it's dry we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to have any sharp feelings
in regards to moisture because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: never exposed to water
[SPEAKER_00]: great taste on that super floral can't
even tell you I'm not I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what strain this particular hash
was I think it was one of my friends hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the taste is so florally and
bouquet and the fact of the matter is the
[SPEAKER_00]: astro boy is a tastier strain and even in
fresh frozen bubble hash it still doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: come across the palate the way that bone
dry florally plant matter that has all of
[SPEAKER_00]: its water soluble terpenes into that's
going to be the major difference with the
[SPEAKER_00]: water in the dry the water soluble
terpenes are going to be lost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: washing and of course you know the strains
that have majorly mostly alcohol soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes these strains will maintain their
flavor and people will wonder what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what do you mean your
resident doesn't have a good flavor after
[SPEAKER_00]: you make water hash mine smells just like
the bag that's alcohol soluble terpenes so
[SPEAKER_00]: it melted not quite as much as the fresh
frozen this particular sift is about four
[SPEAKER_00]: months old it's been wood curing in my
bubble box on a card open face not sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bubble box isn't hermetically
sealed it's just wood much like a humidor
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been settling in here and curing
for the last six months and I'd say with
[SPEAKER_00]: the with the dry sift what I notice mostly
when I cure dry sift is that it really
[SPEAKER_00]: brings out rich overtones of the earthy
herb flavored tastes so that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say about that next up we're going
to go to some more cured Astro Boy bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash this Astro Boy is from I guess May so
we got May June July August September
[SPEAKER_00]: October I guess we're six months because
we're not in October yet so five months
[SPEAKER_00]: this is five months cured and it's been
curing in an oil slick it has been curing
[SPEAKER_00]: in an oil slick for its entire life cycle
so let's give that a shot and see how that
[SPEAKER_00]: one goes
[SPEAKER_00]: all right so there's that beautiful Astro
Boy flavor and when you remove that tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of moisture that little bit of
water that's not only making it sharp you
[SPEAKER_00]: also remove some of the flavor masking and
the flavor is unveiled now I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand exactly what's going on and how
the water is masking that flavor but it
[SPEAKER_00]: does the hash still melted beautifully I
believe that was a 73 micron so it's 73 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 73 the test was accurate two separate
plants that I grew but definitely both
[SPEAKER_00]: still Astro Boy and yeah so we get back to
the drying versus the curing the drying is
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the wax membrane on the on the
glandular trichome to dry fully before you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually start aging the hash like what we
have here this is all six and a half year
[SPEAKER_00]: old master Kush I've shown it on the
channel before extremely stable almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: hard as a rock yet it's very bendable I
can separate these two out easily enough
[SPEAKER_00]: put them back on an oil slick check this
out just snap that like a shatter and when
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them both on the oil slick they'll
melt back together so we're definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take a hit of this this is the
master Kush and one of the amazing things
[SPEAKER_00]: about this master Kush which is truly
almost seven years old in the cure now is
[SPEAKER_00]: how much the terpenes have changed and I
usually say degraded as the age of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes oxidization and the exposure to
light all changes the terpenes they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very volatile even at room temperature
they evaporate they lose flavor they
[SPEAKER_00]: change this master Kush which was six and
a half years cured I had it cured probably
[SPEAKER_00]: for two and a half to almost three years
it was in glass it spent two years in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble box in wood and then it's probably
spent another close to a year plus now
[SPEAKER_00]: outside on an oil slick just exposed
because the outside is now so hard and out
[SPEAKER_00]: of all my hashes the taste on this one is
probably the best extremely flavorful very
[SPEAKER_00]: deep and earthy deep aftertaste satiates
the throat and gets in really deep and
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles and melts into a into a beautiful
liquid reddish liquid so
[SPEAKER_00]: this one reminds me almost of a perfume in
the aftertaste and as I'm talking as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking and exhaling slowly you can feel
the strong presence of those terpenes I
[SPEAKER_00]: wish I could get this stuff tested before
and after because whatever degradation has
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred in the terpene it is powerfully
aromatic spicy perfumy it's just a really
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful taste that I can say none of my
other hashes have taken on that taste and
[SPEAKER_00]: initially when it first started changing
into that taste which was around year four
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly thought it had been
contaminated and I was really worried and
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched everything around and I was
wondering if some sort of thing dumped
[SPEAKER_00]: into it or it got affected and over the
years as it changed more and more into
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste I realized it was just a
natural terpene degradation so now
[SPEAKER_00]: remember one thing to add while I'm
talking about this stuff is that it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important to dry the hash first if you
haven't wet washed it if you if you fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen in particular and you already have
that wet membrane and now you've moistened
[SPEAKER_00]: it even more with the washing process
please do everything you can to join our
[SPEAKER_00]: group on Facebook which is water
extraction drying technique I'll put the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in the comments of this video join
that group learn how to properly break up
[SPEAKER_00]: your bubble and dry it properly so that
when you get to this point you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: can play safely because when you start
sealing up water hashes in plastic or
[SPEAKER_00]: glass or wood or whatever you look you are
looking to seal it up in if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture present that moisture will
degrade the wax membranes it will eat up
[SPEAKER_00]: at your oils and it will you know
potentially mold your hash which is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely non medicinal in fact anti
health in every aspect that I know so
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the differences between drying
and curing and have fun with it if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of bubble and you're one of
those guys that's making a lot I would
[SPEAKER_00]: urge you to take 10 grams or 5 grams of
this kind and that kind and you know split
[SPEAKER_00]: them up so you have 10 10 and 10 you know
you grab 30 grams and you put 10 grams in
[SPEAKER_00]: glass and you put another 10 grams in wood
and you put 10 grams in a high density
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic or a platinum grade silicone like
oil slick and you cure out your hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't let anyone tell you what they
think is better or worse and you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from your own bioassay and it's amazing to
sit in front of a little box of hash like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and say oh this dry sift is a year
that dry sift is three years there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven-year-old hash and a six and a half
year old bubble hash and I guess we should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably hit this seven-year-old guy too
this is a long this this could even almost
[SPEAKER_00]: be eight years old this one because I lose
track of it and I'm not really hung up on
[SPEAKER_00]: how old it's getting I'm more like just
very interested in the flavor profiles how
[SPEAKER_00]: they change and how the terpenes that
clearly modulate those cannabinoids THC's
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD's and CBN's and all these
wonderful things still modulate it once
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes change but obviously it
modulates it when you're affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: modulators obviously you're going to
affect those medicinal compounds and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they interact with someone's
endocannabinoid system I think they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: a real value in the future to have cured
medicine not just for the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: user but for the cannabis user who's using
medicinal cannabis that needs a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of CBN or CBD and that
requires long-term storage here we go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seven plus year so
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a skunk 100 and that was grown by
a master grower amazing guy if you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: saw me in the zip line over top of the
grow he grew this resin and I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: him in a long long time and this is the
last of his resin that I have on tap and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep that for a long time
it'll make 10 years no problem I suspect
[SPEAKER_00]: this seven and six and a half year will
also make 10 to 15 years and then I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven year old another Kush mixture and I
have half of it is in glass and half of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is in a thick strong plastic and they both
are in the wood and they both now have no
[SPEAKER_00]: lids for the last I'd say about a year I
don't really keep a super journal on all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff I have a pretty good memory but
you know if you're if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good memory then mark down the dates that
you're storing your hash and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting your cure how long it took you to
dry it's really nice information to know
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just a really nice way to enjoy
your cannabis when you've got different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of it cured for different different
timelines anyway thank you guys for
[SPEAKER_00]: watching I'm gonna finish it off with a
slideshow of all these wonderful hashes
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown and I'll let you know which one
is which and of course thank you guys so
[SPEAKER_00]: much for watching bubble man's world
please subscribe if you haven't already
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know share the videos it helps if
we can get the word out on the education
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks guys peace
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the herbs for more than one reason I
use the herbs to want whatever season I
[SPEAKER_01]: use the herbs for medicinal purpose I use
the herbs to maintain my focus
[SPEAKER_01]: we got many different kind of herbs
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stealing us absolutely doctor you
