[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome everybody to Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here today just for a short little
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the M1 all turned on and up,
and I'm gonna press a little rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't pressed a little rosin for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured I would share a little video of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got about 19 to 20 grams of some,
I guess I would call it between a three
[SPEAKER_00]: and a four star.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a melt to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Linsey O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should squish rather well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower's well known, and he generally
produces a lovely variety of resin heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, he does mix a lot of his hash,
so this hash isn't one micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably gonna be 45 all the way up
to 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, if you look close enough,
you can usually see that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: variety in there, but I'm not too sure if
you guys can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a feeling like that we should
maybe press it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we weigh it out on the scale here
real quick and get it pressed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, grabbed a business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I find this just the easiest way
when loading the resin into your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a simple thing like that gives you
the ability to to pouch up to kind of dig
[SPEAKER_00]: right in and drop it right down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we're gonna get a good I don't
know, maybe 10 grams of this pressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest amount I've ever pressed,
a bubble for those interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: was a 40 gram chunk that I did some time
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think D420K might have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to remember exactly,
but it was a big press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did it in the original D-nail
press as well and got a decent return.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with these presses, I hear
people constantly saying, oh, get this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, get this one, get that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get one that you feel is,
you know, for me, it's a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the customer service that I get
from the Sasquatch people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of where I'm gonna put
my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the fact that the unit is really
well made and works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I constantly hear from people who tell
me, oh, you know, you should get this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should get this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask them, well, what does it do
that's better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting a bigger extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it preserving the flavors and the
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it doing it faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those three things, let's be
honest, would be the only three things
[SPEAKER_00]: that could potentially, wow, that is one
smidge under 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna do a 10 grammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that little bit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, 10.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got 10.0 on the screen
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally what we'll do now is we'll
figure out getting the hash into all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't wanna let those corners in any
way, shape or form get, have hollow little
[SPEAKER_00]: holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them to be full, full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a little bit of a pre-press is
never a bad idea at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, okey-dokey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got my little packet here made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little bit of air in the corner there
that I could probably do a little better
[SPEAKER_00]: with, but here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty excited about this little squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got everything pretty much set up on
the unit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna have this put up here and this
put down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a serious squish going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the hand pump, which is the SPX
power team right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how effective it is as it's
lowering her down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess what I'd like to do as
well is maybe just push that in a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I got the temperature turned
up a little bit, 220.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do a 180, a 190, a 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fairly warm for hash, but we're
gonna get a full, full extraction from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, why don't we... So
you know that first little sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-press, you can kind of see the oil
starting to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually gonna put you guys into a
better position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bubbling up a storm here,
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash feels completely empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even tell you what this bag feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like there's just nothing left in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've got a nice return here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, we've got a beautiful squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always happy to squish hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the way it just squishes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the warmest I've squished in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see what kind of
flavor profile we get off of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what we need to do now is grab
a dabber and start collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to be sitting back,
so there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we got right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put it on the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any takers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got four grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four grams out of the first press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt there's much left, but for the
sake of testing, why don't we just take
[SPEAKER_00]: this little guy and flip him upside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little bit of shtick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll just give it another little
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some oil coming out right
away, which is always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to squeeze out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we're going to get that gram
plus that's going to bump us over the 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to do a second run for this
very reason alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you're going to get
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep them separate, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first and my second press always get
kept separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's coming out the sides of the press
as well, so it's a good press.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, a quick short press for
that one, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what have we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it wasn't empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it wasn't empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy sht, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real nice press right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, let's collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got another little rock
of rosin from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shall throw that on the scale and
see what kind of return we're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling pretty good that we're well
above 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the lovely color, too,
when you get it thin enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's darker when it gets into one chunk,
but it's dark hash as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got 1.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first one, 3.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 55% return.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all she wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I could put this in a little...
Let me get this disc up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your color right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to put that bad boy in the freezer
and get it sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we managed to get that
Linsey OG disc pressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that amber, hashy kind of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously been heated up a little bit
more, but man, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps are on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: No burnt popcorn smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible how warm you can actually
press some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, when I do a first press and
I've got a lot of something, I'll press it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty hot, like a 210, 220, and that will
let me know exactly what my yield is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's actually there to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, I can go back down and decide,
okay, right now we're going to do a press
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, and we're going to press at 205.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep going down to 195 to 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have all the different varieties of
hash, truly only then will I be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide which one I prefer for that
particular cultivar, because believe it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, there are some cultivars that are so
terpene rich that at excess heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just changes it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It activates a little bit of the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps some of it non-active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it just produces another
wonderful thing for our quiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're out there trying to lock
yourself into a one or another mentality,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that it's a quiver, and you can
do as many different options as you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our second chunk of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another little batch here to press.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a seven gram or so chunk,
and it's pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pressing it in my fingers here
to get it going, and I think we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to just have to wait for this timer,
so once the timer's done, we'll go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I figured while we were waiting,
I could hit a little bit of this second,
[SPEAKER_00]: give you an idea what this is all about,
this Lindsay OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's focusing on the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check out this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see as we get it into strings,
it's a much nicer color, almost that
[SPEAKER_00]: really golden, you know, trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have seen this
with rosin, but it does this really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it on the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it on the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it on the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my dabble on the lens, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that dab on the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, listen, the temperature is almost
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure it's about that time for us to
take a little rip in the bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will put this in here and get you guys
a little bit of a better view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that better?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pachi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty close to the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we don't get any push out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wanting to push it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to maintain now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we don't blow out, we'll be
laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the worry of a blowout is
putting the pouch too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens is it gets pinched
between the edges of the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always a good idea to be careful and
wary of that as you're applying more
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great color on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seven gram press, so it's going to be
a little bit less than last time,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my fat head out of the way and maybe
we'll get a nice view of this press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out all around, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the minute and 30 second point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is substantially cooler, 15 degrees
cooler than the last press.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a little bit of it in the
color, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That swirly beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear domes just bubbling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, so you can see there,
a nice fat press.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of a rosin hair there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, nice fat press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pick it up and see what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, picked up quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rosin weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty sweet rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, just under 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the first press, what happens when we
take it and we press it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: It should squeeze nice for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, she's flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a matter of looking away for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing around with a nice gold cube of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn near pushed that up against the
screen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I gotta have a dab of this
one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just looks absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just do a little dab of that one,
shall we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that feels a little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting another little bit off
of our second press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite as much as we got off that
second press of the first batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely worth collecting
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got, geez, must've gotten like five and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, six, seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: About nine grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pressed out about maybe 17 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my friend's gonna be pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thanks for watching everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin on.
We'll see you next time.
