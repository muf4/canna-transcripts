[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question in regards to that,
Sam, in regards to when did you guys come
[SPEAKER_01]: across terpenes as a modulator to the
cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, about 2000, Rob and I, well,
I obtained some pure THC, 100% pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we vaporized 25% of
the pure THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we vaporized 25 milligrams each in a
volcano on one of those little,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like a little stainless steel
Brillo pad, those little pads that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we were blown away because,
I mean, if you smoke 25 milligrams of hash
[SPEAKER_00]: or 25 milligrams of, you get stoned and
it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this, the most describable thing
about it was that it had no individuality
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever, like cannabis products do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really flat, one dimensional,
kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, I think at the time, actually said,
if this is all there is to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be a smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if this is what you got turned onto
in high school or whatever, instead of the
[SPEAKER_02]: real thing, I don't think any of us would
have really been interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like being a fan of
Everclear, you know, the 180 something
[SPEAKER_02]: proof liquor you can get in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even legal in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's ethanol, essentially,
and nobody drinks it straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, nobody just dilutes it
with water and drinks it because they like
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a novelty.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had no color at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So later that day, what we did was we
mixed it with a little bit of 50% dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allowed was to create a
material that was 70% or 5% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: so less than 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also terpene rich from the
resin, from the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we smoked that, the effects were
twice as strong as the pure THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a light went in our heads because from
the early 70s, both Robert and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: even before we met, had felt that terpenes
might well contribute to the synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the primary reasons was
because haze, when it was tested for its
[SPEAKER_00]: THC level, was to be, you know,
in the high end of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you smoked it, it was in the
outer space of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was really, really active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was because of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how you felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other amazing thing in the early
70s was that people started growing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they started growing senesemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you really noticed what
the difference was between fresh homegrown
[SPEAKER_02]: and what imported weed of whatever kind
you ever got before, what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, that was a profound
difference, you know, just to see
[SPEAKER_02]: something fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The essence of most of the weed that you
smoked back in the 70s, a moldy musty
[SPEAKER_01]: essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I remember my first bag
of weed, 1974, it was moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I think about it, it certainly
was moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of what Robert and I got,
even though it was imported, it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it was, it was very, very,
very, very slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: A general statement that most of the
commercial weed at the time, essentially,
[SPEAKER_01]: which came from Mexico, was probably
fouled with mold and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you looked very hard, you would have
found things for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it, of course, is unsmokable,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just plain right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was a young kid on a dead tour in
the mid 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 1980, I was hooked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, meanwhile, back to terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoked the pure THC with rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ain't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked THC mixed with resin 50-50,
which made 75% THC by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we did a year or two later,
we obtained all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top 10 cannabinoids, THC,
CBD, CBG, THCV, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also obtained the top 10 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were able to try the different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that a couple of
interesting things, like number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you smoke pure CBD in a fairly large
amount, a tenth of a gram, 100 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: then what happens is it blocks the
activity of even the strongest dry sieved
[SPEAKER_00]: ash for about eight to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting thing was that THCV
is not psychoactive at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people at that time
believed it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we tried all the different terpenes
with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried 25 milligrams of THC,
all double blinded with one terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as tiny amount as we could put
it with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out was that mersene,
limalene, tionine, and a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely potentiated THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the others or a lot of the
others also modulated THC to different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some made you couch lock, some made you
speedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a revelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had suspected it, but we never,
never really dreamed it would be that
[SPEAKER_00]: clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we did it with 12 different double
blinded test subjects with a 100 question
[SPEAKER_00]: survey before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all agreed on the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different people preferred the couch lock
or the uplifting, but they all agreed that
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular compound with THC had that
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so this was all, you know,
maybe 12 years ago or 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we started it practically 15
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I was afraid to release the
information because I thought people would
[SPEAKER_00]: start coming out with skunky sands,
improve your weed spray, turn mold to
[SPEAKER_00]: gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the better side of it is when people
are extracting terpenes from the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sources and then adding them back
to the same, that's pretty benign as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as no chemicals and solvents are being
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to say, but the truth of
it is that it's changed cannabis and our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding will continue to learn,
but it's a really big step forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd really like to see done is
something much more sophisticated than we
[SPEAKER_02]: were able to do, you know, and see science
put to bear on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Situation and see what we can learn about
different terpene combinations with
[SPEAKER_02]: different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 140 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems the most interesting avenue for me
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's known, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what we know so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're really in trace amounts,
and that doesn't mean they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: important, but about 20 of them make up
most of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in cannabis we smoke today,
but there's a smattering of other
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and they could be key also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there could be a couple hundred
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't IDed them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the smaller the amounts, the less
significant they are likely to be just by
[SPEAKER_00]: odds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably also heavy selective
pressures involved recently, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the way of people breeding I mean,
there's aromas people like, and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: effects they expect based on that aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this feedback loop thing that makes
it all kind of hard to study in a more
[SPEAKER_02]: detailed way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important, and those things are
somehow related, but they're not as
[SPEAKER_02]: related in the way I would have thought,
in a biochemical sort of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more related in what we
individually make of each variety and our
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm sounding a bit cosmic for the
scientist guy, but it's impossible to
[SPEAKER_02]: separate one from the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure exactly how you would do
a statistically rigorous test of the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene and cannabinoid data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be interesting for somebody to set it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more powerful tools now that
we have had.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are biochemically related.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, but that's not the only
relationship is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've always wondered if they're
competing pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they use the same precursors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what exactly is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've certainly jacked up both
pathways in the modern senesemia
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these hybrids are big producers of all
of the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not like there's a shortage of
one thing or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpenes seem to have become sort of a
mishmash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more now what plants don't have
rather than what they have, in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes a variety that's characteristic
in the way it smells to me is a key
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene it has, or a couple of them,
but also all the terpenes that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: lacking so that it doesn't smell like
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty inbred at this point.
