[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, I'm not in my normal
regular office right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are actually in behind my house,
uh, up one of the local trails that splits
[SPEAKER_00]: off and goes to a few different mountains
locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, I've got the KTM out here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to maybe get up on the
mountain, head up to the waterfall,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little session, just show you guys
a little bit of GoPro footage as I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: my chest mounted GoPro, which should give
some pretty decent visuals of the trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is freshly wet, so I'll try to make
sure I keep wiping it as I rip through
[SPEAKER_00]: trees and they hit the front of me
because, uh, it'll obviously cause water
[SPEAKER_00]: droplets and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we head on over to the old
guy of starting, uh, starting the bike
[SPEAKER_00]: styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over here and start the bike old
guy style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still can kick a bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, but if I don't have
to, I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get going guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I just got here to the not quite really
the end of the trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really just the beginning of the
trail For people that want to hike some of
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have heard recently There was five
hikers that passed away right behind Lions
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay on Mount Harvey Well, that is indeed
the trail that got them to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe their last breaths Very sorry for
them always a sad story to hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: people dying in the mountains Especially
when you come from mountain culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: you love mountain culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it to the waterfall nonetheless
It's raining so there's gonna be some Rain
[SPEAKER_00]: falling on the lens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could potentially Get ourselves into
the trees here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I climb up there and have my
sack but Even just down in here is good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the trail that I came down That
led me right up to this point which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: waterfall So why don't I go and try and
find something to set up where the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be getting too wet and we'll have a
quick couple of puffs And I think maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of conversation and that'll be
it for this nice quick short video a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of dirt Biking a little bit of
water falling and of course a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys in a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys, sorry for the lack of
talking just kind of gearing up getting
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the go here So I've got a little
bit of that dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh nine cookies rosin right there for your
demand and I guess we're gonna probably
[SPEAKER_00]: just do a little dunk this stuff's very
buttery and basically is Not very dab
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly when it comes to the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna heat up the piece Sorry about
the loud background noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we're right next to a
waterfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be fairly loud Sorry
about that, but maybe enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get back to my pipe and we'll
see what's going on here
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright she's heated up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of getting my dunk ready Get
my dunk ready put that lid down here Looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like we might be going for a decent size
dunk here Alright put that down 29
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds Still feeling pretty decent gonna
go at 45 seconds just because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and hey when you're outside It's
never a bad idea to hit it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go Hit it up everybody Perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: low temp dab Just puddle Just because
we're out in the bush doesn't mean we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be savages Of course, I still have my
DC glass cleaner and my q-tips Although
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass cleaner is not going to be very
useful at this point in time because truly
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a perfect Perfect low temp dab
that brought my my banger back To where it
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to be tell you that was so
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's due for another one What do
you say one dab two dab three dabs four,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's hit a second one I'm gonna put the
cleaner over here for now Lay down the
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs the q-tippers Alright, I'm gonna go
heat this back up and be right back
[SPEAKER_00]: Heating it up out in the boonies my
favorite place to be for any of you that
[SPEAKER_00]: truly know me This is where I love to be
out in the out in the forest Out amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: the waterfalls out amongst the trees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fierce on the on the timer I Find that
timer man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you hitting that that early too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was at 45 seconds last time It was
definitely what I'd call a pretty nice low
[SPEAKER_00]: temp dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my dab for now little guy Little
rosin rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 23 seconds Z because you need an
OFC when you're dabbing in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backcountry Beautiful okay getting up to
40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Yep.

[SPEAKER_00]: Another perfect low temp dabber huddling
[SPEAKER_00]: Puddling if you will nothing better than
that right there
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, because we hit a couple of dabs
there we're gonna hit The DC glass
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep it in small vials to make
it portable and easy to use nice and easy
[SPEAKER_00]: Steams out any dirt and debris that might
be caught down in there any little burnt
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of nasties They generally come to the
surface With the DC glass cleaner if done
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly so Definitely stoked on it DC
glass cleaner for the win All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I'm going to get back on the
bike.

little shot of the waterfall and Yeah,
