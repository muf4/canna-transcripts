[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, well we have finished up at
the Nutraceutical Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great working with all you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash and Ariel and Maurice, thanks for
inviting us to the booth with Sunspice
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasonings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool seeing the Prime
Minister give you a little award there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that I was getting an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nor did I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was glad I snapped a picture so we got
that in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, by chance too.
[SPEAKER_00]: By total chance the way that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Maurice is taking us to a friend of
his place up in Bull Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go hang out at a beach
house for a little bit, do some dabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy what I say a full moon or a near
full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're going to continue on our
way here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see us soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see your big smiling face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to Focaccia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think vibes would be over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: What prison is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the one that Marcus Garvey
spent his time in, no I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many prisons do they have in Kingston?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about, in Kingston I want
to know about two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they have more, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not familiarizing yourself?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not in the least bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in the least bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harry, is that a full moon?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full moon?
It is what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full moon.
Full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon, is it full?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure looks full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well here we are heading out to
Bull Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so this is the beach road,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these properties are right on the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all looking forward to spending a
little bit of time out in the beach house
[SPEAKER_00]: doing dabs with the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full moon dabs for a couple hours by the
beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full moon dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the name of this video will
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ariel, Ashley, Maurice and Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two A's and two M's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked, wicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the Nomad song today about
weed was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of this beach house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mmm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronnie's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronnie's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we had so much fun out here the last
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where Joe did his last
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is always a nice spiritual vibe
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another connection for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember the Jow over Evil video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, little Joe, little Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the last venue that he played
before he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good spiritual energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go blow smoke rings to Joe
in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well it's been a while since I've
been by the water, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full moon in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Caribbean Sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crashing down in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a good place to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice big curler waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is not too far down the road
from Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are big surf culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surfing just down the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surfing right on this very beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well we've got the mothership set
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting in this beautiful Adirondack chair
with the nice shells like built right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the tripod set up over there and I
guess we're going to have a dab session
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some beautiful dry sifted resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to smoke a little bit of that
here in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera's balancing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, so we got it set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Ashley in the far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Ariel in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our good man Maurice Ellis given
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: An award today by the Prime Minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people who were awarded boots,
Maurice's company was one of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunspice Seasonings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all given a nice little,
they got to have an interaction with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Prime Minister, Portia Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a nice little certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In recognition of the work that was done
for the large international interests of
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big smile at our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you got to talk real loud because the
waves are so loud that they probably won't
[SPEAKER_00]: almost be hearing us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to recognize nonetheless that
that was a really cool thing that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really, really surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a nice surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it was a nice surprise for me this
morning when Ariel and myself went to have
[SPEAKER_00]: our wake and bake and we went and found a
nice dark corner that the security guard
[SPEAKER_00]: told us to go find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had her spliff and I pulled out the
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the zoo maintenance guy came in
and he was just like, he was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind of like, okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I said, I bet you this is the first
time you've ever seen this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it's absolutely the first time
I've ever seen anyone with a blowtorch and
[SPEAKER_00]: a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mentioned it to a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's puffed like iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys met tough last time when we were
at little Joe's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the girl that we met at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had all the nice style clothing and
there were the t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well I'm getting a dabbing
because let's be honest, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: why we came here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean hut side dabs can't be beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are under this little palapa
because A, it offers wind protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: which cools the D-nail down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get too much wind, it's constantly
needing to try and heat up and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: really red hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the reasons we're in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably after we have two or three dabs
each, we'll head over to the main event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we'll bring the camera over
there and let you guys dab out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that cannabis is becoming so much
more accepted that a legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: businessman like Maurice, who also happens
to enjoy cannabis, doesn't have to fear
[SPEAKER_00]: for his safety or for his business's
safety because he wants to enjoy a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of the cannabis on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's important that the
people locally here understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see someone like Maurice on
Bubble Man's World, be happy for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making strides for the rest of you so
that one day you too can enjoy cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: even on film, without feeling that you're
doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's be honest, we're not doing
anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know we're enjoying ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not coming here with bottles of
alcohol to get super hammered and then all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden, you know, upset neighbors
that live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought some guava pineapple juice for
us to have after dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple guava, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the magic chair for dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop pop and pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop pop and pass, as our good friend
prophecy says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop pop and pass, pop pop and pass,
pop pop and pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been telling you to bring your
music with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know if I ended up bringing
it, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all the music you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is right now all the music I need to
have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a chalice hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a rip, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get mother shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did Lil Joe play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was he over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right over there.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were both here?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't able to make it that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs by the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to beat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a few more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys probably don't want to watch us
do it, but we'll bring the camera over and
[SPEAKER_00]: show you the nice ocean view that we're
going to enjoy for the next little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just eating some delicious tamarind seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on the Adirondack chairs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full moons in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I'd let you guys just chill
with us and enjoy a little bit of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're enjoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever come to Jamaica, you're going
to want to check out the bubble man
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubble man tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact me at bubble man at bubble
bag dot com and we can talk about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about different hotels that are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble tours, gone to field tours,
hanging out with really unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool people, getting to experience great
shows and just really picking up that
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble man vibe that I try to,
you know, project through my videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, while you're sitting at
home in the snow puffing bowls,
[SPEAKER_00]: puff it to this, my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noticing a fire across the way in the
hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if my camera will let me focus in
on it, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty big fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a D-Nail temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got to click the switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn this bad boy on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn this bad boy on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The switch has been flipped and the
temperature will start to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this little guy get warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, mothership dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always down for more dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is definitely throwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we'll just go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on camera, get smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit hard for the camera to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a 510 degree temperature here
and the mothership is heating up nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sweet doing dabs of full melt
bubble and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seen some really beautiful herb this time
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be photographing quite a bit
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tony gets here tomorrow and we will
head over to Negril.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be there just for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get to this soccer match,
the celebrity soccer match with Kronix and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse Royle and Richie Spice and many
other artists, both from St. Catharines as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really going to be a cool event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Sunday is Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Stepping High Festival with Ras
Bobby and it's the soccer match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our work cut out for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we recycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, for those of you that are going
to comment, I know I put too much water in
[SPEAKER_00]: the recycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just too lazy to pour it out and I'm
not getting any water in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chill out, relax and let me enjoy my
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, please enjoy one with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, tasty dabs as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I might show you a little bit more,
but it also just might be that time where
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear that Bubble Man theme music start
playing and you can know the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: video is near.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, this scene will cut and another
one will open, my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry, lots more to come from
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having you guys along with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please leave comments, subscribe and
share the videos if you like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
