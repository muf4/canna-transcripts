[SPEAKER_00]: I would describe him as being a free
spirit and a character.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'd like to thank him alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in connection for almost five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only met him last night for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the reason why he's here on
this platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings another voice to this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was wonderful to actually get to
meet him and sit and have a drink with him
[SPEAKER_00]: last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives me great pleasure to
introduce Dr. Bob Melby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Hutch, and thank everybody,
especially the organizers, because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what has to happen everywhere around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is happening everywhere around the
world, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to do is talk about things
in a very different fashion than what most
[SPEAKER_01]: people are accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, what I really want to do is I
want to bring together the spirituality
[SPEAKER_01]: with the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in fact, anything that's true has
to be true for everything that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever's real in spirituality,
whatever's real in science, there has to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a junction of truth between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel very satisfied personally with
how I now understand what I call the
[SPEAKER_01]: physics of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we are going to try to explore
how to promote health, both in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: individual health, but in terms of social
and planetary health, we should have some
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of what life is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody in this room would
bring their car to a mechanic who didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how a car worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we go to doctors who don't really have
a foundational understanding of what life
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is true, sadly, of our scientists
and the whole scientific medical
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment that we all live under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tragic truth that I've come to
realize for myself is that we are living
[SPEAKER_01]: in a world of false, to use Donald Trump's
phrase, fake medicine and fake science in
[SPEAKER_01]: many respects because of how we have not
moved beyond the kind of thinking that
[SPEAKER_01]: really represents 100 years of wonderful
thinking and wonderful creativity,
[SPEAKER_01]: but never got us beyond the stagnation of
the kind of revolution that's required in
[SPEAKER_01]: order for us to move on to the next level
of humanity, the consciousness that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard spoken of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, that is simply a natural
unfolding of an unfolding universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I want to try to convey,
these aspects of what is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'd like everyone to do would be
to basically forget what you're thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, what you think you know,
and just go with what I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't over-criticize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to the whole story as much as I'll
be able to get through because it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible to do it in this amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about two hours to give a fairly
full-fledged overview of what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the aim is that the kinds of details
that, for example, Ethan does a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: job of presenting and they're so essential
for us to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we need to do is understand them
in the context of what life is and how
[SPEAKER_01]: those things impinge on that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the overarching themes that I'm
gonna talk about has to do, ultimately,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the energy sources that cells use to
power themselves, to power life,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to manifest itself in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that those energy sources
have profoundly different values to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kinds of things, if you look at
literally all of those various chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: that you saw on the below, or earlier
today, the terpenes and the flavonoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: all, they all, for the most part,
have a common mode of functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we can look at the specific
pathways, if you stand back and you say
[SPEAKER_01]: what's really going on, you'll see that
most of them turn on fat burning via AMP
[SPEAKER_01]: kinase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the magic of turning on fat burning is
that that's when cells are recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're doing is they're
recycling their damaged pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how were those pieces damaged?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were damaged when we made energy
efficiently by utilizing carbohydrates in
[SPEAKER_01]: what's known as the electron transport
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the dialogue between doing things,
activating things, your muscles,
[SPEAKER_01]: your pancreas, your hormones, your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things are always done with a
foundational activation of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to do with the origins of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I really wanna do is give you a
flavor for a different way of thinking and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what life is, what life is a
part of, because it's all part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion of the unfolding of the
universe, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been part of a chemical
reaction, a chemical reaction that has
[SPEAKER_01]: gone on since the planet formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to go back to the Big Bang,
all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I try to do is keep theory in a
functioning mode, because what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in is life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will see where we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the physics, the foundation of all
of my thinking comes from Nobel Laureate
[SPEAKER_01]: Ilya Prigoshin, who was one of the truly
great geniuses that humanity has created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he does is he creates a whole new
vision of just everyday reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are involved in an unfolding of the
universe, and as it unfolds, it creates
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like time is sitting there with a
clock, because that's the way we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trained to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a process of unfolding,
and intrinsic in that process is the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to have evolution,
you have to power life, and in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: power life, you need these energy sources,
and it's the way they work together,
[SPEAKER_01]: the combination of doing things and then
protecting what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same in society.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is build, and we don't recycle,
and we don't care about the pollution
[SPEAKER_01]: we're generating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Society will collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for that is because society is
an echo of the physics of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a key concept here is that life is a
dynamic fractal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, who knows what a fractal is?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to just give a quick picture
here, actually a little quick movie of a
[SPEAKER_01]: fractal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get my hands together,
which I can't do.
It should just be playing, and why is it
not playing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It came up in an unusual place,
and I didn't fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, maybe I'll just have to bypass the
movie, which is a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a fractal is, oops.
I got it.
Oh, well.
Oh, now I have to torture myself more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should just move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, a fractal is an algorithm whereby
it generates a picture, an image of some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort, and it so happens that the algorithm
allows you to reiterate the map,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll regenerate images.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can scope in like you could look at
a little piece of my ear and bring it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you see another ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look closely, you see
another ear, you bring it up, and you see
[SPEAKER_01]: another ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll repeat patterns by a mathematical
algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm proposing is that we look at,
let's see if I can get any.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to fool around with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dynamic fractal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a dynamic fractal in my version
of reality is is that every time you
[SPEAKER_01]: reiterate that algorithm, you change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you change it based on?
[SPEAKER_01]: You change it based on your first
algorithm changed the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment changed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to adapt, you now have to
change back to the environment that you
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this constant process of
unfolding, and that's what evolution is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, again, are all part of this big
chemistry set, but we make the mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the illusion that we are
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the way I look at things is I
look at the planet, the big chemistry set,
[SPEAKER_01]: and within that chemistry set,
you have the biochemistry of humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the biochemistry of humanity,
there are certain rules as to what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in this unfolding process as we get
smarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: A key concept here is that it's not that
we evolve in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that evolution, the power,
the flow of energy, generates the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At equilibrium, which is the way most of
our physics and most of our chemistry has
[SPEAKER_01]: as its origins what's called reversibility
of time, because that allowed simple math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that simple math allowed for a very
powerful development of concepts in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, in particular, say, thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all based on equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have equilibrium, you don't have
flow, and you don't have time,
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything's already done at
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a new field of physics,
and this is what Priggin created,
[SPEAKER_01]: called Farfetch'd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farfetch'd means equilibrium,
thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's what happens when energy's
flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to formalize that
mathematically so that you can have the
[SPEAKER_01]: logical proofs that everybody will
universally accept, they had to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: create new math in order to break the
symmetry of time, because the physics that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're taught in our schools says time can
go backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, are you getting younger?
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the last time you drove your car
and the gas tank filled up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things don't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an arrow to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Priggin's work did was he broke
the symmetry, so now we no longer have
[SPEAKER_01]: this reversibility of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an unfolding of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that unfolding is driven by the flow
of energy, keeping us further from
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a summary statement that's very
important, I think, for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand is that help is defined,
in my mind, at least, by our distance from
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we age, we return back to where we
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distance from equilibrium,
the complexity, the negative entropy of
[SPEAKER_01]: our chemistry decreases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to talk about is how
that's happening, why that's happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: how the energy of our food, the fat versus
the carbohydrates, has a profound impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ultimate outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apply these things to myself as
well, just so we have a reference point
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using cannabis for 53 years on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start the day by eating at least 100
milligrams of oil, and I do that a few
[SPEAKER_01]: more times throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've reversed a lot of my conditions
by combining my cannabis use with my
[SPEAKER_01]: nutraceuticals that ultimately manipulate
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be 70 years old in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that I have been successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole body is arthritic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm HLA B27.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have oncholosing spondylitis
because I've used cannabis my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am positive for the rheumatoid factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got gout on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go run a mile, you know,
because I apply not just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everything else that I'm telling you
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are concepts that I want you to
start to think about, because these are
[SPEAKER_01]: not things that we think about,
and they're rather mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, there's about 50 billion
tons of DNA on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about a very successful
molecule, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every day, a person makes
approximately their own body weight in
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that seems to be a little
bit of a, how can I be making that much of
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP when I'm not getting bigger,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make, you break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make, you break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make, you break, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are flow-dependent structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Prigogine got his Nobel Prize
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concepts and the math and the
understanding of what flow-dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: structures are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a human cell has about two meters of
DNA in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you took all the DNA from a person
and you stretched it out, it would go from
[SPEAKER_01]: here to the sun and back 400 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How small this stuff is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of your cells has two yards of
DNA in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two meters of DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of what must go on when that cell
replicates, because you can't even see the
[SPEAKER_01]: cell and you got two meters of stuff
twined up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to replicate and you can't make
mistakes when you come down with cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: and other illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is total lunacy when you think
about what I'm saying here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to top all of that off,
a single free radical molecule could kill
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A single molecule, one time, could kill
you, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if that molecule hit a critical
base in a critical gene that was
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling cell division, and your DNA
repair system didn't see it, and your
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidants didn't quench it before the
damage, and then your immune system
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't see that you now have a cancer
cell, and then you go and you do chemo and
[SPEAKER_01]: that selects for drug resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you finally go back to cannabis
and if you're lucky, you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome the damage done by the chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're lucky, you get rid of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got about 90 YouTubes out there
that describe a different version of
[SPEAKER_01]: reality, my version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either I'm insane, or everybody else is
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's open for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm very confident in what I know
because it's so integrated and it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: answering all the questions that are asked
when I read all of the papers that I read,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is all I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit around stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ADD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the TV on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the computer on my lap,
and I read all day every day other than
[SPEAKER_01]: being a slave to my children.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now it gets even crazier.
[SPEAKER_01]: One molecule can kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of your 15 trillion cells every
day sustains 20,000 of the damages where
[SPEAKER_01]: one cell one time could kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that suggest to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it says we must have an incredible
amount of biochemical complexity devoted
[SPEAKER_01]: to preventing us from dying from all the
free radicals we're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe absolutely that is the
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the free radicals that guide
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we do things, we make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we make them, we create damages,
DNA, RNA, proteins, fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything gets oxidized by the war
reduce, depending on the type of free
[SPEAKER_01]: radical, by free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They react with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to be able to do is keep
that at a sustainable level where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to fix the damages that are caused by
the free radicals and a rate proportional
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat to how much we're creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the thing with your bathtub.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the water running, and it's going
out the outflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have it right, you can just keep it
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have too much water,
it'll overflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you had to plug it out and you
weren't keeping it right, it'll overflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll drain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are filled with the organization of
life, the Holy Spirit, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a static entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a flowing entity coming from the
universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all part of this continuity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So half of us, in my mind, meaning on a
cellular biochemical level, is devoted for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other half is devoted for us to be
able to fix the things so we can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to keep moving further from
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your chronological age is not what
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that I'm 70 is not what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far am I from equilibrium is what
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be six years old and nine
because you're closer to equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can be 100 years old riding a horse
running around because you're further from
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it all is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about organization that's
maintained by the flow of energy through
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and these are some quotes that just
really capture the concept of this
[SPEAKER_01]: constant creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the Bible says man's
created in God's image, well, what is
[SPEAKER_01]: God's image?
[SPEAKER_01]: Creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, for me, God has generalized open
system dynamics, the flow of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't matter because no matter
what your religion is, people will accept
[SPEAKER_01]: science to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most people will not walk in
front of a car because they have some
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of momentum, you know,
falling off a roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: They understand gravity, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying is that once everybody
understands what I'm suggesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm right and not totally insane or
maybe both or neither, then we will see a
[SPEAKER_01]: transition occurring because what we are
as individuals are not individuals other
[SPEAKER_01]: than that we are quantized probes of that
collective human biochemistry and what are
[SPEAKER_01]: we probes for?
Adaptability.
That's what evolution works off of.
Adaptability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not the biggest, you're not the
strongest, you're the most adaptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not the smartest.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that is what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how it all comes together so you can
adapt to survive and that's what your
[SPEAKER_01]: cells are trying to do all the time as we
keep trying to do things and kill
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the most important take home
messages, I'm going to say it right now
[SPEAKER_01]: before I forget because I'm a total
airhead, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that you have to shift your balance of
carbohydrate intake and fat intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take more healthy fats and
less carbohydrates, especially like you
[SPEAKER_01]: should never drink soda or any of that
crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like ridiculous nonsense for
your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it does is promote free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't give you any health and it
helps promote all the age-related
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diabetes, heart disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a little common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to have clogged arteries if
you're burning fat?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the fat is what clogs your arteries?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you don't know because it's not
generally accepted as reality but happens
[SPEAKER_01]: to be fully 100% true is guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You make fat out of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do you make the fats out of the
carbohydrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't burn them and make too many
free radicals and kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out that that fat is
pro-inflammatory as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only a temporary solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other solutions that our cells have to
not die from producing too many free
[SPEAKER_01]: radicals is they'll make fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your fibrotic diseases are all an
effort of your cells to stay alive because
[SPEAKER_01]: even by genetic mechanisms, because of
your problems, genetic problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: or because of your life history,
particularly the food you eat and the
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins we're exposed to, that is what
leads into these problems that have to
[SPEAKER_01]: then be recycled, burnt up, and gotten rid
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can only do that if you're
building enough and recycling in an
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the more deeply we study the
nature of time, the better we understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that duration means invention,
creations of forms, continuous elaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: of the absolutely new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this second is different than that
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the absolutely new that
manifests itself in life and evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one of his sayings is,
we are actually the children of the arrow
[SPEAKER_01]: of time, of evolution, not its
progenitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this refers to, for those of you who
are in quantum theory, where Schrodinger's
[SPEAKER_01]: box, you know, you have a cat in the box
and you throw some cyanide in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, the cat is not dead or alive
until you make the measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the foundation of this reversible
time-based physics, which Prigogine blows
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the water with what he's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that we don't create time by
making a measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're part of this unfolding process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example of one of these
flow-dependent structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of something that is
counterintuitive to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're seeing is a liquid in a petri
dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's about 10 mLs, okay,
which amounts to like 10 to 20-something
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about billions and trillions
of molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you heat them, what we're all
taught in school is that the molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: will move faster, they'll rotate faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a reaction, it'll occur faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are not taught is at all the
possibility that something like this could
[SPEAKER_01]: occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the spontaneous formation of
organized hexagonal convection cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking that and turning it on its
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're heating it from below.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hot molecules are going up the side of
the hexagon, giving their heat up above,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the cooled ones are coming
through the center and you're forming like
[SPEAKER_01]: a bucket brigade for heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens because by those structures
forming, they are generating more entropy,
[SPEAKER_01]: more waste to the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: A simple way to remember it is collections
of molecules, like us, will get smarter as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as we can make the universe super
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case here, we're looking at a
thermal gradient generating the
[SPEAKER_01]: organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the next slide, you're seeing a redox
reaction, a reaction where chemicals have
[SPEAKER_01]: electrons that they want to give to
something else and something else wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's electricity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioelectricity we call redox.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're seeing here is another
petri dish and chemicals were mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: together, thrown in there, and
spontaneously organization occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the organization because
there's an indicator in there that tells
[SPEAKER_01]: you whether the molecules are oxidized or
reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see that there's a heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all the same, even though we
would expect it to be all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's showing you that flowing energy
organizes matter and by doing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's making that reaction occur more
rapidly so that in the end, the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: is dissipated to the universe quicker,
made the universe stupider quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to show you a little
video of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the reactions I did in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see the color start in the
bottom of the tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you do it in a test tube,
it's more three-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's another factor that I want to
emphasize to you when this thing finally
[SPEAKER_01]: starts happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll move up from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should shorten this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have it and I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you'll see is obviously it's
random, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no possibility that there's any
organization left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the bottom there, you'll see a
blue color which indicates reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that it'll move up and
disappear and then come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll come back and do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are periodic reactions driven by the
fact that you have slow potential of
[SPEAKER_01]: electrons and matter gets organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're seeing, think about it,
there are two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing organization in space and
you're seeing organization in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes and it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are nothing but cycles of coming and
going, of oscillations, of reactions and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries and electronics, everything
vibrating together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're seeing if you think about
it, you get your heart rate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a temporal structure, a structure
in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got menstrual cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things are natural
oscillations that come to a point where we
[SPEAKER_01]: can kind of measure them and see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a sub-cellular level, for any of
you who've taken psychedelics in the Oscar
[SPEAKER_01]: and LSD, you know the flowing cosmic
beauty of like psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it looks like in yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that harmony where everything is
moving with everything else, weaving
[SPEAKER_01]: together, and it's all driven by the flow
of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not beating you die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not beating you, you know,
the structure, the flow-dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: structure goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what death is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a far from equilibrium phase change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to a state of lower organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever it is, if there's anything
with spirit, somehow that's captured,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand enough, but I'm open to
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to show you in a second
is a metabolic map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with this map is it's too
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you're looking at here is a
snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not seeing any flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, there is no time, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're seeing are all these
possible chemical reactions, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: linkages, but what you're missing is the
thing that makes it alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes it alive is when it's
flowing, all of those things, every one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those points has an enzyme that allows the
reaction to occur, because the reactions
[SPEAKER_01]: in your body would not occur unless you
had enzymes that allowed them to occur at
[SPEAKER_01]: room temperature, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we would not be here,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those things have enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those enzymes are controlled in
terms of their function, in terms of their
[SPEAKER_01]: translation from RNA, in terms of
transcription, in terms of DNA to RNA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in terms of the genetic architecture
of the DNA as to whether something's
[SPEAKER_01]: available to be expressed or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole thing that makes that alive
is missing, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet this is, we're not taught that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taught, oh, forget this metabolic
map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is nonsense unless you can make
it related to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'll see is that our cannabinoid
system is the overall regulator of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in your body from conception
until death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your immune system, digestive system,
cardiovascular system, skin, bones,
[SPEAKER_01]: muscle, everything is regulated from
conception until death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you get hungry, it's because
your brain makes endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give yourself the munchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason the plant works is because it's
how you work, and this plant can tap into
[SPEAKER_01]: how you work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason pharmaceuticals are total
bullshit for the most part is because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're founded on the wrong principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that using a pharmaceutical
every day that's keeping my heart in
[SPEAKER_01]: rhythm, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, there's so much more that I
can't talk about related to that just
[SPEAKER_01]: because we don't have the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point here is that what we have to
be able to do is manipulate our
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical flow in a way that keeps us
further from equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we age, what happens is the weaker
link in our flow-dependent biochemistry is
[SPEAKER_01]: what gets us, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My genetics makes it all this inflammatory
crap that I deal with, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I had other diets and things that I
do, I'd probably be dead now with a heart
[SPEAKER_01]: attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thankfully, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, back to the psychedelic picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want all that harmonizing flow,
and you don't want too much disruption,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So evolution, light naturally selects the
survival of flow-dependent structures
[SPEAKER_01]: through adaptation as long as adaptable
conditions and sufficient time is allowed,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I want to go with this is I want to
point out some things that I believe are
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly important and totally
revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly, the scientists will not talk
with me about it because I've rejected
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they've rejected me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy with the separation in
general other than the fact that if they
[SPEAKER_01]: knew more of what I know, we would all be
better off because instead of peddling
[SPEAKER_01]: poison, we'd be able to start manipulating
the biochemical flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make xenobiotics, the way the
pharmaceutical companies are making
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, it didn't bother me that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking, all right, so you have this
chemical that's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it finally dawned on me, well,
if you don't have the pathways to
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesize the chemical and you don't have
the pathways to break down the chemical as
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the normal, healthy flow,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they'll get broken down by means by
which we get rid of some of our garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't know what products are going
to be made along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know where they're going to go
and what they're going to do because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've never been part of the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't had selective pressures
working on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the most part, they're not going to
work other than to generate side effects
[SPEAKER_01]: and give you temporary relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the really scary samples of
that is chemotherapy because and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: peer-reviewed literature showing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you do is you select for the drug
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me explain what that means in my
mind because that's completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: from what it means in everybody else's
mind, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cells, in order for them to live,
have to constantly be adapting through
[SPEAKER_01]: their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to be either muscling or
thinking or seeing or smelling or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing, they're doing something,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to be able to know what they
have to do to adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like a layer of how we deal
with free radicals because when we use the
[SPEAKER_01]: electron transport system, we make energy
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we make it dangerously because that's
where most of our free radicals come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it, we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what powers evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, in my mind, what powered the
evolution of humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the CB1 receptor, which first
appeared with the vertebrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: not invertebrates, vertebrates,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we got our brains in the vertebrates,
we had the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does on a molecular level is
we understand how things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of the other stuff starts to
become apparent to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the CB1 receptor does is it regulates
calcium channels, among other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the calcium channels are important
because they activate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're eating too much sugar and
then the calcium is part of the signaling,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's saying to the mitochondria,
you know, burn more sugar, burn more
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you make these free radicals and
the system adjusts to it, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember the system, half of it is
just to survive the free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's adjusting to what's going on by
shifting all the biochemical flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of a roadmap, a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get from here to the other
side of the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all those possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are high speed, some are slow speed,
some are broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way it's going through you,
the flow, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you want to do is to be able to
optimally get from one side of the city to
[SPEAKER_01]: the other without damaging everything in
some proper time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the pharmaceutical industry in
general is doing is working on the level
[SPEAKER_01]: of the differentiated cell, the cell
that's communicating with its environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and putting out more ideally entropy and
taking in negative entropy order,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But
[SPEAKER_01]: when you turn on recycling, what the cells
do is they stop talking to their
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and they say, I've got enough
problems that I got to cool what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got to fix me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like Trump for president in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, cell first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cell is now saying, I don't want to
deal with the world anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to fix myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that can occur, then that cell can
go on to live a healthy part of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it can't, if it doesn't,
but it doesn't do it in the right way,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it becomes a cancer cell or a
misguided immune cell or autoimmune
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases, et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, all age related illnesses come
from these excess free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where was I going with all of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so your electron transport system,
remember one molecule can kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year you make about four kilograms
of suproxy, which is a free radical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is again why I emphasize how
much of what we are has to be designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're now going from, I'm
explaining why we can manipulate things on
[SPEAKER_01]: a biochemical basis, but how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to know we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to go and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all part of the system getting
smarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happening now is the earth,
the chemistry center of the planet is
[SPEAKER_01]: undergoing a far from equilibrium phase
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is we see our weather
patterns changing, we see our financial,
[SPEAKER_01]: before a phase change occurs, before
there's a far from equilibrium phase
[SPEAKER_01]: change, the variables of the system,
instead of vibrating like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that everywhere in the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing it in politics, we're seeing
it in finances, we're seeing the tides,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the planet is undergoing a
rearrangement and what I believe is that
[SPEAKER_01]: rearrangement is part of our evolution as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, I don't know how many of you
know my blip blip story, you can divide
[SPEAKER_01]: the world into two categories of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have above average cannabinoid
activity and people who have less than
[SPEAKER_01]: average cannabinoid activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you don't make enough so you're
more on stone, what's that gonna mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anxious, uptight, fearful, all the crap we
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the people who run the world are
what I call blips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So backward looking cannabinoid proficient
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Bible says it, the meek shall
inherit the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well who are the meek?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only stuck me in jail for 20 years,
you didn't give me a life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, is my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean this is just ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about a God given plan,
whatever God you wanna talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about growing lettuce in our
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB2 turns on fat burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 allows you to burn sugar safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why your brain needed it,
because it's so organized it'll fry
[SPEAKER_01]: without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always hot anyway, it can't get any
hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sugar burning, your heart, 60% of it
comes from fat burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why make free macros when you don't need
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stem cells burn fat, that's why they don't
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need CB1 to turn on electron transport
so they can differentiate and take
[SPEAKER_01]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see this man has a great deal
of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not going anyway, he's here all
day so please catch him at the lunch break
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know he'll love to talk more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot boy.
I'll see you next time.
