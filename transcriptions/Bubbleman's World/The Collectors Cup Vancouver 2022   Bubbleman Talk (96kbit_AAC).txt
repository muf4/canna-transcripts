[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus is a very important person to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, he's a legend and he's helped
pioneer the industry, but my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: connection to him was one day when I was
running a dispensary, we did a rebrand and
[SPEAKER_00]: did basically a relaunch of our
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just called up all of our vendors and
said, hey, you know what, we'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: have you participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he himself showed up with all his
supplies, items, he gifted a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and was right then and there from
the start to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his dedication to being on the
ground, assisting, you know, small players
[SPEAKER_00]: like myself that I was new to the
industry, it was just his generosity of
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing his knowledge and his clout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say, he is one of the most
beautiful people I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a number of lunches and afternoons
with him and every single time I just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very humble servant of Jah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Marcus Richardson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll probably sit down here for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I begged her, don't call me a legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just the humble servant of Jah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the legend of nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't believe it, I'll give you
my wife's phone number and she'll confirm
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I'm suggesting right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Julie and Canareps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since day one that I met Julie,
I loved what she was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea of sensory science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at a more basic level right now in
the cannabis industry, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: than say from the hops industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're catching up and we're starting
to learn more about these different
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile organic compounds and I think
events like this where we actually pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to the sommelier aspect and
trust our olfactory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things I would suggest when you are
doing sensory evaluations of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: learn what your sensitivity to these are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have like a sensitivity to
D-limonene or a sensitivity to whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of compound, could even be THC,
it's important to take that into account
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way that you evaluate the sensory
aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one would be to if you have,
and if you recognize them, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, but if you have blind spots,
if you have compounds that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: perceive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so understanding what your
sensitivities are and the things,
[SPEAKER_01]: the compounds that you can't perceive,
you might, you know, someone might say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this smells like this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the person next to them is like,
wow, I don't get that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, well, if they're missing
a single thiol that they are unable to
[SPEAKER_01]: perceive, the compounds would smell very,
very differently to them than it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hats off to Julie and Canareps for
putting on events like this and supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: the frontliners, the bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the frontliners of our
industry, so we definitely have mad
[SPEAKER_01]: respect for what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I'll start by just telling
everyone a little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go by Marcus Richardson, AKA The Bubble
Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came from Manitoba originally at a very
young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was 17 or 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to become an activist in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in the Bible Belt in Manitoba,
so we were like, maybe we'll do like hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll do hemp activism, because
going to prison with hardcore criminals
[SPEAKER_01]: was not my idea of a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the prison that we had outside of
Winnipeg was very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stony Mountain Penitentiary did not want
to be going into jail there as a habitual
[SPEAKER_01]: florist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I avoided that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did our hemp activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the first hemp field growing in
Manitoba in over 73 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my partners went on to start the
company, Manitoba Harvest, with the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that we did there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may have purchased those products
at the grocery stores or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically left in 96 from Manitoba,
came to British Columbia, hooked up with
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilary Black, a dear friend of mine,
who was just kind of deciding in her life,
[SPEAKER_01]: should I go live in California with this
guy that I've fallen in love with,
[SPEAKER_01]: or should I come back to Canada and start
the BC Compassion Club?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched the BC Compassion Club get
kind of created on my living room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came from Florida back in 97 while I was
living in BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Hilary was really one of the only
people I knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had known her from Hemp BC,
from Mark Emery's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I immediately became a sort of
grower and philanthropist to the BC
[SPEAKER_01]: Compassion Club, because I loved the idea
of supporting the most vulnerable people
[SPEAKER_01]: in our society, people that are not only
mentally ill and terminally ill,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also homeless, which is a pretty
hardcore trio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be rocking some amazing people that
I met back in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should all really thank all of them
for their pioneering work, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole reason we can have an event like
this today is based on a lot of the civil
[SPEAKER_01]: disobedience that Hilary was practicing at
the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how medical got into Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Canada, of course, medical opened the
door for federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Hilary Black and all the
good folks at the BC Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was helping them out a little bit too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one point, someone was trying to
steal all the cannabis out of their safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to steal the safe, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drove a car right through the front
window of commercial drive store back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 99 or whenever it was, 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she asked me, can you take this
cannabis home?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm worried it's going to get stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I don't know,
17, 16 and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a bit of cash that I just
took at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that night, I went through a roadblock
at the Lions Gate Bridge and got busted
[SPEAKER_01]: with 16 and a half pounds and six grand
cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really changed the sort of course of
what I was doing and how I was sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: helping cannabis and the civil
disobedience I was practicing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led me to realize I wasn't just
going to be able to broker and sell
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the rate that I was doing,
which was at a fairly high rate in 97,
[SPEAKER_01]: 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I needed to come up with something
where I could I mean, honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, it was my lawyer,
John Conroy, who inspired this a great
[SPEAKER_01]: deal because I would give him money like
cash in a paper bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was proceeds of crime if the
police caught me with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he'd take the paper bag to the
bank and it was like, it was just legal
[SPEAKER_01]: money all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was like literally taking money
from all these people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, putting it in the bank,
paying taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, I need to figure out how to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started a company called Fresh
Headies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started popularizing these sets of
bags that I coined bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the water extraction bags that
we'll talk a little bit about today here
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically using water and ice,
you can isolate the glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: heads of cannabis and in a very pure form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go through some macro
photographs and talk about that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this company was right at the onset of
digital cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to give you an idea,
the Sony Cybershot in 1999 was a 2.2
[SPEAKER_01]: megapixel camera, two megapixel camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the first digital cameras
that you could take pictures of something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was at your home and then upload it
onto the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was also during a time where cannabis
.com, cannabisculture.com, overgrow.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabisworld.com, all of these sites were
popping up and people who were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community, growers and dealers
and hashmakers, and breeders and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different people were suddenly like
brave enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were living all over where you
could get in serious trouble for this
[SPEAKER_01]: level of civil disobedience that they were
practicing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we were on a website and we could
all communicate with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the most incredible thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the timing of that thing, the timing
of me getting busted, which I thought was
[SPEAKER_01]: the worst thing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned that it was probably my own
manifestation coming to me as they often
[SPEAKER_01]: do, which is as an obstacle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to get over your own ego
and see past the obstacle and turn it into
[SPEAKER_01]: an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have played the victim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have woe is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost the cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a heat score.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't sell weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead I decided, oh, maybe I'll
pioneer something new like water
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, not just in Canada,
but all over the world through these
[SPEAKER_01]: websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll start teaching people how to make
this incredible quality hash in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: homes, which was the opposite of the other
concentration that was popular in 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two months after I released my bags,
Indra released the BHO method on neuroid
[SPEAKER_01]: .org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his karma was very different from my
karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Indra very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically put this method out there as
a scientist, but not understanding that
[SPEAKER_01]: young people would get a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started blowing up,
burning their houses down, blowing their
[SPEAKER_01]: hands off, and doing this whole variety of
things that is very, very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a unique place to be in 99 as
the water extraction guy versus all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these BHO communities, which I will say
now, the majority of the people I know
[SPEAKER_01]: from the BHO community back in the day,
they all smoke live hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about solventless
extractions, the three different practices
[SPEAKER_01]: that I personally use, my solventless
quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured I'd take you through some
photographs because for me, before I could
[SPEAKER_01]: learn about terpenes and terpenoids and
thiols and esters and estrification of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and cannabinoids and trichomes
and capitate stocks and all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different sort of terminologies,
I first had to see what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't seeing enough with my naked
eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 2007, 2008, I started practicing
macro photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started photographing cannabis with
a macro lens and bringing it to my eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing that world into my brain in a way
that I could make more sense of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a deeper understanding of what it is
that is going on at these levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to kind of quickly walk you
through some of these photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll talk a little bit about dry
sifting rosin and bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me see, okay, we're going the other
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a picture of seeds,
just a picture of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all starts with a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie asked me earlier, oh, could you
speak to what makes a great quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you make a great quality as a hash
maker?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash makers don't make great quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that might sound confusing to
you, but what hash makers do and
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration extract artists,
whatever you want to call them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they unveil what the genetics,
the genes, and the grower, along with the
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir and the methodologies of growing,
all of those variables, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is created.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash maker does not create quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He or she unveils quality if it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that through what we practice,
which is purification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We create purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be as pure as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see in some of these pictures,
some of the hash that I've made is just
[SPEAKER_01]: that, extremely pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a photograph of Sleestak crossed
with skunk number one from DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I don't know, 2009 or 2010 in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Aaron from the D, or the A from DNA,
Don and Aaron, of course, is the name of
[SPEAKER_01]: those two guys, DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me to take a photo for the inside
of one of their hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you took the hat off, you would
get this picture of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all starts with a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, let's start this with a
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, this is a macro photograph of a
hash plant seed that was 25 years old at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time of cracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not keep it in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in a refrigerator for about the
last 10 years, but at room temperature for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it would be a neat thing to
document.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also the striations, the
harshness of the crack in the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really see how sharp it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned something when I took these
pictures, because what I did not know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is also a 25-year-old plant from
Jamaica that I collected in 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I wouldn't call it a cultivar,
because lamb's bread isn't, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: lamb's bread, not breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the bread of the lamb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the cultivar is called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people mix that up and call it
lamb's breath, but it's actually lamb's
[SPEAKER_01]: bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was, lamb's bread would be,
in Jamaica, kind of like someone saying
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be more like for a genre of
plants than an actual cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no one single lamb's bread plant,
but there are narrow-leaf drug cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that are considered to be lamb's bread
around Jamaica, less so now,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one I collected in 95,
and it was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a cool up-close shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see how sharp the husk of the seed
is, and how delicate and slug-like the
[SPEAKER_01]: root of the cannabis plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are extremely opposing worlds,
so close together, and that veil of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: half a centimeter or a quarter of a
centimeter is life or death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the seed touches that sharp
edge and grows out and opens itself up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very delicate process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the breeders that are
creating good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole process on how this
happens without your seeds dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a big part of that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is called a bitumen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this bitumen is like the sack that the
embryo grows in inside the calyx when the
[SPEAKER_01]: male pollen hits the stigma, the pistolet
hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It travels one single piece of pollen,
just like one sperm, one egg, travels down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the calyx, and it creates one single
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This brown pad in the middle is actually
what's sitting at the bottom of the calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that material is this membrane
that wraps around the embryo and it allows
[SPEAKER_01]: the embryo to birth out of the seed husk
without damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very, very important part of
seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing seeds that produce a
membrane that is too thin, you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: less success rate in your germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, I don't know, I find it
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple more pictures of this
bitumen, because I thought it was so neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that's grown enough seeds has seen
the bitumen get trapped on the caudalodon.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the first two leaves on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as any grower knows, they're called
the caudalodon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not true leaves in the sense that
they're not serrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just round little leaves and
they're called the caudalodon.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the bitumen gets trapped on the
caudalodon the way this is, if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: help it and remove it, it'll only take a
couple of days before the interior,
[SPEAKER_01]: the epicodal, which is the part that we're
going to see next, the true cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves that are trying to come out in the
V, the bottom of this photo, they
[SPEAKER_01]: suffocate and they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that is also a poor germination
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it looked like a walnut husk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the seed husk that the cannabis
plant and the bitumen has expelled after
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting and growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another photo of the same thing with
the caudalodon and that bitumen all in one
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all used to be residing right inside
this little husk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's so cool, personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, right where this little piece of
light is, is where we're going to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: epicodal produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will also be interesting for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see these little arms, you can see
right away the epicodal looks like wet
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue paper and it is pretty much that
delicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it grows these types of
non-glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are trichomes that have a
different purpose than producing aromatic
[SPEAKER_01]: volatiles and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, they produce these little arms
that allow the epicodal to pull itself off
[SPEAKER_01]: of the caudalodon without getting stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone that's grown has seen,
once again, if you don't produce genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that produce strong enough trichomes in
this particular place on that epicodal
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of the caudalodon, you can run
into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these things, you can see how
deep this rabbit hole goes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally with your eyes, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really quite something to start
understanding what in the genetics creates
[SPEAKER_01]: a strong success rate of germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's not even to get into
account what gene synthases are present
[SPEAKER_01]: and turned on, meaning a plant that has a
gene synthase of CBDA, if it's in the off
[SPEAKER_01]: position, that plant will not produce
CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take that plant as breeding stock
and produce CBDA in the offspring because
[SPEAKER_01]: the synthase is there, but you need to
breed it in to be turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the volatile organic compounds,
those are gene synthases that are turned
[SPEAKER_01]: on to produce these very unique profiles
that Julie definitely loves because I
[SPEAKER_01]: heard her talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's so awesome how much she geeks
out on cannabis and absolutely just truly
[SPEAKER_01]: loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the unique things about
our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really something that a lot of us
absolutely love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a little damage on the
caudalodon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably from where that membrane
was left on a little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it just starts eating into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant would have been dead in a
very, very near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 25-year-old seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how many of you grow,
but maybe I don't even know how many of
[SPEAKER_01]: you are over 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a seed that's over 25
years old or around that, you want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: it the best care possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here the epicodal is
absolutely covered in trichomes now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top of it is very white.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the two leaves meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to separate here very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a cool picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of a pistolet hare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was like buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just holding hands on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the seeds... You can see
these are other types of trichomes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing on the outside of this
pistolet hare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each pistolet hare comes out of a calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll get two coming out of a
calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how the plant gets pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen hits one of those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets sucked into the interior of the
pistolet and travels down below and
[SPEAKER_01]: produces seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be the mycorrhizosphere of the
root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a very hard picture to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the root tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little mycorrhizosphere hairs are
the things that will help the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: sequester the compounds that it needs in
order to express itself in the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it to, which is ideally strong
terpene and volatile organic compound
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously a nice strong cannabinoid
profile as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a picture of the epicoddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now growing a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to show this because a lot of
people that tell me they grow say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, we don't spray once it blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the trichomes are in development,
we don't spray anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I show them this picture and say,
these are glandular trichomes on the first
[SPEAKER_01]: set of leaves of a seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, ideally, particularly if it's
some sort of systemic poison, don't spray
[SPEAKER_01]: those on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're volatizing this stuff into our
lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably best.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also a picture of the epicoddle
showing clearly bulbous trichome heads all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the outside of it, as well as,
once again, another type of glandular,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, non-glandular trichome,
which is called the systolith hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's in general about six of these
different types of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've shown you quite a few of them on the
epicoddle, on the pistolet hair,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the systolith hairs here on the
epicoddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are three types of
non-glandulars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to talk about the three
types of glandular trichomes, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, here's a couple of them right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, oh, I don't know what I did
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she has this set up a little
different than I normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a picture I took of a good
friend of mine's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Burmese fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was opus from cannabis culture
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it because it had a refraction of
a cannabis leaf in the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these taller trichomes are called
capitate stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these little shorter ones aren't
actually capitate stalks at a different
[SPEAKER_01]: level of maturity, but they're a totally
different type of trichome called capitate
[SPEAKER_01]: sessile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first ones we saw that were just the
little balls stuck on the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: those ones are called bulbus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from an inhalation standpoint,
you want a cultivar that has capitate
[SPEAKER_01]: stalks and capitate sessiles, especially
from an extraction standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind all of the medicinal
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may want to argue this in your
mind, but science disagrees with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the volatile compounds,
all of the cannabinoids are found inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the glandular trichome of this head.
[SPEAKER_01]: These capitate stalks are made of
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the same thing a cardboard box is
made of, which is also what the majority
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant is made out of cellulose and
fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really what you learn about cannabis
that the same way when it produces,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to produce wonderful clothes
from hemp, you don't take the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't take the resin, you don't take
the buds, you take the cellulose and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take the one from the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to access the essential amino
acid rich seed oil in the embryo,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't squish the cellulose,
you don't squish the fiber or the bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take the seed and squish that or
remove the embryo and that's where all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the essential amino acids are produced in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like, this is my opinion,
it's just the way the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to access the cellulose for
making paper, you don't use the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't use the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to accessing the
medicinal components, whether it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational perspective or medical
perspective, it's all happening in this
[SPEAKER_01]: resin gland and I have people all the time
tell me, I don't like hash, I just smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower and I just say, well,
that's okay, you're still smoking the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash, you just prefer it diluted on
biomass so that you're getting less
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of it and it's different,
like when you smoke cannabis, it's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different from when you smoke hash,
there's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I take the resin off the cannabis
and I do it really well and you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't want to smoke any more of it,
like factual.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin needs to be present on the
flower to create the high that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glandular trichomes, three different
kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Astro Boy photo I grew this
plant and I photographed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really good example of the
capitate stalk, how tall it is and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the capitate sessiles next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're producing hash producing
cultivars for the hash market,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's plants that have 40% bulbous
heads, so 40% of all the trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant are bulbous and you have to
understand that they don't extract in
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless processing, they don't extract
with mechanical screen separations,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't wash off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And washing and dry sifting require this
long cap, this long stalk with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: head on top where it's easy to break it
off and it snaps off and then you use a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of ways to isolate those,
which we're going to talk about for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes after I get through these photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another fan leaf, this is always a good
sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to grow genetics that produce
large amounts of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not as much worried about high THC,
but I do like a very dense amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes and I want 90 to 95% of the
trichomes that are on the plants that I
[SPEAKER_01]: wash to be capitate stalked and capitate
sessile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want 5% or less to be bulbous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you isolated these glands into
capitate stalks, capitate sessile and
[SPEAKER_01]: bulbous and you hit the bulbous ones,
you'd realize they're waxy, they're thick,
[SPEAKER_01]: they contain a very unique oil compound
that often lights on fire if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: flame near it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much like the 45-micron bubble
hash, but very hard to extract and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between solvent and
solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a solvent guy say,
I ran that material and I got 24% and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a solventless guy say, wow,
I ran that material and I got 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are dry weights, not fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does that difference come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: That difference comes from the fact that
he's using a solvent or she to isolate or
[SPEAKER_01]: to extract and melt all trichomes present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the bulbous heads are going in
there and if it's 40%, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: literally get a 40% yield higher than your
solventless counterpart.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also important for LPs and hash
makers to understand these things so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not making hash from the wrong
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your whole process is to make dry sift
and you're using cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_01]: bulbous rich in the glandular trichome
area, you're missing the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to kind of go back and be like,
okay, we need to have specific cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: for specific processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, in these tough margins that
we're in, it becomes a very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a UBC Rockstar from Remo,
the urban grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a good plant to show the
anthocyanin striations in the capitate
[SPEAKER_01]: stalk, these little purple colorates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They often come in through stress,
cold, different things that happen to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why a lot of plants produce
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's found in blueberry skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's found in all sorts of different
flowers and it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to take orally, not so much to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is water soluble, so your water when
you wash anthocyanin rich products,
[SPEAKER_01]: the water will be very purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't very often translate into the
resin itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can with rosin, but it's less likely
with bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it, but it's far and few
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bumblebee that landed on a
plant when Johnny B and I were on my deck
[SPEAKER_01]: one day filming a puff Wednesday and this
little guy came and landed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of Johnny B's buds,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you the difference between the
size of an insect and you can see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner here, these are the glandular
trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was kind of a neat photo just
to A, horrify anyone that wanted to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what an insect looked up close,
but also to show the difference between a
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny little insect, yet it's still like 50
to 100 times bigger than those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some trichomes that were really showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see these little circles are
different types of organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have plastids and you have vacuoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastids produce phenols and vacuoles
produce hydrocarbons, and those
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbons are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the little labs that
cannabinoids become cooked into existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the reason why I prefer hash over
oil, whether it's rosin or full melt
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find full melt bubble to be much more of
like a five-course meal because the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory that cooked all of these
compounds into existence is present.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the resin gland, so you're not
filtering it out with heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I certainly wouldn't kick
rosin out of bed for eating crackers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something weird my dad would have
said back in the day about something else,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was cool too, a couple of
trichomes pounding each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect Mon, some Jamaican trichomes right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember what the cultivar was,
but it was from my buddy Archie in
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingston growing great weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been something gassy and
cushy for sure because that's what those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five minutes, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of material that I
washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk about bubble hash real quickly
for those of you that know or don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a way to purify glandular trichome
heads into a very pure form, isolating
[SPEAKER_01]: them using water and ice, breaking the
heads off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very brittle in the cold ice
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mixture, they break and they're
still affected by gravity, so they sink in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: While everything else floats, you end up
with a very clean product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see these are all capitate stalks
and sessiles with no heads on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean that plant very effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can also see when you clean the
plant effectively, this is what your hash
[SPEAKER_01]: should look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I meant by purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This grower, this breeder produced an
incredible genetic, produced an incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: expression of that genetic, grew to
perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I really did was isolate the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I removed the resin glands and purified
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I make the quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created the purity, which unveiled the
quality, unveiling the flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of my mentors, Gunkman Sam's
Full Melt Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been sifted to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a much harder thing to do when you
don't have water on your side and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is falling through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I'll get to speak on the
difference between dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are dry sifted, but they're very
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go back down here real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a lot of photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can whip through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's some rosin and some dry sift
pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some bubble hash that's very
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I wanted to get to, these are air
dried products from Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice orange soils and heat that
volatizes the product while it's drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not using freeze dryers in this
instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It congeals together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all air dried bubbles from back
in the day, producing different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows the purity of the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call this Six Star Full Melt Bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It melts into a liquid and it is really
the holy grail of the hash world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll be sold at
dispensaries for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll be something you see
your customers coming in and asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite as much as pre-rolled joints and
other hashes, but we'll get there as we do
[SPEAKER_01]: it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: More rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I wanted to show was what dry sift
looks like under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw the purity of the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important from a bud tender
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: When someone comes in and they say,
I want the best bang for my buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to buy a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a $40 gram of bubble, but there's
a 20 or a $15 gram of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand the 15 to $20 gram,
let's say it's $20, which is half the
[SPEAKER_01]: price of the bubble at 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purity of this is 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand what that means,
it means 10% of this product is glandular
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome heads and active.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of it is not, which means to get one
gram of glandular trichome heads,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have to buy 10 grams of this
product at $15 to $20 a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're $200 into your gram of heads
versus the $40 gram that you could have
[SPEAKER_01]: got of bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't a story that the COA is
telling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, this one's 60% THC and this
one's 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 40 bucks, 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just confusing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is you want to understand when
you're purchasing hash, what is the purity
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hash of glandular trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the percentage of trichome heads
that are in that hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you need sift like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it to be at least 20 to 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we make our hazel joints,
which are the pure hash joints that have
[SPEAKER_01]: no paper and no glue, it can't be too high
of a purity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's that full melt bubble and you go
to light the joint and it starts dripping
[SPEAKER_01]: and melting and it won't burn
consistently, then that product is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are times where you want hash to
be of this particular caliber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, it's for novel
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact is also it's a much more
mellow smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people that smoke hash,
I'm sure you guys would agree with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not most people are not carrying around
rigs and smoking $100 grams of live hash
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a small percentage of the
customers that are coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want pre-rolled joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want gummies and different drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, herb, eighths and ounces
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hash is still very much niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about kind of educating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun little rabbit hole to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bunch of different social media
you can check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My YouTube channel is called BC
Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a show called Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would implore all of you, if you really
want to learn about cannabis and get
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself some PhDs, go and watch that
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me basically moderating a panel of
six to 15 absolutely inspirational,
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible, high caliber people who have
lived the experience that they're sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patient stories, breeders, growers,
people that have opened stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: like everyone from every aspect,
doctors and PhD chemists, the whole nine
[SPEAKER_01]: yards, we're all getting together sharing
about a plant that we love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do hope in the future to meet some
of the most gung-ho, passionate,
[SPEAKER_01]: obsessed budtenders because I'd love to do
a Hash Church with some of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea of the information that
you have being shared to a wider audience
[SPEAKER_01]: because you guys are the front lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking to people every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I take this shit pretty
seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my life's passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my life's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really done anything else other
than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll finish off by thanking each and
one of you for being a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and being a part of the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: More important, we have our own culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need it to be recreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sell tons of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you believe you get to sell weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
