[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we're heading into the
property here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Into the nutraceutical conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this is on the zoo property.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: The zoo is on the hook gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, and it's just like right next
door or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_08]: What song was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your song?
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminded me, the first verse of it
reminded me of Desiree.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know Desiree with Midnight?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, Desiree is killing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, my favorite Desiree song is Faya.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good wake-up song.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely no vending.
[SPEAKER_06]: These premises will be subject to a
search.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're cool with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess she didn't want to search us.
[SPEAKER_06]: She just couldn't be bothered.
[SPEAKER_05]: I needed this so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just take a quick spin around,
spin around.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a nice place, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!
[SPEAKER_08]: He's my great friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this guy, look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love a drive like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the plant nursery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we won't be complete in this
cycle until we have some ganja growing
[SPEAKER_05]: here in the hopa gardens and the botanical
gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been 41 years and nine months for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the Chinese constructing this over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got the architecture down pat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to live over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they've been doing it for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a longer history than a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a serious history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we just got to the zoo here,
hanging out with the zebras.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to head into this
nutraceutical conference with our crew and
[SPEAKER_05]: see what our booth looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lioness.
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where our booth is, Ash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm trying to tell you that,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right where the lion is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking lion by the booth, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the lion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there, Ruth.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the lion?
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our booth?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice little corner booth right by the
lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we could have brought the pop-up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we still could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because do we want to do better or worse?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all up to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could stay with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a little walk through here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a body and spirit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just doing a little walk on the
grounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go over to the tops and
drink tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Elsa's blend of teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Etenio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sweet, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Skin, hair, body, starfish oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oil of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what the oil of life is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take us over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ashley, come here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm speaking, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got like a stable gun, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ashley has.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not Ashley.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aria.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's what you do, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this how you go in?
[SPEAKER_04]: You little lizardy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've ever even seen a lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad for these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a couple of dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bobcat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern bobcat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big fan of zoos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel they're a little bit like a,
well, not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they're a lot like a jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my whole life, I've never really been
big supporters of zoos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel a little bit weird at the zoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering why people see the need to
lock up animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's no doubt about the fact that
it's beautiful grounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what have we here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: What have we here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, birdies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pink ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, bird?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope I'm not tripping you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, mixed emotions here for the bubble
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixed emotions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big fan of zoos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big fan of jails.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe if there were some bastard
animals out there just being real
[SPEAKER_05]: douchebags and then you put them in jail,
then it wouldn't feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just good animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They aren't doing anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like getting put into prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's depressing to say the least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm not going to let that get to me
too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to head back up to the
conference and maybe I'll just stop
[SPEAKER_06]: visiting the zoo here because,
well, it's not a happy place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Animals are bummed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to be in jail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not I.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some string?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to lift it a little bit just
because it's low.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to stand in the booth,
it's low, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes your line of sight away.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could put a CRD one here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're going to have to go back and
get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a big stand we could put that
would cover the whole back of this and say
[SPEAKER_05]: you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look a lot better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunspice.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go now and get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to grab my laptop too?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be fine without the power
cable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the laptop so I can just open it and
show people the photos and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just bring the laptop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just bring the laptop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it into its case, which is a zipper
case, and it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is one tall woman.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Ariel, and I'm representing
Sunspice Seasonings here at the Hope Zoo
[SPEAKER_08]: today.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here with the bobcats.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very flimpy right now because they're
sleeping and stuff, but yeah, they're
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, let's go.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I want one as a pet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He like, twitched his leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, yeah, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to say hi, but I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sleeping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they sleep during the day and
they're basically up and about in the
[SPEAKER_08]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nocturnal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys have a booth just behind this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just behind here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharing it with CRD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like Sunspice Seasonings because
one of the things that Maurice has in his
[SPEAKER_05]: future is that he wanted to one day
potentially produce spices that are
[SPEAKER_05]: infused with cannabinoids, like the resins
taken off of cannabis and then put into
[SPEAKER_05]: some of his spices.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's pretty much one of his
basic futuristic ideas where he can not
[SPEAKER_05]: just be doing just spices, but doing,
you know, phytocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_08]: No MSG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: No GMOs, no MSG, none of that crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Minimal amount of salt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Minimal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very item.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is your thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a pretty good place for a
little, like a wake and bake for the
[SPEAKER_05]: herbalist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, there's a big sign behind here and I
have it in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm in the same boat, although I
have to say I appreciate the simplicity of
[SPEAKER_05]: the joint, the spliff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta use the gums.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm over here and it seems a little
bit ridiculous what I have to do,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I wish I had the camera filming when
the zoo guy came in earlier and saw me
[SPEAKER_05]: with the Taurus in my hand and the
blowtorch lit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a quick light.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really show them with the camera,
but you see what's on top of the camera?
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuck to the top of my camera right there
by my thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's gonna heat that up and then he's
gonna put it inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember last time we were here,
right before we went to the little Joe,
[SPEAKER_05]: we were at Chyna's place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we went to his backyard, which was
very quiet there, just around the back of
[SPEAKER_05]: the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we decided, well, we're just gonna
have a little session.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll let you hold this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a look, take a look.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're dunking here at the zoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't say enough about the mothership and
the Taurus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super pleasure to be here at the zoo near
the Hope Gardens, the Botanical Gardens,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you'll be seeing much more from us
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you in a bit.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a small world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to work with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: What if she roars?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can she roar?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard, like, females say
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me of a song by Fela
Anikulapokuti.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Caged Bird Sings.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at him checking out her ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm focused on the channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her ass is so fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just definitely is staring at her.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember me, your wife?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: You found another woman in the two years
that I went away.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, two years, not one visit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't pick up a phone, send a
letter, stop by for a visit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't answer your phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It always goes to voicemail.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I want what everyone wants,
repatriation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want back to Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, you know what I'm remembering?
[SPEAKER_08]: Night at the museum.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Night at the museum?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are so adorable.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was laughing with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: He heard us laughing.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, you're so funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to spend most of my time
out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk to these guys later
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Technosol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've extracted, 100% extraction of
lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Essential oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, essential oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the extraction man right here,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do extractions as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I extract, you know ganja,
what it grows, the medicine on ganja is an
[SPEAKER_05]: essential oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it hash, but it's not,
that's just a made up word to make it
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it's becoming legal, really the
hash from cannabis is just the essential
[SPEAKER_05]: oil of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have many of the same oils
present in cannabis oil as they do in many
[SPEAKER_05]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like karyophylline?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's many, there's many ways we
can extract with cannabis because the
[SPEAKER_05]: essential oils are secreted out of
glandular trichomes, small microscopic
[SPEAKER_05]: glands, crystals that grow on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we know through different,
um, knowledges that we've learned over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years that we can, um, I use water and
ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I freeze those little glands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to show it later today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically they, they, when I mix them
in cold water and ice, like just plant
[SPEAKER_05]: matter, the resins will break off and
because of their density, they'll sink in
[SPEAKER_05]: the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's how you separate the resin from
the plant matter in a whole unadulterated
[SPEAKER_05]: form without using steam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause here's the one thing about steam
that you'll learn eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has its place for sure, but heat
destroys the terpenes, the, the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the volatile oils that make up the
composition of the essential oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are affected greatly by heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how we know that is when you smell a
flower, you can smell it at room
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are volatile terpenes evaporating
out of the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you heat anything, you're going to
change the structure of the oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's why they use cold pressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use water and ice and dry sifting
methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I think we'll see new methods in
the future that are involved cold,
[SPEAKER_05]: like a cryogenic process or something that
can preserve the oils as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is really cool what you guys
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Set up here.
Yep.
Orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's time to set this up,
Ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe we should be coming to each
of the booth to distribute the lunches.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, um, minister Paul,
well, who was scheduled to be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceremony, uh, this, the, at the ceremony
today is unable to make it, so he's
[SPEAKER_01]: popping in at one o'clock, um,
for our breakout session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be anticipating him in a
few.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be inviting persons to come
around and participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just listening out for more
announcements and just we'll soon get you
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshed in a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks good.
[SPEAKER_05]: SRC.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're from SRC?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from CRD and you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you guys have the booth set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hydro distillation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about hydro
distillation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a process by which,
one of the processes by which you extract
[SPEAKER_02]: essential oils from plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hydro because you're using water
and you're distilling the oils which are
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is that you immerse your
plants and it can be either fresh or it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be either dried material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You immerse it in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a heat source.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that boils, the essential oils come
off as a vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They condense.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collect in the bottom jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an ultra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's lighter than the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it floats on top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what about, I'm not a scientist,
but I know that any time we heat
[SPEAKER_05]: something, particularly volatile oils like
terpenes and terpenoids, that potentially
[SPEAKER_05]: we're changing their structures and
producing artifacts of their true
[SPEAKER_05]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the heat source is controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's controlled heating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually adjust the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get the oils up at very low
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is this done under a vacuum as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to be, it's all just open?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can always get the quality of your
oil when you're finished using GC,
[SPEAKER_02]: GCMS.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even the Proton HNMR, I believe that
they have at UWE.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the viewers on my channel will
really appreciate that because right now
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a few people in the community that
I live in, which is the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are desperately trying to figure
out how to extract the terpenes from the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously this is a great way to start the
ball rolling and then start using your
[SPEAKER_05]: head to figure out, okay, how can I
protect these volatile oils that are
[SPEAKER_05]: evaporating at room temperature?
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm going to apply heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be great if we could do it under
a vacuum under a much colder conditions
[SPEAKER_05]: and still get the same job done.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
