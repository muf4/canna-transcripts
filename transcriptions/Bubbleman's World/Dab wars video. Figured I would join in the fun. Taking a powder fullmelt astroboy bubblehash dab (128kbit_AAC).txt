[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody at Dab Wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that I am a part of this
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone must have added me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing you guys all do some luscious
dabs every day here, and I thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: better become a part of this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the mothership straight fab,
a little bit dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't clean it from last night,
so that's pretty much a whole day of
[SPEAKER_00]: puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got some fresh frozen Astro Boy
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of the only people in this
group dabbing powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a nice big wake and bake on
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice big pile-o-hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my little carb cap here from the
D-Nail boys, also very dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very professional of me, but hey,
I just came back from a trip and my carb
[SPEAKER_00]: cap's a little dirty, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I have you here for a few minutes,
I'll talk to you guys about PotCoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys heard about PotCoin?
[SPEAKER_00]: PotCoin is like a digital currency,
much like Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is for cannabis-related products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get your wallet at wallet
.potcoin.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check these guys out, potcoin.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of hundred pointers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll start sending some out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dab wars, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
