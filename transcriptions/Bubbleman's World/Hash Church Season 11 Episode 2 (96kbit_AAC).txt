[SPEAKER_19]: Recording in progress.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know what that means,
everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: It means welcome to Hash Church Season 11,
Episode 2.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, today is Episode 2.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a room full of people that I'm
going to let in here today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got a bit of a special episode
today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing one of the suggestions from
Caleb, one of our newest panelists,
[SPEAKER_19]: who was studying music and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he thought, wouldn't it be cool to do
a music and cannabis episode?
[SPEAKER_19]: So look no further.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're here to do a music and cannabis
episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: Caleb's invited a bunch of different
people from the Waterboys to Mendo Dope to
[SPEAKER_19]: a bunch of other really cool folks.
[SPEAKER_19]: I invited only a few myself, but for this
particular conversation, I really wanted
[SPEAKER_19]: to invite some of my Jamaican brethren.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so Kazam Davis, who's in the room
right now, reached out to me now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kazam hasn't really been playing music a
lot for the last few years, but he was
[SPEAKER_19]: deeply involved for a very long time at a
time when I was spending a lot of time in
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I met Kazam through the Lickle
Joe crew, which there was this guy,
[SPEAKER_19]: Joe, and he was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was kind of taken off.
[SPEAKER_19]: His music was blowing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really powerful music, you know,
hair on the back of the neck standing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Joe, unfortunately, had brain aneurysm
and he passed away.
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe he was 26 or 27 years old.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was this whole crew of amazing
musicians that I met through Joe's
[SPEAKER_19]: brother, Silah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Kazam, you would remember his other
brother's name, Gideon.
[SPEAKER_19]: Gideon and Silah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So those were the two brothers.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went to their house.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where I met.
[SPEAKER_19]: As well as Rebel Salute, I met a ton of
amazing people from, geez, going through
[SPEAKER_19]: the whole name.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a video that I'll show maybe a
little bit later on.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's who Kazam Davis is.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to welcome Christopher Carr into
the room as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dan, who just showed up as well as
Caleb Chen.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing this morning,
Caleb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, excited for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Kazam and Chris and Dan for
showing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just fix my Bluetooth here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm having a little bit of technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_13]: Blessed love from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: Giving thanks and praises every time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, thanks and praises, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hash Church, we're coming correct on a
very special day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: And shout out to everyone in LA going
through this crazy fire scene.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that you, Kazam?
[SPEAKER_19]: You speaking?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, brethren?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on, go on, my brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough love and respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greetings, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Caleb.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greetings to my family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, nice, nice meeting everyone,
you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice to meet you as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Geez, it's gotta be 10 or 15 years since I
met you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I met you through that whole
Rebel Salute.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I met your wife before I met
you, actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_19]: There she is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lorraine, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you remember my name.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, I remember.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, I feel like I met you before you
were mummy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, you did.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I've met you before you were mummy.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you guys are doing wonderful.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's nice to have you guys on the show
today and sharing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, just, you know, a little music,
a little cannabis, a little conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: I felt like to have a conversation about
music and cannabis, it would be difficult
[SPEAKER_19]: not to have someone representing from
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you know, Caleb has done some cool
little, you know, deep dives on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were talking last week about Caliweed
and how he started looking for this,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, term Caliweed in music and how
he found so many different people using it
[SPEAKER_19]: in songs and titles.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he ended up saying that it was a lot
had come from Germany, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_19]: mistaken, Caleb, that you found the most
songs were coming out of Germany with that
[SPEAKER_19]: term.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thought, well, the most songs that
the most songs that use ganja have to come
[SPEAKER_19]: out of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's just no I don't even have to do
the work.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just know that that the most songs have
to be coming out of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have been so blessed, so blessed with my
experience in Jamaica over the years.
[SPEAKER_19]: Years ago, a good friend of mine by the
name of Jose Toku he took over this
[SPEAKER_19]: YouTube site called on air FM.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he said, Listen, I've got this site,
these two guys are from the Czech
[SPEAKER_19]: Republic, they wrote all the code.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this was about helping musicians
monetize their music on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can obviously do it yourself,
which I monetize my YouTube and it's done
[SPEAKER_19]: by myself.
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's companies that can do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they can kind of bring you in and help
monetize your music.
[SPEAKER_19]: So my buddy was like, Hey, do you think
you could help me?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to go to Central and South
America.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got some other friends that are going
to be going to Europe.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind going
to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we ended up renting a booth,
I brought a rasta friend of mine from
[SPEAKER_19]: California with me to do the interviews.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we went to rebel salute in Jamaica in
Mo bay.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm telling you, we met everyone it
really started crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: It started with the nomads with Sheppey.
[SPEAKER_19]: And and Evie and Bert and Bert.
[SPEAKER_19]: These were the first these are the first
guys and they were different.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they were not like they were
just different.
[SPEAKER_19]: They stood out.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had these crazy suits on.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had these real pointy shoes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would learn later that they were
really like they were like an acting
[SPEAKER_19]: troupe.
[SPEAKER_19]: This group of guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, they were they were musicians,
but also actors, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because yes, we went to Edna money the
same performing arts school, not Edna
[SPEAKER_07]: money.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I went to exit performing arts school
for music and performing arts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would often came come there to
get a couple of their their programs done
[SPEAKER_07]: at Edna exit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, they took me to Edna Manley School,
the acting school.
[SPEAKER_19]: We went and saw a protege when he
performed his album from start to finish
[SPEAKER_19]: and he brought all the artists out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was pretty cool to be at the
school.
[SPEAKER_19]: With the nomads and they're introducing me
to all the teachers and all the different
[SPEAKER_19]: people.
[SPEAKER_19]: So really incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, of course, to meet up with all
of you guys through that whole little Joe
[SPEAKER_19]: group.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was so many of you guys when we
when we we brought these guys all over to
[SPEAKER_19]: the penthouse bar at this hotel in
Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, New Kingston.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they all came over.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have to put it in the chat so people
can see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, it was so good, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like Dexter Malawi.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, can you say Hempris?
[SPEAKER_19]: Hempris Sativa was there, you know,
because Makaia was there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Makaia Shaman was there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So so many amazing musicians and they just
performed and they performed from their
[SPEAKER_19]: soul.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was so powerful.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember actually like tearing up at
that performance of this juxtaposition.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of these real yard folks, you know,
Jamaican yardies, like real local,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, roots, reggae people.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're at this hotel that's like where
all the business people stay in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like the suits, you know, but we're all
the roots representing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was just I'll tell you,
man, I think about that moment in time a
[SPEAKER_19]: lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was it was special to me, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a real special time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, my brother, it was really a
heaven sent vibes, you know, and trust me
[SPEAKER_07]: how you guys, because even when you talk
about luring at Rebbe Salute, how we went
[SPEAKER_07]: into Rebbe Salute that year was by with a
camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of us paid.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just knocked in with a camera and let
it run 15 of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just take over backstage.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just take over backstage like so we are
the main artists performing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'll tell you, I saw Kronix that
year and he really did kind of become the
[SPEAKER_19]: main act that year.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the year that was really the year
Kronix blew up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really blew up.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember meeting him there.
[SPEAKER_19]: He had that little tiny backpack on and he
was so young.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how old he was, but he was
young.
[SPEAKER_19]: So special.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then to be able to go over to Billy's
place, the surfing place over over in
[SPEAKER_19]: Kingston.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, Billy Mystic.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was like the Nomads brought me
to some places there.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where I met Kabaka Pyramid and
Abishe and all of those brethrens.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just amazing, awesome people, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you, anyone that sings about
cannabis and is into music absolutely
[SPEAKER_19]: needs to spend some time in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is musically.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have never.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, one time I was I was filming with
Callie P. Do you know this bread?
[SPEAKER_19]: And Callie P sort of urine?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Callie P. Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was filming with Callie P. And we
were in some little studio in Kingston,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, one of 10,000 studios in
Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's spitting.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, you know, another guy standing
there is like, oh, hey, could I do could I
[SPEAKER_19]: spit something?
[SPEAKER_19]: And then this other guy spits and he was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there's another guy sitting in
the shadows in the corner of this,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, kind of outside in the inside
studio.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just this guy was like invisible.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he was like, hey, man,
can I spit something?
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he popped up and just it was like
more talent, more talent, more talent.
[SPEAKER_19]: The level of talent that you guys have in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm certain it's connected to the
suffering and it's connected to the
[SPEAKER_19]: perspective of love and abundance instead
of fear and scarcity.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's dude, I can't say enough about it,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Circumstances make us who we are,
you know, and and the reality and the
[SPEAKER_07]: reality is that, you know, Jamaica is like
an open portal for creativity,
[SPEAKER_07]: for things like everybody in Jamaica is a
is an artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the first country I ever went to when
I was standing at the bus stop.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went in 1995 and I was standing on the
bus stop waiting to get on the bus,
[SPEAKER_19]: which was an amazing experience in its
own.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the guy next to me had a little
piece of wood in his hand.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, I was like, I wonder what
he's going to do with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, why is he just carrying a little
piece of wood around with him?
[SPEAKER_19]: But he was put he put it between two seats
and made himself a seat on this bus that
[SPEAKER_19]: we, you know, we put like 30 people on
this little bus that fits like 11.
[SPEAKER_19]: But before we got on the bus, you would
think that we were at a Cisla concert.
[SPEAKER_19]: This guy had his his boombox going and
Cisla was pounding and he he's singing
[SPEAKER_19]: every lyric and he's dancing almost
violently like and my wife was like,
[SPEAKER_19]: what is going on?
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, I think we're in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're in Jamaica, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I just love the energy and,
you know, in North America, sometimes we
[SPEAKER_19]: don't even want to look at each other in
the eye when we walk by each other.
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want to like we don't want to
express our love and our joy.
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, we're sometimes easier to
express, you know, dismay and pain and
anger.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anguish.
[SPEAKER_19]: But in Jamaica, once again, this place
where clearly, you know, people have less
[SPEAKER_19]: more than more.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like Peter said, some living big,
but most live in small.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what Peter said?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bridging costs of living is crazy here in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we somehow as a people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't don't seem to make it by us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how we do it when the whole
when the whole when the rest of the world
[SPEAKER_07]: will rebel if the price is a gas gun up by
one cent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We say, yeah, you know, but make it nice,
but trust me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're chopping up weed right now?
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had some real good herbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude, we should have gotten that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a shortage here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's a shout.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is makes zero sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: No good urban is like Jamaica in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten years now has been into into.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kush, like, you know, indoor herbs and
all, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more than ever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, guys like Charlie or Archie,
guys like Archie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Archie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: For those of you that don't know Archie,
Archie is one of the best indoor growers
[SPEAKER_19]: in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's he's he's the man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the first person to give me a point
of view to sell, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's such a good person, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, when I met Archie years,
listen, I don't know why I meet everyone,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I always meet everyone and I met
Archie.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then maybe a year later, I met Jakur
and cure was like, oh, you got to meet my
[SPEAKER_19]: brethren.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody knows him.
[SPEAKER_19]: I keep him hidden and he brings this guy
to the table.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, that's Archie, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: We know him for five years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was just like, how do you know
this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when everybody else was was dealing
with thing, the archer was actually
[SPEAKER_07]: learning about this right now cushion.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_19]: Way ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, he was the first person I ever
went into a grow in Jamaica inside the
[SPEAKER_19]: house where he was just growing weed
inside his house.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like beautiful, like O.G.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kush, like he had beautiful plants growing
inside.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was, it might've been the weirdest
thing I've ever seen in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_19]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just seemed so like strange and off the
charts.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just remember his little daughter
walking around and this, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: these bright lights.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, wow, man, this guy is like
ahead of his time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I check him a couple of months
ago, I was with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I linked you a couple of months ago
and tell you that I wanted to start doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: getting, you know, being educated about
the herb and I went to Archie.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd love to get linkups with Archie again.
[SPEAKER_19]: I lost his number.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give him mine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or just give him mine.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he likes that better.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give him mine so he can reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is important too.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Kazam, one of the reasons I brought
Kazam on here today was that he's looking
[SPEAKER_19]: to do some interns, some mentorships.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's looking to learn more about Caliweed
and plugging in and gaining more access.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thought, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a great panel of people.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to link you guys up.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to link you guys up.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you all, Chris and Kazam and Dan and DJ
and Caleb, I want you guys to have access
[SPEAKER_19]: to Kazam.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's really, really good people and
anything we can do to, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: help facilitate his inspiration.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome DJ Hard Hitta.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, my brothers?
[SPEAKER_03]: How y'all doing, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming to you live from Houston,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Representing from Houston, that's what's
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting my rolls up on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_19]: They know how to puff in Houston.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the largest city in America that's
still under the prohibition, you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, listen to this.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you something about Texas.
[SPEAKER_19]: For years, people would hit me up.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they'd be like, oh man, like there's
no good hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I'm in Texas.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd be like, listen, there is so much
good hash in Texas.
[SPEAKER_19]: The problem is these motherfuckers protect
that shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not exposing themselves like
maniacs from California.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're still living under the,
they're still living under the thumb of
[SPEAKER_19]: the man.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can't be like bragging and showing
pounds of hash and big, you gotta,
[SPEAKER_19]: you gotta be low key, you know,
even though you gotta be a little low key.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I will say this about Texas.
[SPEAKER_19]: They are probably tied with New York state
for the state that I sent the most bubble
[SPEAKER_19]: bags to.
[SPEAKER_19]: So obviously California is number one for
hash bags, but the second most bags that I
[SPEAKER_19]: ever sent anywhere is like a tie between
Texas and New York.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so Texas is certainly representing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, yeah, they don't, they don't
fuck around in Texas.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember when it was really bad years
ago, it was like 10, it was like Alabama.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like 10 year mandatory minimums.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you got caught with anything in Texas,
there's just like, well, bam, 10 years in
[SPEAKER_19]: prison.
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like what a fucking crime to put habitual
florists.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is what you gotta understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the state of Texas, any, it's been like
this for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I got caught with some weed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything under 50 pounds can be reduced
to a shuffle position or claimed as
[SPEAKER_03]: personal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they might, they might initially charge
you with possession of marijuana with the
[SPEAKER_03]: intent to distribute, which is a felony,
but they, but if it's under 50 pounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll take the, with the intent off and
it's just shuffle position, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: mystery.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like the best news I've heard in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, in Canada, when I got arrested
with 16 pounds, this was in 1998,
[SPEAKER_19]: my maximum sentence was 25 years in
prison.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's, that's what I was facing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now.
[SPEAKER_19]: No one had ever gotten that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't something that was like,
we were handing out like free candy on
[SPEAKER_19]: Halloween, like they do in some States,
but it still was on the book.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I got arrested and charged and
this, that, and the other thing,
[SPEAKER_19]: and then I asked my lawyer, Hey,
like what's the worst that can happen?
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's like, wow, don't freak out,
but the worst that can happen is,
[SPEAKER_19]: is 25 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just like, don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, if you think I'm white now,
you should have seen how white I was when
[SPEAKER_19]: he told me that I am talking every drop of
color fell from, I was just like 25 years,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I thought we were in Canada.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it took them about a week to talk me
off the ledge.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was like, listen, in the meantime,
Mark Emery's facing the death penalty in
[SPEAKER_19]: America.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's just like, this is how worried
Mark was.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, I'll go down there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll sort this out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just go down and face the music.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was just like, dude, listen,
I would run for the rest of my life before
[SPEAKER_19]: I went down to America and let them put me
in prison for like my entire life.
[SPEAKER_19]: So props to Texas for changing that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Up to 50 pounds can be ruled simple
possession.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Personal use.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been like that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is really crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two owns.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can travel with those two owns.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish, I wish, but like, like,
like what I have now, I have a Sacramento
[SPEAKER_07]: license.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That allows me to grow Gunja.
[SPEAKER_07]: For five years distributed, whatever I
want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm affiliated with a bridging call
Raga.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and you know, so whatever I do,
I, you know, we communicate in a,
[SPEAKER_07]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so when you talk about the sacramental
use of cannabis, like, uh, maybe we'll get
[SPEAKER_19]: into this conversation a little bit here,
you know, how important, and I mean,
[SPEAKER_19]: I know the answer, but I kind of like to
have your words.
[SPEAKER_19]: How important is the musical component of
the sacramental use of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it seems like no group of people
has more, you know, music than Jamaica to
[SPEAKER_19]: sort of represent and sing about the
absolute love of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like it goes even deeper than a
love of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a true spiritual connection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
it's a deep rooted thing within,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's like, it's like Jamaicans
not having herb is like not having life
[SPEAKER_07]: budget with music.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just goes hand in hand herb food and
music.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same as a budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it's way spiritual.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way spiritual.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, bro, you see me?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, coming here in Jamaica and see
you, you have, you have said it,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and every household,
every, every youth, 95% of Jamaica smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's, that's, that's,
that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether you're uptown, you're downtown,
rich, poor, you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, monkey monkey in the chat rooms
asking if you were in the Humboldt
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamaica, Sativa unicorn video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's as it by dub club.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it might be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to ask them.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been in a hundred.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Sativa is family, you know,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that was the cool thing that you
guys always did when I linked up with you
[SPEAKER_19]: guys and that whole chronics and Kabaka
and protege and Dexter Malawi and Kazam
[SPEAKER_19]: and all of these people.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I really thought was cool was every
time you guys filmed a video, you'd put it
[SPEAKER_19]: out into Kingston and be like,
we're going to film a video.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be here doing the new
protege video and everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: You remember those old days where Kabaka
and chronics and everyone's in the protege
[SPEAKER_19]: video.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought that was pretty cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Way to hold it together.
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone's asking what's the dude's name
with the blue hole in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that would be my good friend Waba.
[SPEAKER_19]: Waba.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's who you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Waba Kazam in Portland.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: In Westmoreland, Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's brother Esau who has that
one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, the blue hole.
[SPEAKER_19]: But you got to know, we got to link you up
with Waba because Waba has the fire herb
[SPEAKER_19]: and he's very linked and connected.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm definitely going to link you up
with Waba.
[SPEAKER_19]: He is good people.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you want to go see the blue hole,
take your family and go hang out in this
[SPEAKER_19]: blue hole.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so good, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is in Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's in Westmoreland, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in like close to Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm telling you, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Waba has been in my videos.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's linked up with, geez, with with most
people.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm hoping Kittis is at a birthday party
today in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe he's with Chinna and I'm hoping
they might come in just for a short period
[SPEAKER_19]: of time.
[SPEAKER_19]: For those of you that don't know Kittis,
I and Chinna, Earl Chinna Smith,
[SPEAKER_19]: these guys are legendary.
[SPEAKER_19]: Chinna is probably on like like five
hundred to a thousand albums with his
[SPEAKER_19]: guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's literally from another planet,
this guy.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Kittis is just Kittis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't say enough good about Kittis.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's just one of my favorite people to
hang out with in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: And shout out to Jeffi Freeh for linking
me up with Kittis so many years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd love to hear from some of the
other folks in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then maybe an introduction from
Christopher Carr.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and then Sam has something to say real
quick.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say that everybody knows
Waba.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, everybody knows Waba.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Christopher.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just thinking to what Kazam was
saying about like urban music is like
[SPEAKER_13]: mother's milk for the soul and feeding
your soul good nutrients, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: good herb, good music and being mused
worthy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's something that's been
connected throughout here in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: I play with a roots group called
Ancestree.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tree, tree, tree growing roots here in
Rasta Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, I play bass.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so getting in the pocket and playing
with the rhythm section and get into the
[SPEAKER_13]: drums and the bass, that's something
that's really important to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and locking in the drummer and the
heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think ganja is one of the ways I can
build that connection, even if it's
[SPEAKER_13]: jamming with just new players,
new rhythms.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a place you can go with herb and
you know, you could truly transport your
[SPEAKER_13]: your consciousness.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something I feel like we need
to not only feed our bodies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I love what you said.
[SPEAKER_13]: Food, urban music.
[SPEAKER_13]: That for me is like mind, body,
spirit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, music and herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of that spirit piece.
[SPEAKER_13]: But herb is also body and mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and to continue to create and be an
instrument of creation, I think it takes
[SPEAKER_13]: really good urban music.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we definitely feel that connection
here in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been performing on the West Coast
since 2010.
[SPEAKER_13]: We started on Bob Marley's birthday in
2010 and eight studio albums.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we love to facilitate our brethren and
sisters from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had yardcore come through during the
pandemic and through a big, big,
[SPEAKER_13]: big party.
[SPEAKER_13]: And every harvest is, you know,
we just give thanks to have another year
[SPEAKER_13]: with the with the season.
[SPEAKER_13]: With the seed and the flowers here,
home in the haze here in Santa Cruz and
[SPEAKER_13]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome to see skunk man Sam on the call.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I'm just I'm just honored to not
only perform and create music,
[SPEAKER_13]: but to be tied to the community of music
and working with Mo's alley and different
[SPEAKER_13]: nightclubs here in in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big honor to continue to
facilitate.
[SPEAKER_13]: And same with Ganja.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's the inner inner woven piece
to the ongoing evolution of of the human
[SPEAKER_13]: community is urban music.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a I come at it from a
different aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so when I smoke weed, it just puts me
in a different realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: My song selection just becomes so much
greater.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's like it enhances the mood
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the party groups,
a lot of the times I won't even take the
[SPEAKER_03]: gig if I can't smoke in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but I went.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we is, you know, when you when
you when you when you smoke good weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, good weed, it takes the edge
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts you in a euphoric state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could just go on playing music for
hours and hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so true, my virgin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially the definition of good herbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's dark, then my fill is wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is why that is why I really had to
reach out to Bubba Man because I know he
[SPEAKER_07]: he really had some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And over the years, I've been thinking
about doing this, getting myself involved
[SPEAKER_07]: in herb and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: But musically, I was thinking and trying a
different path musically.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I always in my back of my mind say,
I wanted to deal with I want to deal with
[SPEAKER_07]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to find a way how to, you know,
get it out there and plant it and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything that I can learn and get it
done.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so we can move myself and
have others and do what we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What what was the first wide leaf herb
that you saw in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, a Hindu Kush or Afghan or
skunk or whatever?
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I gave skunk seeds to Ajaman's crew
pretty early.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ajaman, remember Ajaman?
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, listen, when I met skunk man Sam
Kazam, who bred the skunk number one,
[SPEAKER_19]: who you're talking to right now,
he had the most insane reggae collection.
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, we rented a house and went to
Jamaica and spent some time there and,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, enjoyed all the concerts,
went and saw like tons of great concerts,
[SPEAKER_19]: made great hash, just had these wonderful
experiences.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, people at first, you know,
of all the people in Jamaica, like skunk
[SPEAKER_19]: man Sam, like what cultivar, what strain
have you heard people say the name of more
[SPEAKER_19]: in Jamaica than skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like maybe maybe haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I used to give skunk to the
Ajaman crew, I did it a couple of years in
[SPEAKER_04]: a row.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to tell me that they called it
Chinese weed because it was sort of yellow
[SPEAKER_04]: and short.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most wanted or something like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most wanted, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up on skunk, skunk, skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see my father's ruling like literally
having weed in them room and man a wrap up
[SPEAKER_07]: bag and veg in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there, I've seen all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, and as skunk man is saying
now, really and truly, what I see people
[SPEAKER_07]: asking for now is Runs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Runs, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Runs has quite a strong flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's asking for Runs.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a hash producer.
[SPEAKER_19]: The last Runs I ran, I got a third.
[SPEAKER_19]: 30% return dry.
[SPEAKER_19]: You hear that Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_19]: 30% without the use of solvents from like
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Even when I get that yield, I feel like
I'm lying to myself.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that dry shit?
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this was water hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kevin from Royal Harvest came over to my
house.
[SPEAKER_19]: He brought this red velvet Runs was the
cultivar and he brought a bunch of ones
[SPEAKER_19]: and I would have never picked this one to
be the one that I ran 100 grams of his
[SPEAKER_19]: flour.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact, I actually got a little over
30%.
[SPEAKER_19]: But when we weighed it and it always said
there was a little bit that we smoked that
[SPEAKER_19]: we didn't weigh, but we weighed it and had
30 full grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was after it was dried.
[SPEAKER_19]: After the hash was dried.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to make sure that my That is
truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas with dry shift with skunk number
one, I got 2%.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanted to clean it up to 99.9.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really low.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really low, but it's worth it,
especially if you've got unlimited supply
[SPEAKER_04]: of herb and you want hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Caleb, I want to sort of get bring it over
to you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that we just sort of kind of got
into a long conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hadn't seen Kazam in a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we caught up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if there's any sort of direction you
had or some questions you had,
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe for some of the panelists,
or maybe we want to do more introductions,
[SPEAKER_19]: whatever you guys want.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm super chill.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm loving the vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think introductions would be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't heard from Dan from rebel
growing yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw people shouting out the double OG
pen in the chat and also haven't heard
[SPEAKER_02]: from Dr. Mark yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cool of everyone kind of
introduced like when they came to form a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with the plant and maybe what
music they may have been listening to what
[SPEAKER_02]: genre music at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a pretty wide variety here
of people really dedicated to different
[SPEAKER_02]: genres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can find some commonality with the
weed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, could you give a little intro?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, just want to say I appreciate the
invite.
[SPEAKER_17]: So my first time getting to participate on
hash search.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, I mean, I've been very
passionate.
[SPEAKER_17]: About music since I was really young.
[SPEAKER_17]: I started getting into music when I was
probably five or six years old.
[SPEAKER_17]: Michael Jackson was the first big
influence in my life.
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I was a kid, I used to dress up as
Michael Jackson and dance around and shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I think about the connection
between cannabis and music is that I
[SPEAKER_17]: really look at cannabis as an amplifier
that amplifies everything that's happening
[SPEAKER_17]: internally, emotionally, spiritually.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so with music, which is already so
important to us, when you're using good
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis, it just amplifies that
experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: It makes it such a profound connection.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when I was a kid, I wanted to be
like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when I was eight years old,
I heard Eazy-E.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so like my big musical influences when
I was a kid was Michael Jackson,
[SPEAKER_17]: Axl Rose and Eazy-E.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I discovered reggae music and Bob
Marley.
[SPEAKER_17]: And especially my early, before I was a
teenager, teenage, mid twenties,
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamaican culture was really inspiring to
me.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, I've had a long history of music
and cannabis since I was like 12,
[SPEAKER_17]: 13 years old.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really what I've committed a
lot of my life to.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have a lot of other things in my
life, normal things like vacations or
[SPEAKER_17]: other things.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't go around saying that I'm good
at a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the two things that I think that I can
contribute is cannabis and music.
[SPEAKER_17]: I do hip hop, I write and I rap.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been doing that 29 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just put out some new music.
[SPEAKER_17]: So first debut was put out in August.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on Bandcamp.
[SPEAKER_17]: If anybody wants to check out my music,
there's like a five song EP.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I've got over 25 years worth of
recordings.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm actually in my studio right
here.
[SPEAKER_17]: This studio in 2015, 2014, when I was in
Humboldt still.
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was rented out.
[SPEAKER_17]: This space here was rented out.
[SPEAKER_17]: To record labels, different like
independent labels.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is on a 200 acre off grid property in
the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it was meant to be an artist
retreat where people from Brooklyn and the
[SPEAKER_17]: city could, these labels could book the
space for a month and send their artists
[SPEAKER_17]: and bands here to decompress and get away
from cell service.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the studios had a couple of floods,
some issues, but everything here is still
[SPEAKER_17]: functional.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've actually got this really cool eight
track channel from SSL that part of the
[SPEAKER_17]: SSL apparently came from a Prince's studio
when he died and his studio was broken
[SPEAKER_17]: down.
[SPEAKER_17]: So apparently that's my herd.
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate being, you know,
invited to join the conversation.
[SPEAKER_17]: I love to smoke good herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been searching for the best herb I
can find my whole life and have been
[SPEAKER_17]: making seeds and breeding the last 15
years and have some cool stuff and some
[SPEAKER_17]: great accolades.
[SPEAKER_17]: I like to smoke good strong herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: My brand used to be called Ganja Rebel
because ganja to me was such a powerful
[SPEAKER_17]: word.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just felt like the attachment and
connection between everything that ganja
[SPEAKER_17]: and the herb represented was really
important.
[SPEAKER_17]: I took the ganja out, you know,
when weed was becoming legal and just made
[SPEAKER_17]: it rebel grown.
[SPEAKER_17]: So like, this is how you know us.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you see this leaf, you know it's rebel
grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked everything that you said.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, dude, this guy's like my
friend and I haven't met him.
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't met, no, but I'm sure we have
several, you know, acquaintances,
[SPEAKER_17]: mutual acquaintances and happy to be in
the conversation with you guys and looking
[SPEAKER_17]: forward to smoking some herb and having a
nice relaxing Sunday.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Mark, what about you, Mr. Mark
Sheldon?
[SPEAKER_19]: I know how important music is in your
life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, I said this before on Hush
Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, music is my religion
and, you know, I was a kid who grew up
[SPEAKER_11]: following the Grateful Dead around and,
you know, when I first started smoking
[SPEAKER_11]: weed, yeah, it was, you know, I knew some
of my friends who had older siblings and
[SPEAKER_11]: they didn't do, you know, the so-called
weed dealers and it was mostly like,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, brown Mexican weed or we rarely had
really, you know, rarely we had sense of
[SPEAKER_11]: media.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, at the Dead Show,
I would smell a different kind of weed
[SPEAKER_11]: being smoked and it was all that dank bud
from Northern California that came out on
[SPEAKER_11]: Grateful Dead tour that I think spread
kind bud across the country.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I really do think that the
Grateful Dead was just this traveling
[SPEAKER_11]: circus that we went to in the late 70s and
80s.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I graduated high school in
1981 and I lived in suburban New York City
[SPEAKER_11]: in northern New Jersey and it was just so
easy to go and see the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_11]: They would play in New York City.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd play in like Syracuse and New
Haven, Connecticut and Binghamton,
[SPEAKER_11]: New York and down in Philly at the
Spectrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was just so easy, you know,
like a two hour ride.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was before cell phones and
before, you know, so many things that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, we take for granted now.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, we would really just not even
have tickets and just show up at the shows
[SPEAKER_11]: and somehow scramble, get tickets at the
last minute and go see the shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, for those of us who were
alive to see Jerry Garcia perform,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was just a real amazing, almost
religious experience because.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you were on acid.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a lot of people who were there
who were straight and there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: people there who were just smoking weed
and not doing psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's just, yeah, an incredible.
[SPEAKER_19]: The psychedelic aspect of it was
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you not say that that was like?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but like, I don't think I've seen it
since.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the way Trey describes it is like
he remembers when he first saw Bruce
[SPEAKER_11]: Springsteen in 1978 at the Spectrum in
Philly, and every person in that concert
[SPEAKER_11]: was locked onto that one guy on stage.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the same way it was with with
the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had everyone's attention in that room.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the Grateful Dead changed the
way live music is played.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I think cannabis and
psychedelics had a big thing to do with it
[SPEAKER_11]: because they were the, you know,
the pioneers from the San Francisco sound
[SPEAKER_11]: that got involved with Keesey and the
pranksters during the early days of the
[SPEAKER_11]: acid tests.
[SPEAKER_11]: And their sound man, you know,
Bear, the guy that they named,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the dancing bear or the marching
bears or, you know, bears choice.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the, you know, dropout chemist who
basically turned on a whole generation on
[SPEAKER_11]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're still doing some of the
stash from Owsley's lab.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I mean, to make a long
story short, Marcus, I don't think weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, like when I think about it,
like even like hash, even like good,
[SPEAKER_11]: high quality nugget.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, when you were living in suburban
New York, you can go more easily by an
[SPEAKER_11]: eight ball of coke by some dealer just on
the street, you know, in Manhattan and
[SPEAKER_11]: come back to your party.
[SPEAKER_11]: And suburban New Jersey and completely own
the party, but it was just difficult to
[SPEAKER_11]: get good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'd be able to get these little $10
and $15 Manila envelopes of, of mostly
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds and stems and a little bit of brown
weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're lucky if you could get a joint out
of like this little $10 dime bag.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, the dead really were the
ones that brought good weed to the East
[SPEAKER_11]: coast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there's any question about
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There would not be the appetite for
diesel.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, ChemDog has a Grateful Dead
Genesis, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So Peabud and G first met at a Grateful
Dead show in 1991 in Deer Creek.
[SPEAKER_11]: They exchanged numbers.
[SPEAKER_11]: They exchanged weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next thing you know, you know,
Greg out in Massachusetts pops these beans
[SPEAKER_11]: that end up becoming ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, that's, that's a Grateful Dead
connection.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they connect.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd had a Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I mean, I, so, so that's my
story.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think, yeah, there's probably a
lot of people with the same story,
[SPEAKER_11]: but you'd be able to go to a dead show,
Marcus, and hook up with acid and hook up
[SPEAKER_11]: with good weed and then bring that back to
your town.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they'll be like, Holy shit,
where did you get all these good drugs?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, Oh, at the parking lot at
the Grateful Dead show, you can get
[SPEAKER_11]: anything, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Shakedown street, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, street was responsible for some
of the best cannabis connections.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, some of the best genetic lines
were as a result of people having good
[SPEAKER_13]: times at Shakedown street for the whole
country.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it is that the really positive
connection with weed and music is how
[SPEAKER_13]: music brings people together.
[SPEAKER_13]: And same with the ganja, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you always have that circle,
the international herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, it was just like, I couldn't
believe, first of all, that this
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible weed existed and it seemed as
though, again, there was like this
[SPEAKER_11]: cultural aspect tied to, well,
it's cultivated in Humboldt or in
[SPEAKER_11]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to be out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I had a lot of friends who grew up
in the East coast in the Midwest who
[SPEAKER_11]: migrated to Oregon and Northern California
because they wanted to grow the weed that
[SPEAKER_11]: they smoked on Grateful Dead tour.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a backseat story from summer
tour in 1991.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hooked up with my friend, Ron,
the pizza man from Shasta.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he hooked me up with a bag of Big Sur
Holy Nug.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just as these incredible buds,
man, they were so, so dense.
[SPEAKER_11]: And out of that came two seeds,
which we popped like two years later at a
[SPEAKER_11]: grow that I first started growing weed in
the summer of 1992, Marcus, right after
[SPEAKER_11]: fish tour.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were growing some, some weed in Fort
Collins and yeah, we popped those seeds
[SPEAKER_11]: and, and yeah, it was, you know,
Grateful Dead tour was just a cultural
[SPEAKER_11]: phenomena.
[SPEAKER_11]: We, we knew each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was through the music, but it was
through our appreciation of psychedelic
[SPEAKER_11]: experiences and good weed and good food.
[SPEAKER_11]: So all those elements that you guys were
just talking about, you know, the food,
[SPEAKER_11]: the music, the weed, it was just
intersected in this lifestyle that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, basically lived to the
soundtrack of the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how else to describe it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, what's up, Dr. Mark, by the way,
do you remember me?
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you remember meeting me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Dan, Dan, we, so we're kind of like
at a Vermont connection.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, well you could, you're,
you're, are you back in Vermont or,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, you were in Vermont,
but you're out or you interview.
[SPEAKER_17]: I go back and forth quite a bit,
but I'm here now.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I'll be headed back to California
in February, but come get some herb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Dan's a producer here in our little.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, economy of Vermont here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how's it going, Dan?
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's stressed a lot of other people
out of the business.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the Vermont market.
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going here?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's getting, it's getting better,
man.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we're, you know, I, I only want
to be judged by the quality of my herb and
[SPEAKER_17]: the character of my, my person,
you know?
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, so I think it's going good.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have really good, exciting herb to
share and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good to reconnect with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And good to share great weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, uh, dive in there on like,
so Dr. Mark, you were talking about how
[SPEAKER_02]: the Grateful Dead Shakedown Street kind of
spread the knowledge of Kind Bud around
[SPEAKER_02]: the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, fast forward to like my first
time smoking in 2010 and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Virginia Kind Bud was like the top tier
Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was very common was we'd be
receiving the BC Bud, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind that was already sifted,
had no trikes on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people would sell it as Kind Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Beasters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind Bud, the Beasters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beasters were being sold as Kind Bud,
even though they clearly weren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: but no one really knew the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been a lot of, I guess,
um, you know, name switches that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I guess different tiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of weed that kind of, uh, the information
about the different tiers of weed gets out
[SPEAKER_02]: through music.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kind Bud is a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, perhaps some of the more, uh,
perhaps people would like to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: like, how did the reputation of Indo
become like as a higher tier item?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because over time, right, there was a
point in time when everyone was smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there becomes a point in time
when now, I guess, depending on which camp
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in, indoor might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Considered the higher tier versus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to get people's thoughts on that
and how music may or may not have
[SPEAKER_02]: influenced that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my first time smoking weed was
like in 1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was about 15 years old and we
had Snoop Doggy Dog and Dr. Dre came out
[SPEAKER_03]: with The Chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing but a G thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling you, everybody wanted to
sip gin, gin and juice and smoke a blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they, and then they came out
with what a song called rolling down the
[SPEAKER_03]: street, smoking in those.
[SPEAKER_19]: I listened to it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Music influences culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that definitely influenced our culture
down here in Houston, because you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like if it seemed like everybody wanted to
know somebody from Texas so they could get
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap weed or something like that or other
drugs, you know, but for us, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think like, uh, the, the, the actual
drone, the actual Kelly Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it hit Houston last.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it hit us about 2004, 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we had this stuff called Red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hair, Sesame and Acapulco go and to get
that down here in Houston was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like something like, like it was a very
rare, a very rare set of buds that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would get, and if you were able to
get a hold of that and jam Snoop Doggy
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog, Doggy Style or Dr. Dre's The Chronic,
you know, yeah, a little bit of that too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was the, it was the, it was the
Snoop Doggy Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He transited that one for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's velour.
[SPEAKER_19]: Even before, even as you started to hum
the song, I could hear the lyrics so
[SPEAKER_19]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was turning on my 10 year old son
yesterday to that very song.
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, uh, cause he had never heard it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before, but I did want to mention to Caleb
before he went into his kind bud speech,
[SPEAKER_19]: he mentioned the BC bud that he was
getting from, that they were getting from
[SPEAKER_19]: BC.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he actually mentioned a part of
the history that a lot of people miss.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just blame the shoddy BC growers or
the low integrity BC growers.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, but he did mention that, uh,
it's sifted that that flower was sifted.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those buyers who were buying it,
who were the American folks.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're bouncing the flower, like hundreds
of pounds of it and just collecting the
[SPEAKER_19]: sift and then selling the weed into like
prohibition rich States, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: like Virginia and North Carolina and
Florida and Alabama, different places.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, I came up on Canadian herb,
you know, I'm about 30 miles from the
[SPEAKER_17]: border right here where I sit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, you know, we used to get small
batch stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew up in the Boston area.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got imported brickweed, you know,
and until we started getting small batch
[SPEAKER_17]: kind bud.
[SPEAKER_17]: But when Canadian herbs started coming in,
um, yeah, I mean, those were all organized
[SPEAKER_17]: crime running that shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, I think we can talk about it
now.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, it's, it's been a long time,
but, uh, when it first started coming,
[SPEAKER_17]: because it was so dense and compact,
we thought it was the kind bud,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, and in the beginning of the
quality, I think was okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: But over time as it was more and more mass
produced, it was obvious that it was,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, harvested earlier, you know,
not dried.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably, you know, had been tossed or
keyed or something.
[SPEAKER_17]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_17]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think I've ever honestly
experienced the quality stuff that you
[SPEAKER_17]: guys have up there.
[SPEAKER_17]: I, uh, I write for some weed magazines and
I, um, I write a column called the breeder
[SPEAKER_17]: diaries for skunk.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I did this interview with breeder
Steve a couple of years ago, incredible
[SPEAKER_17]: story that he told, but you know,
he gave me a lot of the background and
[SPEAKER_17]: history of the evolution, all the Canadian
genetics.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't think us Americans have had a
fair share of your stuff unless you're
[SPEAKER_17]: buying seeds in the mid to late nineties.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I met Steve right when I moved here
from Manitoba in like 96.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have met Steve and let me tell you
in 96, Steve was all in like both feet in
[SPEAKER_19]: just like going a hundred miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was wild to be around.
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did his whole life story in the article.
[SPEAKER_17]: I spent like a hundred hours on that
article.
[SPEAKER_17]: From like a three, four hour interview
with him.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was blown away by how cool his story
was.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did he talk about sending like three or
four doctors to the ER room on the day of
[SPEAKER_19]: his wedding from weed brownies?
[SPEAKER_17]: He did not talk about that, but,
um, I got the whole background story from
[SPEAKER_17]: the very beginning of his first plants
and, you know, his experience with
[SPEAKER_17]: Northern lights to how he ended up in BC
and Vancouver to how the sweet pink
[SPEAKER_17]: grapefruit was named.
[SPEAKER_17]: To how he got connected with Mark Emery
and how all that went down to,
[SPEAKER_17]: um, you know, everything in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, I went pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I spent a lot of time in Switzerland with
him as well in Lugano.
[SPEAKER_04]: So did I.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_19]: You were definitely around there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went and spent like a month with him
just when he first moved there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you stay at the tennis resort,
Sam, at the Codro Panoramica?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stayed at, uh, uh, I think it was Hotel
Splendid on Lake Lugano.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, fancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was the best hotel around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I was with my wife, so I
splurged.
[SPEAKER_19]: I bet you she would have liked the Hotel
Codro Panoramica more.
[SPEAKER_17]: He told me the whole story, how he had
originally had this other farm and had
[SPEAKER_17]: made the arrangements to move there,
sold his vehicle, his hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_17]: And right before he headed out to the
airport was told the place fell apart.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then at the last minute, they ended up
finding a much better place with a more
[SPEAKER_17]: Mediterranean climate towards Italy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it ended up being a way better grow
climate.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so it was a cool story to hear about.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lake Lugano has excellent weather.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that Dr. Mark mentioned was,
I guess, the people listening to the music
[SPEAKER_02]: that weren't living in California,
Oregon at the time, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: might be inspired to then move out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I personally, I guess,
feel like around 2013, when I moved to
[SPEAKER_02]: California, um, you know, I was following
a similar Exodus, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not because of Grateful Dead music,
but because of hip hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, it came up a little bit
earlier when the hard-hitting Kazam were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking, but, you know, I think in certain
parts of the country, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they said it there, Wu Tang's
influence wasn't as hard as, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre or Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really depending on where you are in
the country, you know, for whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, there's going to be different,
uh, music artists that are more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that could have an
influence on what particular artist is
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking what particular cultivar and what
are they bringing into town?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is their crew bringing into town?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come concert time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or come something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, does anyone have any stories
about specific cultivars associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: specific artists in that way?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, in New York, I mean, you're
talking about Wu Tang.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, Wu Tang in that whole breadth of
culture from Tribe really spawned the
[SPEAKER_20]: bedroom producer.
[SPEAKER_20]: And being in New York for me, artists like
Travis Stewart, Machine Drum and Flying
[SPEAKER_20]: Lotus and all these people that I was
connected to, we're all just making beats
[SPEAKER_20]: trying to figure out, you know,
how to blend ourselves back into this
[SPEAKER_20]: culture we were so inspired by.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think through that, strains like
Sour Diesel came up a lot, especially in
[SPEAKER_20]: New York.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's definitely a lot of chems,
a lot of super skunks at the time.
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of just really gassy and phenos.
[SPEAKER_20]: C99 was really around a lot in the early,
early days.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because a lot of influence from Boston.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of great growers that were
circling that whole New England area.
[SPEAKER_20]: Then, you know, New York was the spot to
drop it, you know.
[SPEAKER_20]: Dan knows that well.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that... What's up,
brother?
[SPEAKER_20]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good to see everyone, by the way.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been absent.
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll get into that later.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think the music scene for me,
it even spawned into the jazz,
[SPEAKER_20]: downtown jazz scene in New York for me,
because I was around people like Modesty
[SPEAKER_20]: Martin Wood and John Zorn.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was always selling these people
herb.
[SPEAKER_20]: To be honest with everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was very much a collective of
individuals that were all looking for
[SPEAKER_20]: something for an inspiring session that
they were trying to go into.
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of these people I knew weren't daily
or even hourly users.
[SPEAKER_20]: They were looking for something that would
inspire them to further their creative
[SPEAKER_20]: outlets.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it wasn't the main event.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a part of the room.
[SPEAKER_20]: Much like a new guitar or a new
synthesizer rolls in and it's like,
[SPEAKER_20]: got this expression and you're now writing
a new song as a result.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's what I saw from a young
age and being around these sessions and
[SPEAKER_20]: studios of other artists.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I think if Jay from Happy
Monkey was here, he could tell a great
[SPEAKER_20]: story too about his studio and how that
became a speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_20]: And through that, and Wu Tang and all
these people were coming through his
[SPEAKER_20]: studio, spawned a birth of a new
revelation in New York.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's, for me, those are the
varietals that spoke the loudest and was
[SPEAKER_20]: on the tip of everyone's tongue.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was always a gas.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you either had a jack or you had
that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And there was really no, sure,
you had your piff, which I believe was
[SPEAKER_20]: more of a mango influence haze.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just my nose and my palate is really,
makes me believe that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then these muted tones were really
street corners that didn't have the
[SPEAKER_20]: greatest herbs.
[SPEAKER_20]: So they sold what they had.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's the blend that I was
associated with as a young kid growing up
[SPEAKER_20]: around it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And my cousins in Staten Island and my
extended family in Staten Island,
[SPEAKER_20]: that was what they always had around from
New York.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's my piece on association with
that.
[SPEAKER_20]: That realm in Brooklyn and the Fibros.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yo, can I tell a cool Wu Tang story?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, dude, of course.
[SPEAKER_17]: First, I'll say that the two most
influential songs in terms of the herb
[SPEAKER_17]: that you smoked for me when I was a kid
was Cypress Hill, because hits from the
[SPEAKER_17]: bong, just like everyone that I knew,
we were obsessed with bongs.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were building bongs out of everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were trying to get bongs.
[SPEAKER_17]: So big ups to bong hits.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the whole album of Kai,
and Bob Marley was also the biggest to
[SPEAKER_17]: this.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the most influential weed smoking
music of my life is the whole album of
[SPEAKER_17]: Kaia.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've smoked so much weed to that album.
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, cool Wu Tang story.
[SPEAKER_17]: In Vermont, we got to throw a New Year's
party with one of the dispensaries that we
[SPEAKER_17]: work with that has a music venue.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we did a show with Capadonna and
Inspect the Deck, who are arguably my two
[SPEAKER_17]: favorite Wu Tang artists.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyway, we sponsored the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, shout them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Noah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this place.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a little cheesy, but it was cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: We did a pre-roll with my double OG cam
and put the flyer for the show on the
[SPEAKER_17]: thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they came and signed autograph.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't bother them with autographs.
[SPEAKER_17]: But when I got to meet them, the first
time I ever rapped in my life was
[SPEAKER_17]: listening to 36 Chambers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And people in a room were freestyling.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the very first thing that really
got me into rapping.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I meet Inspect the Deck and
Capadonna.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I give them my herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I show them this weed with the leaf on
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I go to Inspect the Deck.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I go, yes, this is my shit,
Rebel Grown.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, you know I'm the rebel,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Rebel INS.
[SPEAKER_17]: I go, yeah, I know, me too.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the whole night, they were just
chiefin' blunts of my herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to this day, it was one of the most
amazing rap performances I saw live.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I got to open up for them.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I did a set and opened up for them.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a cool night.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the cool story is I have a couple of
producers in LA.
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of them is this dude, Salam Rec.
[SPEAKER_17]: Who is Warren G's DJ.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's real tight with the dog pound.
[SPEAKER_17]: And several other people.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I send Salam, my California weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I send him a box of jars.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I told him, if you're around artists
like Dazz and Corrupt and Easy E Son,
[SPEAKER_17]: I would really love it if you could give
them my herb and try to get them turned on
[SPEAKER_17]: to it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So he calls me about a month after the
Wu-Tang show.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, you'll never believe who was in
my studio last night.
[SPEAKER_17]: Capadonna and Killer Priest.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was like, yo, did you have the rebel
herb?
[SPEAKER_17]: He's like, oh, he saw it right away and
was like, oh, I was just chilling with
[SPEAKER_17]: white boy in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Wu-Tang's really inspirational.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's been cool to connect with those
guys through herb and get to share herb on
[SPEAKER_17]: both coasts with Capadonna.
[SPEAKER_17]: And my hope is to pursue finding some
natural, organic way of getting to collab
[SPEAKER_17]: with them more.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shouts to the Wu.
[SPEAKER_19]: Witty, unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't ever really meet them,
but I was in Amsterdam one year at my
[SPEAKER_19]: hotel and it took me years to find this
hotel.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was the Krasnopolski.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was this big, fancy Russian hotel in
Dam Square in the city center of
[SPEAKER_19]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I had learned, and I can't even
remember who told me, but it was like a
[SPEAKER_19]: long time ago, 25 years ago now,
was that they had another building
[SPEAKER_19]: attached to their hotel that was like
apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they weren't rooms because the first
time I went to this hotel, it was just
[SPEAKER_19]: like this two fancy red velvet carpets and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: And like you're in this tiny little room
that just has a little bed and it's like
[SPEAKER_19]: 500 guilders.
[SPEAKER_19]: This was before the euros.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I found these apartments eventually
and it was like the sickest deal.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were like 250 bucks a night and it
had a kitchen and an upstairs with a bed.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was just on the back end of the of
the Krasnopolski, but it was their
[SPEAKER_19]: apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: But they would never tell you that they
had apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm standing there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been going there for probably three
or four years at this point.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm at the desk and this dude is kind
of flipping out.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, look, I got all these rooms.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're way too small.
[SPEAKER_19]: My guys can't fit in these rooms.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have anything bigger?
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, she couldn't just say,
oh, actually, sir, yes, we have these
[SPEAKER_19]: apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just don't do that in Holland for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this guy's losing his mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm like, listen, dude, let me give
you a tip.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just need to ask for the apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you say that, she'll say yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And she'll probably rent you like four or
five apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, it ended up being the Wu Tang
plan.
[SPEAKER_19]: This dude was their manager.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, they were staying.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a small apartment where it was just
like each floor had like two of these
[SPEAKER_19]: apartments.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was basically me staying in one of
them with like, you know, eight or nine of
[SPEAKER_19]: the Wu Tang members staying in the other
ones.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty cool experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shouts to the Wu.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a West Coast story.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a quick, yeah, just one cultivar
that comes to mind with music is Purple
[SPEAKER_13]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I remember the first time I heard
Jimi Hendrix on vinyl, sitting down like a
[SPEAKER_13]: toddler.
[SPEAKER_13]: My dad pulled out a vinyl record and he
said, son, I want you to hear something
[SPEAKER_13]: and put on.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the first time I heard that riff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of changed something in my head
and it kind of reminds me of the first
[SPEAKER_13]: time I tried Herb.
[SPEAKER_13]: They call me Smiley from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first time I tried my first puff
was actually Purple Haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was prophetic what happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, something changed in my
brain when I took a puff of Purple Haze
[SPEAKER_13]: and we listened to that song.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in an orchard in El Dorado County
during a snowstorm.
[SPEAKER_13]: I skipped fourth period when I was 14.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's actually pretty profound
because like these are key moments in my
[SPEAKER_13]: life, you know, over your decades as you
grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: You remember key great moments,
great moments in your history.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that one cultivar, that one song
and that beginning riff by Jimi Hendrix is
[SPEAKER_13]: something that I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is amazing that cannabis connection
to music specifically.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it kind of set me on that path of
like, I want to, you know, I want to jam.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that specific cultivar and living in
Santa Cruz full circle is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Home of the Haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, since I was like a toddler,
to high school to now being, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: I got my own toddlers.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll turn them on to some Purple Haze,
Jimi Hendrix after this show.
[SPEAKER_13]: What year did you smoke Purple Haze?
[SPEAKER_13]: 2001, 2000.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, it was early, it was like maybe 25
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was not the Haze brothers
growing that Purple Haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish, I really wish it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stopped growing the two different
Haze brothers were my neighbors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them lived on one side of me,
the other one lived on the other side of
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they quit, they both quit growing the
original Haze, which I thought was the
[SPEAKER_04]: finest weed in the world, including Purple
Haze by, I don't know, maybe 1980 or the
mid-1980s.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had quit growing Haze and they both
grew Skunk because it was so much faster
[SPEAKER_04]: and easier.
[SPEAKER_19]: How crazy is it that Haze, Skunk,
Haze?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like you had two Haze brothers living next
door to you on either side of your house
[SPEAKER_19]: and you're Skunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was South County, Santa Cruz,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Skunk Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was South County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's where I lived in South
County.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I developed Skunk number one,
but the Haze was grown in both Santa Cruz,
[SPEAKER_04]: just outside the city limit and also in
Aptos and also in Aromas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was growing it in, in Watsonville.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when I was growing for Wham for Val
Corral, I was kind of feeling the vibes
[SPEAKER_13]: of, Oh, I think this is where where things
went down, you know, in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Valery and Michael are still good friends
of mine.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pleasure to connect with you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's beautiful that music and cannabis
brings us together.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give a short story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the first, it's kind of music
related.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first seed I ever planted was in 1965
in Hollywood at Sunset and Vine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Wallach Music City's flower box
outside there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody knows of Wallach
Music City.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be before Tower Records,
the coolest place to buy music,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I just grew Mexican seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they weren't nothing super
special, but they got a foot or two tall
[SPEAKER_04]: before either the garden or cut them down
or one of the people that were hanging out
[SPEAKER_04]: on Sunset Boulevard spotted them and
harvested them for the revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, the music I was
actually listening to at that time was
[SPEAKER_04]: people like Buffalo Springfield,
Jefferson Airplane.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the music.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I liked back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I moved to Santa Cruz in 1972,
a few years later, we were able to see Bob
[SPEAKER_04]: Marley played at the Santa Cruz Civic
twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went and saw him both times.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second time we had our daughter with
us, she was only two or three years old,
[SPEAKER_04]: let me choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Santa Cruz Civic used to be my
favorite place to go see music because it
[SPEAKER_04]: was small, maybe at the most one or 2,000
people fit in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, I saw so much good music there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of reggae.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first two times I saw Bob Marley
were there also, which was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a bootleg copy of that 1972 show in
the Santa Cruz Civic.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a local guy here on the west side.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't 72.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 78 in July and 79 for the
end of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I saw him the second time,
he did not have the energy left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could tell something was wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's legend, a place of legend.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the Civic, I saw Willie Nelson
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: To this day, it's still going,
but I don't know if it's not quite where
[SPEAKER_13]: it used to be in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_13]: That said though, there's a lot of good
energy in that space for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I left was because the
state and federal government were flying
[SPEAKER_04]: airplanes and looking for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got out of Dodge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Babylon sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1985, it was getting pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that the year that they were doing all
those, what was it called?
[SPEAKER_19]: The Beaverland Dam patches or artwork was
done?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like too damn close?
[SPEAKER_19]: Wasn't that like 84, 85, 86?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was, you're talking about Beaver
brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beaver brand, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beaverland brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: He did it like four, five, six years in a
row.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first one was damn good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last one was damn bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn close with the helicopter flight.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember damn close.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sam has the just most epic collection of
shit you don't even know exists that will
[SPEAKER_19]: be artifacts in the cannabis world one
day.
[SPEAKER_19]: They are already, they're just epic.
[SPEAKER_19]: At first when you look at it, you're kind
of like, oh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_19]: And then as it hits you, you're like,
oh, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have these- It's illegal
underground cannabis labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: For ounces and pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the equivalent of orange crate
art or vegetable crate art, but it was for
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but you had like the bags for the
Lebanese hash and you had like the tie
[SPEAKER_19]: stick.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I've got them all.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have, it's a part of history,
you guys, for most of us that have only
[SPEAKER_19]: heard stories to be able to tie and watch
the sort of like actual like, oh,
[SPEAKER_19]: these are the little bags that the hash
was wrapped in.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the tie stick.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, it's just pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the labels, I knew all of the people
who made them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also made labels for my seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was, we were all using the same
artists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pat Ryan in the North down to
[SPEAKER_04]: all shut them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you seem to remember them all back.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be cool to get, it'd be cool to make
a book of some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, except for, I really collected it
for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be nice to share them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've considered putting them online on
the website, but yeah, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a great archive at the Henry
Miller or the library at UCSC.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I could see like a skunk man Sam
archive.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little museum thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, giving some homage to the young
slugs going to school.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's important to document and
have a little exhibit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you know this,
but the Hatch Museum in Amsterdam was
[SPEAKER_04]: actually started by me and Bob Warren and
Ben drunkards bought the building and took
[SPEAKER_04]: over the museum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually he ended up putting in a lot
more money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he built that one in Barcelona,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's bonkers actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: That one in Barcelona is bonkers.
[SPEAKER_19]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we broadcast something from there
together.
[SPEAKER_19]: We did.
[SPEAKER_19]: We did for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it might've been a hash church
actually, but yeah, it's a 16th century
[SPEAKER_19]: building.
[SPEAKER_19]: And instead of restoring it, he,
I don't know what the hell the- Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: he spent a few million dollars and four
years restoring it first of all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it was like, the way he explained it,
it was like he dug, he lifted all the dirt
[SPEAKER_19]: off and like exposed what was there and
just, yeah, it was just incredible,
[SPEAKER_19]: incredible building.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're in Barcelona, it's definitely
worth whatever, even if it's 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_19]: euros, it's well worth, walking through
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: The collection is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, yeah, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's worth seeing anyway, in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: That and the Gotti buildings in Barcelona,
both of those, I really like Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a pretty cool city.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like to rent a motorcycle when I'm in
Barcelona and boot around on a motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like the quickest way to get around
and it seems like they have more of a
[SPEAKER_19]: motorcycle culture where the cars aren't
running them over.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people in Barcelona use metros
too, underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had some other questions that I had
created here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, we still didn't see, there's a couple
of people that never ended up showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a few, Nick says he's going
to hop on in 15 or so minutes.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there's no rush.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I sent you the link, my friend,
but I will send it again.
[SPEAKER_20]: Apologies for my tardiness.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've had, my father passed away December
17th, so I've been kind of dealing with
[SPEAKER_20]: all the posts of that.
[SPEAKER_20]: But then the rest yesterday, so it's been
a whirlwind.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_19]: That might have been the hardest time of
my life when my father died.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I don't want to turn the show into
that, but I just want to keep it light.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: We definitely want to, we've been thinking
about you anyway each week that you've
[SPEAKER_19]: been going through all this stuff and
haven't been here and we're glad to have
[SPEAKER_19]: you back, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good to be with y'all.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was actually thinking, yeah,
I was thinking about, as you were saying,
[SPEAKER_20]: what artists like what varietals?
[SPEAKER_20]: And as the older self coming up through
all that, I don't think anyone could
[SPEAKER_20]: really call it out because it took
individuals like us to come in the room to
[SPEAKER_20]: be like, yo, this is this.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_20]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because musicians are largely,
their headspace are occupying stonic
[SPEAKER_20]: territories and they're thinking about
other things than what is right for them.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it takes experience through
trying things for them to find what works,
[SPEAKER_20]: but it largely takes a conduit and someone
who is obsessive with that medium or art
[SPEAKER_20]: form, if you will.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think when you bring that into the
room, it lifts up the room.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then and only then can they call those
things out.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like Dan gave them the jar.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they were in the studio and he
cracks it open.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's to me, that's an artist
discovering something, something,
[SPEAKER_20]: the magic in the mundane in a sense.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like they're just like it's in a jar and I
open it and then there's the magic.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's a name.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I always find that that comes after.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think from an artist's point of
view, I don't think they're searching as
[SPEAKER_20]: much, at least back then.
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe today it's more because there's more
information and we all know more.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I don't remember someone being like,
can you give me this?
[SPEAKER_20]: It was never.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember going in as a delivery,
being like, only after time was that that
[SPEAKER_20]: that relationship developed.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then can I see what else you have?
[SPEAKER_20]: But largely it was what do you think I
should have?
[SPEAKER_20]: Very, very similar to today in a lot of
respect, but with a different twist to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so would you characterize that
as kind of like a relationship between the
[SPEAKER_02]: artist and a specific rower or breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a trust there and then
really whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we had this kid that was in with all
the hip hop guys and he would take our
[SPEAKER_20]: work and bring it in with them.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he'd be like, yo, Rolex, this guy
likes that this guy like, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: and and we would then arm him with other
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was a part of a management team.
[SPEAKER_20]: And and, you know, there was it was,
you know, he had the authority and there's
[SPEAKER_20]: always someone with an authority within a
circle.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I found that largely how I got through
to people was utilizing the not only the
[SPEAKER_20]: assistants, but the managers and then the
assistant managers and all these people
[SPEAKER_20]: that got us into the circles.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then and then you respect this is
talking like early 2000s, way back in the
[SPEAKER_20]: early days of this room for me.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's how our you know, it kind of
moved, you know, you weren't just like
[SPEAKER_20]: invited into a room with all these guys,
right?
[SPEAKER_20]: It took time to develop that relationship,
you know, and then the trust was born from
[SPEAKER_20]: that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it was just like creature havoc,
like called the call the guy.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that's a lot largely a lot of
my experience, at least personal
[SPEAKER_20]: experience with it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what anyone else has had.
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, I said sour and then I was
like, that was only after I was like,
[SPEAKER_20]: guys, you should try this and try that and
try this, you know, and it was more
[SPEAKER_20]: influencing them to to try stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they then, you know, it's like music,
you listen to it, you're like,
[SPEAKER_20]: I want more of that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I listen to more of that?
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that was.
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'm very honest about it, I think
that's really how a lot of this was was
[SPEAKER_20]: done.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if anyone could really call
things by name, because we didn't really
[SPEAKER_20]: we had like four way and like,
you know, skunk and Hydra, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: it wasn't like it is now like these names
came in and really the 2000s for us as as,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, brokers and stuff, you know,
it was just we didn't really have this
[SPEAKER_20]: vernacular like we have today,
if I'm really, really honest, I mean,
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, Mark, you know, it's got
it's got done like you even growing up in
[SPEAKER_20]: the 80s, like what what what were the
terms like were people really calling
[SPEAKER_20]: things by varietal names?
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't really remember that.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember certain varieties like I
remember things like Matanuska Thunderfuck
[SPEAKER_11]: and Yup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Monkey Paw and P. Bud and yeah,
things just sort of had like a slang in
[SPEAKER_11]: the vernacular, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, kind of was sort of recognized as
being just dense sense of media could be
[SPEAKER_11]: fruity, could be gassy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it was it was strange
specific until like the 90s on fish tour.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first time I heard the word bubble
hash was right around the time Marcus,
[SPEAKER_11]: you started going to shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think bubble hash entered the
vernacular during the fish, at least
[SPEAKER_11]: during my life.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: Funny enough, all of my fish activity,
like almost all of it was pre bubble
[SPEAKER_19]: bubble would have hit like I started going
to see fish in ninety three.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, ninety nine was when I coined the
term bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's an interesting thing because
you were talking about the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_19]: earlier and we've been talking about,
you know, Collins talking about like how
[SPEAKER_19]: you can influence musicians with your herb
and then if you can get those cultivars
[SPEAKER_19]: liked by those musician musicians and then
they sing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, listen, I wasn't a huge ludicrous
fan, but when I heard that blueberry yum
[SPEAKER_19]: yum song when it first came out,
I was just like cranking that thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, dude, I wanted blueberry.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like trying to reach out to DJ Short
and be like, well, I got to get the
[SPEAKER_19]: blueberry again, like this blueberry.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then then my friend Kayla started the
company here in Canada and has a cultivar
[SPEAKER_19]: called blueberry yum yum.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if she's growing it like
aquaponically or what it is, but it it
[SPEAKER_19]: literally looks like the weed from the
video.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like it's just fluffy, big, round,
coated, crystal, lovely buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't even smoke flour like flour is
next to useless for me unless I can
[SPEAKER_19]: somehow bounce the resin off of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or if I can, you know, I can vaporize it
and get get that flavor profile that way.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I kind of went about things a little
differently because, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: I of course I hooked up a gazillion
musicians over the years that it had
[SPEAKER_19]: inspired me that I was going to then
reinspire by saying, hey, listen,
[SPEAKER_19]: if you're somewhere you need, I still to
this day have musicians literally like,
[SPEAKER_19]: hey, I'm in Frankfurt, Germany.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you can you help me out?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just like, oh, yeah, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_19]: So and so like there's good people now
around the world helping people out with
[SPEAKER_19]: with with the good job herbs.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, starting bubble bags was a
little different because, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: the way Colin was like, you had to earn
that trust for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I sold bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was transparent.
[SPEAKER_19]: I taught people how to do the process.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then that was it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had earned their trust.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like in a very short period of time,
at a time where it was very, very illegal,
[SPEAKER_19]: many, many, many people would invite me
right into their home where they were
[SPEAKER_19]: making hash, like, like completely expose
themselves in a way that like I had earned
[SPEAKER_19]: a very deep trust.
[SPEAKER_19]: And everywhere I went, like every country,
every city, wherever I went, I'd always
[SPEAKER_19]: meet someone that was like wanted to just
show me all their shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was really like wrap your head
around it during a time where you could
[SPEAKER_19]: get in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I somehow leapfrogged the trust earning
thing by by releasing the bags,
[SPEAKER_19]: being transparent and just teaching people
something that they didn't know before
[SPEAKER_19]: that was so sort of mind altering and life
altering.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like not only are you now no longer
throwing your trim away, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: of course, years would go by and we'd get
to crops being grown specifically just for
[SPEAKER_19]: hash making.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it created this incredible community
where I just suddenly knew everywhere in
[SPEAKER_19]: the world where the best hash was like I
was the conduit for that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I knew I know where all the best hash in
the world is from all of these incredible
[SPEAKER_19]: people ordering bubble bags over the years
and just and just making hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's that's been my journey.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's been an honor to walk these steps
and just travel around the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: Johnny Appleseed style, but Johnny Johnny
hash pipe style, just making hash and
[SPEAKER_19]: showing people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Reagan would come into Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would people like Uroy and Ajaman.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing they would do when they
landed would give me a call and I'd whip
[SPEAKER_04]: over and give giant handfuls of skunk
number one to every one of the band
[SPEAKER_04]: members and seeds to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had really a lot of bird at that
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did not.
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I incorrect to say that Joseph Culture
Hill was like in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe you guys were hanging out and then
he drove to Germany and passed away like
[SPEAKER_19]: the next day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably the one I was closest to,
I had known actually Ajaman's crew longer,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Uroy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uroy was very, very special and close to
us.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'll tell you, I have a few songs
with my name in it from all pretty much
[SPEAKER_19]: reggae artists.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's Richie Spice wrote one called
Dabin.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's that mentions me a few times in
there about vaporizing some full mount
[SPEAKER_19]: with them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Luton Fire did one called Sweet Trichome.
[SPEAKER_19]: John Mason did one called.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, what was his called?
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't even remember all that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's about five or six of them
now, so I don't have hundreds,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I'm still working on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, don't forget on Hash Church,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a classic song.
[SPEAKER_19]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I mean, Marcus, you you earn my
trust like almost immediately and thinking
[SPEAKER_20]: about that because.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then summer 90 like that whole summer
99 after I heard that that year had gotten
[SPEAKER_20]: the bags, really, I think.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't when did you put the bags out,
December of 99 or spring of that?
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was March.
[SPEAKER_20]: So March.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I remember I remember 99.
[SPEAKER_20]: I went a lot with like these fucked up wet
balls of hash, basically like wrong,
[SPEAKER_20]: like just wrong.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was like bubble hash, you know,
trying to move, you know, move,
[SPEAKER_20]: move and shake.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was my fault.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I mean, it was it was our
everyone can't put it on you, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I saw I sold you the bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: I sold you the bags and then showed you
how to dry it incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_20]: You did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, well, I kept I remember I kept
on like I can own it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I remember hitting you up one time.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I remember I used snow.
[SPEAKER_20]: I like washed it with snow and you're
like, dude, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_20]: All the track comes and you get stuck in
it.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I was like just trying,
you know, it's called out after I'd gone
[SPEAKER_20]: through the the first few months of having
it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it took a while, man, to really get
it, you know, again, no one to talk to.
[SPEAKER_20]: To accept, you know, a message that you
would send and hopefully you'd be on
[SPEAKER_20]: Overgrow and answer it through PM,
you know, free DM, which is funny to say.
[SPEAKER_20]: When the word DM came out, I was like,
what is DM?
[SPEAKER_20]: What happened to PM private message?
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's, you know, the journey of that.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I remember utilizing that that and
going to on tour with it with my
[SPEAKER_20]: girlfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, it was it was an
interesting time and I think everyone's
[SPEAKER_20]: lives at that point in that band's career
and our own lives.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it was mainly, you know,
there was some hash, but it was it was
[SPEAKER_20]: very few and far between.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it wasn't very good when you found it.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was usually imported.
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think, Mark, you know,
the timeline is maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_20]: Into the 2000s, when the bubble hash
really hit, because I don't I think maybe
[SPEAKER_20]: 2000, 2001, 2003.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really when it started to really blow
through the lot down, shakedown and stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then from there, it just grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the hash that I made was 1988.
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Sam, with that said, like,
were you were you how what screens were
[SPEAKER_20]: you using?
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I'm always curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Screens we would we would get drive by.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd wash it once or twice to get rid
of the the floating crap and make the
[SPEAKER_04]: water cleaner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you treated it like water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the yield wasn't quite as good as with
multiple bag system like Marcus came up
[SPEAKER_04]: with a decade later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it it absolutely did work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be honest, I didn't make a whole
lot of it because even though the yield of
[SPEAKER_04]: dry shift was much lower, I preferred dry
shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it was the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what I made.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that makes sense, because the one
thing I was hanging out with Mojave and
[SPEAKER_20]: Rob Clark and one thing he said that you
would always say is that gold sinks and
[SPEAKER_20]: shit floats.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just thought it was the funniest
thing that we were just like sitting
[SPEAKER_20]: there.
[SPEAKER_20]: He just says that all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like, that's really funny.
[SPEAKER_20]: You say that.
[SPEAKER_20]: But how would you get to that?
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you just you just saying what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_20]: Made it all make sense to me because
you're using jars and the gold would sink
[SPEAKER_20]: and the shit would float.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob took a lot of pictures of the
processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it was actually showed to me in
1988 by Neville at Cannabis Castle and
[SPEAKER_04]: some American guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think his name was Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't actually remember at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had showed him and a week later,
me and Rob went over and visited Neville
[SPEAKER_04]: and he showed us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't do it a whole super lot
because I like dry shift better.
[SPEAKER_20]: Was that because of the the turf
preservation?
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, because when it gets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invented static tech and I could clean
up dry shift to ninety nine point nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the yield was incredibly low.
[SPEAKER_20]: But got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you make water hash, depending on the
variety you're using, you will lose some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the turps, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why the water smells so
turpy.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And did it matter that the yield was so
low when you had access to a fair bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, I never, never, never,
never ran out of herbal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I had trust me, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw the wall of 55 gallon barrel drums,
blue ones filled.
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the bubble bags go, I was
thinking about, you know, rejogging my
[SPEAKER_17]: memory.
[SPEAKER_17]: These were the first bags that I got.
[SPEAKER_17]: I dug up a old picture for you,
but I got my local hydro stores in Vermont
[SPEAKER_17]: to order these from you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably in 2005 or 2006.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I was my early hash making job with
your bubble bags right here back in the
[SPEAKER_17]: day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then my buddy and I, who were my other
buddy, was really more passionate about
[SPEAKER_17]: hash than I was.
[SPEAKER_17]: And he made us a custom press and brought
some gold leaf.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we just, you know, would would take
some nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also messed up drying it the first
couple of times, but we were smart enough
[SPEAKER_17]: to put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_17]: But so that's that's how long I've been
going back with those bags would be
[SPEAKER_17]: probably 2006.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's early days, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's very early days.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's only, you know, six or seven years
in.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it did take really realistically,
like around three, three and a bit to pop
[SPEAKER_19]: and take off.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: When did the eight bag kit come in?
[SPEAKER_20]: Like around 2005?
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I think he had a six or a seven there.
[SPEAKER_19]: He just said seven.
[SPEAKER_17]: It said made in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it took over a year to convince my
local hydro store owner to get it because
[SPEAKER_17]: they were so bugged out to even order
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, like that was it was different
times.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it really was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It changed the world, Marcus, because most
people weren't using my dry set method
[SPEAKER_04]: even though I publicized it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kazam's got to go to work, Sam.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just give me one second because I'm just
going to say goodbye and then you can
[SPEAKER_19]: finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I could be rude to just cut out like
that, you know, so it's nice meeting
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that I have to leave this
important conversation right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I can't I can't process all that I'm
hearing right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm talking to some legends right now,
you know, so it's really it's really great
[SPEAKER_07]: to invite me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bubble man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really looking forward to linking with
each and every one of you and see how best
[SPEAKER_07]: I can learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And grow my grow the best thing in Jamaica
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's really great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, for me, I started music by
climbing trees and smoking ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my inspiration.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I started smoking herbs and to a
group called Orthodox Music, there are a
[SPEAKER_07]: group in an organization in 12 tribes of
Israel in Jamaica here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So growing up in a rasta family,
growing up with herbs every day,
[SPEAKER_07]: 24-7 a yard in a space, it was only
evident that, you know, I ended up started
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started smoking herb, as I said,
climbing the ackee trees and finding
[SPEAKER_07]: inspiration.
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually I started to write notes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which turned out to be music.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is how my journey started 21 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: 22 years ago, musically.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the herbal music has never I've
never departed since.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, I'm just impressed with your pre
work joint.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like he's on his way to work right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold up your fatty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have three more, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are for my wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are for Lorraine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, it's really nice linking you
guys and it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hoping to link up soon again.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, I got to go to make that paper
version.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your good work.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll talk soon Kazam.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye-bye Lorraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessings everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have my respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One leaves and one comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Nick Riley here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want the best?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be fire in and fire out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome Nick.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are you at Nick?
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I am in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in outside Soho.
[SPEAKER_16]: Or Redway in Soham.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Humboldt representing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just off grid in the mountains here.
[SPEAKER_16]: So.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what's up with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, give us a little introduction to
you, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: For the people who are watching that might
not know you or what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm sure no one does know me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm my name's Nick.
[SPEAKER_16]: I run media and marketing and a million
other hats for reggae on the road.
[SPEAKER_16]: The river.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I work with the Mateel Community
Center, who's the nonprofit that puts
[SPEAKER_16]: reggae on the river on.
[SPEAKER_16]: My wife is actually vice president of the
board.
[SPEAKER_16]: My partner on the farm is also on the
board.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm involved in growing weed and
cannabis on every level you could think
[SPEAKER_16]: of.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, we just as a community,
Mateel Community Center has kind of been
[SPEAKER_16]: like the the beacon of both music and
cannabis culture, honestly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And reggae on the river was always that
pinnacle.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so for me, it was, you know,
kind of coming in.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm from Cleveland, Ohio, originally moved
out to Humboldt like 13 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just I didn't plan on staying.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it sucked me in.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the cannabis was great.
[SPEAKER_16]: But really what sucked me in was the
culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I come from kind of like an
underground punk rock anarchist world.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, the hippies that I knew in
the city were totally different.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I came out here and it was like,
oh, wow, this is this is a world I can
[SPEAKER_16]: get, you know, into and really kind of
live in.
[SPEAKER_16]: And after a couple of years, just realized
like, you know, the Mateel is kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: everything I've ever been looking for.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so my wife and I just dived head in.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been trying to help keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I hate that kind of story of
like, oh, this thing's dying.
[SPEAKER_16]: Got to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that really is what we're dealing with
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then through that, you know,
spend a couple of years trying to bring
[SPEAKER_16]: back Reggae on the River with some of the
key people that originally did it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some new blood, a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: And last year, by the skin of our teeth,
we did it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, it's all about how to keep that
tradition going, I guess.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm more here representing the Mateel
and Reggae on the River for the little bit
[SPEAKER_16]: that I can.
[SPEAKER_16]: But to me, it's more about, you know,
the homage to that legacy that I didn't
[SPEAKER_16]: have a part of.
[SPEAKER_16]: But now I'm so blessed.
[SPEAKER_16]: To be able to continue.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Nick, I just wanted to say big ups
and appreciate what you do for the Mateel.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got a property east of Garberville.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not currently a full-time Humboldt
resident, but I get up there when I can.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's, you know, a big part of my
heart in that community.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I understand the challenges.
[SPEAKER_17]: Haven't met you before, but would love to
find ways to support, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: when and where I can.
[SPEAKER_17]: I work with Chris and Redwood Roots and a
lot of those guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know Chris.
[SPEAKER_17]: My neighborhood is the Palo Verde,
you know, New Harris Island Mountain is
[SPEAKER_17]: where my spot is, which has a lot of old
history in Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: Same.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, right back.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're rebel grown, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So actually, I just remember you were my
favorite person in Booth to talk to at
[SPEAKER_16]: the, I can't even remember if it was the
Golden Tarp Awards or not.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was some real early Mateel,
early thing that happened.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I came down out of the
hills.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I used to work for an old timer who
was super paranoid.
[SPEAKER_16]: So to me, even going to the Mateel and
seeing stuff like out on tables,
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's funny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just found one of your little burlap
sacks that you had your seeds in,
[SPEAKER_16]: the rebel grown on the floor of my house,
like three days ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice to meet you this way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me know if you're back in town.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to catch up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never been myself, but I've been to
some of the big ones in Jamaica and it's
[SPEAKER_19]: just magical vibes.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's definitely worth keeping that alive
and keeping it going.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's too bad you just missed Kazam.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was going, I kind of wanted to be like,
just come to Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: He can link you up with an enormous amount
of people, artists from that kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: younger.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you were familiar with
this guy, Joe.
[SPEAKER_19]: He passed away some years ago,
but he was, if you ever, I mean,
[SPEAKER_19]: anyone that listens to Reggae,
if you've ever heard them say Ja Ova Evil,
[SPEAKER_19]: which Kronix was quite well-known for,
but Prodigy said it and Kabaka said it and
[SPEAKER_19]: kind of all these different artists that
were a part of this uprising through Joe,
[SPEAKER_19]: Lickle Joe is what they call them.
[SPEAKER_19]: He ended up having a brain aneurysm and
passing away.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they pay homage to him in the songs
through Ja Ova Evil, which is J-O-E,
[SPEAKER_19]: which is his name.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, I wish I could put my video onto
the screen.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I can, but there'd be no sound,
but this right here, it's called Ja Ova
[SPEAKER_19]: Evil part one and that's Kazam in the Tam
on the right with the green, gold and red
[SPEAKER_19]: shirt playing the acoustic guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's Makai Shaman next to him.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Hempris Sativa is there and Joe's
brothers in the blue shirt way over on the
[SPEAKER_19]: left.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just came and performed for me and my
buddy one year when we were working for an
[SPEAKER_19]: online YouTube platform that monetized
views and man, what an experience,
[SPEAKER_19]: dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I can't, I probably have 150 studio
phone numbers for Kingston and at least
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe 200 artists from like the old school
roots guys to like from Luciano and,
[SPEAKER_19]: and Tony rebel and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and you know, Israel vibes and all
these guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then all the way back to like the
chronic says and the Kabaka is,
[SPEAKER_19]: and I've just had a huge passion for
reggae music, a big part of my life.
[SPEAKER_19]: Although funny enough, you know,
for me, it started with rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_19]: My dad gave me the old Beatles and stones
albums and CCR.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was just like, this is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it kind of went into punk rock
for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I was a skateboarder and I was
living in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_19]: This kind of pretty, pretty awesome shit
hole that, uh, you know, a shit hole sucks
[SPEAKER_19]: if you don't make best of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you're living in a shit hole,
like I guess kind of out of rock,
[SPEAKER_16]: Cleveland's kind of a shit hole too.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Winnipeg is very familiar, very
similar.
[SPEAKER_19]: We just had all the great bands.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so just like Cleveland prior to the
punk rock bands, we had all the metal
[SPEAKER_19]: bands.
[SPEAKER_19]: So first I saw all the metal bands,
you know, from glam rock kisses to like
[SPEAKER_19]: hardcore Sabbath and just the,
the real, the real rootsy metal shit,
[SPEAKER_19]: even like venom and like, you know,
some, some, some obviously slayer that
[SPEAKER_19]: kind of turned into punk rock.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had this dive bar called the Albert
that just had like every punk rock band,
[SPEAKER_19]: every punk rock band.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like they were all just there and I was
buying vinyl at the time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I still have all these punk rock
records on vinyl.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that kind of grew for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how it happened.
[SPEAKER_19]: It must've been psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_19]: It must've been psychedelics because
somehow for me, and I don't think I'm
[SPEAKER_19]: missing anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went from punk rock back into that sort
of old school sixties psychedelic rock,
[SPEAKER_19]: and then the Grateful Dead and Phish.
[SPEAKER_19]: And once the Grateful Dead and Phish,
although I will say in that time that I
[SPEAKER_19]: was getting into the Grateful Dead and
Phish, Reggae was like at that,
[SPEAKER_19]: like I was listening to Peter Tosh like a
crack head.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I would just listen to Peter Tosh and
he had so many albums.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just like pounding Peter Tosh
religiously into my head.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, and then really jam bands,
jam bands, Reggae.
[SPEAKER_19]: And now I'm more eclectic from hip hop.
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously there was hip hop in there a bit
too in 95 when Biggie and Tupac were kind
[SPEAKER_19]: of taken off in the woo and you know,
obviously KRS1 and some of the classics
[SPEAKER_19]: that I liked.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I feel like I'm pretty eclectic in my
music.
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess if there's any genre I've
certainly paid attention to world music.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was a huge Fela Anikulapo Kuti fan.
[SPEAKER_19]: Massive Fela fan, listened to so much of
that music for so long with Egypt 80 and
[SPEAKER_19]: all his other different iterations.
[SPEAKER_19]: Even his son, Femi Kuti, I got to meet and
hang out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, his son is incredible, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw him in Central.
[SPEAKER_20]: Same energy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I never got to see Fela,
but Femi I've seen many times.
[SPEAKER_19]: His energy was incredible, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they speak French.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm bilingual being a good old
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was able to meet them in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_19]: There was really not a lot of people at
the show that were speaking French funny
[SPEAKER_19]: enough, but I could.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they spent lots of time hanging out
with me.
[SPEAKER_19]: So always happy to spend time with
musicians who are so exceptional at the
[SPEAKER_19]: execution of their vision or tapping into
this just incredible, I guess,
[SPEAKER_19]: as Dan would say, amplifier.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, he was calling cannabis an
amplifier, but music too can be amplified
[SPEAKER_19]: as we know.
[SPEAKER_19]: From Bob Dylan, I guess it was what,
1965 or 67.
[SPEAKER_19]: What year did Bob Dylan do his?
[SPEAKER_19]: Newport?
[SPEAKER_19]: Or even, yeah, Newport.
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it early?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think it was 65.
[SPEAKER_19]: 65, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was a big thing when he just like,
I think he was getting booed there,
[SPEAKER_19]: wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_19]: When he came out with the electric guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: It goes to show you how much humans fear
change, because I bet you 99% of the
[SPEAKER_19]: people that booed at Dylan when he came
out with the electric guitar at Newport,
[SPEAKER_19]: are huge electric guitar fans today if
they're still alive.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, new is scary.
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything happened to Miles, man?
[SPEAKER_20]: When you made Bitches Brew, they were
like, what are you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_20]: And you changed the world.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I had a conversation last night
where they're like, Miles is underrated.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, actually, he created drum
loops.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm not quite sure I'm on board with
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, he just doesn't give a fuck
about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the West Coast, it was the Monterey Pop
Festival.
Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Was that the most important open air
festival in California, Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, yes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because I remember listening to
Hendrix or studying Hendrix as a young
[SPEAKER_20]: musician.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that performance always came up
because of him lighting his guitar and all
[SPEAKER_20]: the stuff, all the synthesizers.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that happened during that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And no one had ever seen that.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: He was definitely influenced.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was thinking about that, where he was
definitely influenced by The Who and
[SPEAKER_20]: others like that, because they were
already doing crazy stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then he was like, what am I going to
do to up this?
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's like, I'm going to lay my shit on
fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was decent.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, just kind of good.
[SPEAKER_19]: He inspired some people.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember seeing Dweezil Zappa and him
telling the story of finding bits and
[SPEAKER_19]: pieces of a guitar under his dad's stairs.
[SPEAKER_19]: And his dad being like, oh, that was
Jimmy's.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the one he burnt at the Monterey
Pop Festival.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I think he restored it.
[SPEAKER_19]: He might have even been playing it the
night that he told the story.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't imagine why he would tell the
story if he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dweezil Zappa definitely has that guitar,
though, the one that Jimmy set on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frank was a one block away neighbor of
mine in Lowell Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: His babysitter was Miss Christine,
who was kind of a girlfriend of mine at
[SPEAKER_04]: the time.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Skunk Man Sam history.
[SPEAKER_19]: Frank's a block away.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Hayes brothers are even closer.
[SPEAKER_19]: Frank's probably telling his band,
stay the fuck away from those Hayes
[SPEAKER_19]: brothers and that skunk guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it true?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't run into the Hayes when I was
living in Lowell Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a different time.
[SPEAKER_20]: Not Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, hold on.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sam, can I ask you a really important
question?
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that scene, that music scene,
Lowell Canyon scene at the time you were
[SPEAKER_20]: there, was the most important music scene
in the world.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the center of pretty much most of
the greatest songs being written.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the center of the Jefferson
Airplane and the Big Brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was other important areas,
too.
[SPEAKER_20]: True.
[SPEAKER_20]: At least it felt like Fleetwood Mac and
the beach.
[SPEAKER_20]: So much American history has been written
in that canyon.
[SPEAKER_20]: For me, at least, as a nerd about music
historical moments, I look at that as a
[SPEAKER_20]: very unique time.
[SPEAKER_20]: Almost like the Lower East Side and the
mid to late 60s kind of had its own
[SPEAKER_20]: vision, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're within five miles of the current
fire line of the Palisades Fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: Palisades Fire is right on Mandeville
Canyon, which is just above Grimwood,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is just above Mahalan.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mahalan, actually, the old Mahalan Road is
the current boundary of the upper level of
[SPEAKER_11]: that fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that fire is getting up, going north
towards Encino, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_20]: I have two friends that are... I had a
bandmate that actually Marcus met in
[SPEAKER_20]: Amsterdam, Ross.
[SPEAKER_20]: He lost his whole home.
[SPEAKER_20]: He lost his studio, his music equipment,
all his memories.
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything is just gone.
[SPEAKER_20]: He sent me an image and it's nine blocks
this way, nine blocks that way.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just gone.
[SPEAKER_20]: For those that are out there that can
help, just to say this really fast to
[SPEAKER_20]: everybody, please help.
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't go into a corny narrative about
politics that's corny, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_20]: Go help people.
[SPEAKER_20]: Talk about all that later.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just go help.
[SPEAKER_20]: Be actionable because right now is the
time.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have N95 masks, please ship them
out to people.
[SPEAKER_20]: Please help because they don't they're
breathing in super toxic, very toxic air.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's another issue that will be later in
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good example was two houses away from
Frank Zappa's house was Joni Mitchell's
[SPEAKER_04]: house.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, welcome to Morning Glory,
who just popped in.
[SPEAKER_19]: Looks like he's enjoying some outdoor
action, getting the fresh air.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are you from, brother?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_20]: It has this East Coast look to it with
those trees poking out your back left side
[SPEAKER_20]: over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here in Mendocino County in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I jumped in at a pretty sensitive time
talking about the fires, because actually
[SPEAKER_15]: in 2020, I myself became victim to the oak
fire and I actually lost everything.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry to hear about that.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, firsthand.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what it what it means.
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, you know, it really is.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm hoping and I'm hoping they can
contain the fire.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's at 11 percent or I think 11 percent.
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe someone can correct me if I'm
wrong here.
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's not looking great.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah, it's not for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I write a river story?
[SPEAKER_13]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in 2008, I moved to Santa Cruz next to
a green room on Beech Hill and my
[SPEAKER_13]: roommates at the time were the moon germs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So kind of punk rock, surf rock,
it kind of ties in all this bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_13]: everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were like, I was 18, didn't know
anyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually took a musician's room because
he went all on tour and like now I'm
[SPEAKER_13]: living in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they take me to this band practice in
Monterey.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a Monterey Pops there and they
jam hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm trying to keep up with all these
college kids.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm 18.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm I'm puffing tough and and fall
asleep on the couch.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wake up and they're dumping black
and yellow bins.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said, it's time to chop your way
to the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the whole the whole house was
trimming weed in Monterey and we would get
[SPEAKER_13]: some of the trim and make hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's how we like built our studio,
our little jam shack.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our first records were paid for from
crops.
[SPEAKER_13]: Later on, I started Ancestree,
which is a Santa Cruz roots band.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Nick, it's a pleasure to to meet you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And our goal was to tour a circuit from
Seattle to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would chop our way to the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all funded from cannabis and we
would make the hash and sell that at
[SPEAKER_13]: shows.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one cool thing about weed and music is
it was the growers in Oregon and NorCal
[SPEAKER_13]: that would take us in.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would play a show like the Jolly Roger
or something, some, you know, dive and we
[SPEAKER_13]: had nowhere to stay.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were sleeping in a little LAX short bus
and there's 11 of us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was always like a grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some iry head would be like, you know,
where do you guys stay?
[SPEAKER_13]: And like we had no idea, like in our car,
you know, in the bus.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's another cool thing is not
not only was it the amplifier,
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis was like the the muse,
but it was the cannabis community that
[SPEAKER_13]: always took in players and bands and acts,
in my experience, as a performing touring
[SPEAKER_13]: musician from Seattle to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always got love.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's something that I think,
you know, times have changed when it comes
[SPEAKER_13]: to like, you know, depending on a crop to
pay for an album or a tour.
[SPEAKER_13]: But hey, it really was the foundation that
that that built our group Ancestree.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of our ways, one of the stops on
the way was Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_13]: Circa like 2010, 2012.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 2010, 2014.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was our circuit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: You nailed something, though, like just
being a musician and stuff myself.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, whatever.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the traveling around in a van with
like some level of like weed or I used to
[SPEAKER_16]: ship finger hash back to myself and hide
it in the, you know, guitar pedals.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that would be like smoking out of an
apple on the back of the van.
[SPEAKER_16]: But you nailed it every single time,
no matter where you were, if it was like a
[SPEAKER_16]: shitty ass sports bar we ended up at,
if it was like the randomest, hardcore,
[SPEAKER_16]: crusty house, whoever was smoking weed,
they were always it was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_16]: let's huddle up.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's the head.
[SPEAKER_16]: Always be like, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, you guys hungry?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, you guys want to go get some food?
[SPEAKER_16]: You need a place to crack every single
time.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was always the stoner.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that just crossed every single
boundary, which actually is kind of like
[SPEAKER_16]: what you were saying, Mark.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like every type of music you just
described.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're like, oh, it's all over.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's eclectic.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all weed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like that's the one kind of like,
you know, it it really is like and out
[SPEAKER_16]: here in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_16]: First thing I realized when I moved,
that was all the hills, too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like, if you can imagine a type of
person into a type of music, smoking a
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of weed, they had their own little
hill or like part of a hill or like they'd
[SPEAKER_16]: bring their little crew up and that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And and everyone still had that one common
denominator.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, oh, man, everyone's so
different around here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, weed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're traveling in a van and just being
out there with that as the common
[SPEAKER_16]: denominator.
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't agree with you more,
man.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just touched my heart on that one.
[SPEAKER_16]: So and yeah, come back up to reggae on the
river.
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hey, you know.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll do it, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, imagine the level of kindness you
got to have to be like, oh, how many are
[SPEAKER_19]: there of you?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, just like 11.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah, no problem, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Come come hang out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got like a studio apartment just above
the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_19]: We should be able to fit if we all lay
head to toe, head to toe.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was an anarchist collective in
Missoula, Missoula, Montana.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some punk group led us in just to a co-op.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't tell you how many like punk
anarchist co-ops we as like Cresty,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, Santa Cruz heads would come
through and it was all weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: We came through with that bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were chopping our way to the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: And but it was also just that the
compassion, you know, head nose ahead by
[SPEAKER_13]: the look of the eye.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, you see some OK,
and you're like, OK, let's let's go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go hang out with them and contribute
to the circle.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it always works out.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always had a place to stay even in the
cold, wet places.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was always it was always important
piece to to keep the music in the weed
[SPEAKER_13]: together.
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, back then, bubble hash was like
this, like elevated version of kind,
[SPEAKER_19]: but it opened all locked doors if there
was a puffer on the other side.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, well, it's like your story actually
reminds me of like when I'm we I met
[SPEAKER_20]: Marcus in Amsterdam with my band when we
just got off tour and we just went there
[SPEAKER_20]: by chance to just like they're like,
what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_20]: Go to like Belgium or France?
[SPEAKER_20]: Or I was like, let's go to Amsterdam and
go so I can hang.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're like, all right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I get there and I walk into this
shop and I see see the bubble bags on the
[SPEAKER_20]: wall.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like, oh, dude, that's my friend's
bags.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the guy literally goes, oh,
yeah, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_20]: He calls Marcus on his phone and he's
like, hands me the phone to like test if I
[SPEAKER_20]: actually knew Marcus.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, Marcus, it's lemon cake.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's like, dude, he's like, come to this
address.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we all end up rolling over there.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we had an incredible time.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like that was an Adam's place.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wasn't that it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Weren't you in Amsterdam at Hempworks?
[SPEAKER_20]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I was at Adams.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was like I want works.
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw this.
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw your stuff in the window.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, oh, my God, I'm going in like
I went in.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was I was like, dude, I just I felt
connected.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, oh, it's connected here.
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, my you know, and then we ended
up meeting you and then meeting Sama.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we were asked to play the
showcase with Cyprus and all that Cyprus
[SPEAKER_20]: Hill and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we ended up opening up for all them.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was Doug Adams partner Adam
Dunn from TH seeds that him and Doug had a
[SPEAKER_19]: place called Hempworks.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was Doug that called me.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I remember it was like it was.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it was definitely Doug.
[SPEAKER_20]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the best day when you're actually
like I remember being backstage at a
[SPEAKER_19]: string cheese incident concert once.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this dude was dropping a name to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, oh, yeah, I know the bubble
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_19]: And he said, yeah, that hash guy and it no
one first of all, nobody like I'm not a
[SPEAKER_19]: person like my my I have a very like a
very small niche of people know looking
[SPEAKER_09]: into his eyes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he's looking right at me.
[SPEAKER_19]: In the end, he did know my friend Kyle who
helped me with one of my earlier logos.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was kind of an an honest mistake
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: But hey, I wanted to welcome Mendo Dopes
in the house.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just saw him pop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up, my brother?
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.
[SPEAKER_19]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_19]: Doing it, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Brother.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stories.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone's like everywhere right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: My bottom row is awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Got Mendo Dope in the car.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kazam Davis in the middle.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's in the car on his way to work.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smoking fat and then Morning Glory is my
bottom left corner.
[SPEAKER_19]: So right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many people are in here right now?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, there's 12 of us.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think on a phone you have to like swipe
to another page.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think on a phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, I'm on my laptop.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you're on your laptop in the corner
and I can go down and up and down through
[SPEAKER_12]: this list of people.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can also go up to the top right.
[SPEAKER_19]: It should say view.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can go to like gallery if you want
to see everyone at once or you can go to
[SPEAKER_19]: speaker and then only the one person.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see 12.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a double stack in here.
[SPEAKER_19]: But how stoned are you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_19]: Me?
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you talking to me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I'm sitting here smoking my.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a demonstration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a demonstration.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to.
[SPEAKER_19]: A skunk man Sam demonstration.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's focusing hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Focus, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the focus.
[SPEAKER_20]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, did you know that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you know that, DJ Hart, before you
said that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave Hitto one of those several years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, so check it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think every important relationship that
I've ever made in my life has come from
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about I've smoked weed
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about when they started
legalizing it state by state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to jump on the plane and just fly
it like that's my vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even DJ that the first annual Cannabis
Cup, the first, second and third high
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: The annual Cannabis Cup in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm going to tell you something.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as, you know, hash, I hit hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to roll up myself personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the Kelly weed is the
strongest weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Texas, so I think that the Kelly
weed is very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Oregon, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oklahoma, I damn sure don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Michigan.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fuck with Michigan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan is very, very underrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those Caldeans up there, those are like
Arab Christians.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know how you have Arab Muslims.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got Arab Christians.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they call themselves Caldeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those Caldean people up there,
they grow some good damn weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about Snoop Doggy Dog style
weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: That weed, believe it or not, is all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes if you're just looking for
the weed itself, it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you if you hunt the hash and you
find the six star full melt, like you,
[SPEAKER_19]: you just found the weed you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_20]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, peace, everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to roll.
[SPEAKER_20]: Marcus, I'll be back next week.
[SPEAKER_20]: Full force, people.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for including me.
[SPEAKER_20]: Travel's calling wonderful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Really lovely to talk with everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love all of you very much.
[SPEAKER_20]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_20]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_20]: Peace, everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, dude, Dan, we'll link.
[SPEAKER_20]: Peace, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try some Vermont weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that with that Vermont weed you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan knows.
[SPEAKER_17]: So here in front of me, you know,
I've got this is the California version.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I've got the Vermont version here
and I got them both rolled up.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've been smoking back and forth.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the California.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the Vermont.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I've got some indoor too.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, you know, it really depends,
in my opinion, on how it's stored.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's things about my California weed
that I like better that I think it has a
[SPEAKER_17]: deeper flavor.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's probably a bit stronger in
certain ways.
[SPEAKER_17]: The Vermont weed is easier to preserve the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's really terpy and it's easier to
keep it fresh, I think.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I like both.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you prefer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you had a preference, would it be
the California or would it be the Vermont?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm in love with growing weed in both of
these places.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't make him choose.
[SPEAKER_17]: Callie Callie.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I will say is that Humboldt County
in the Apple Triangle is probably the
[SPEAKER_17]: ultimate in terms of potential climate,
history, culture.
[SPEAKER_17]: If someone put a gun to my head and said
you could only grow weed in Humboldt or
[SPEAKER_17]: Vermont, I'd probably go back to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know, very tough call.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you been up to the Kootenays?
[SPEAKER_19]: In Canada?
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_19]: You should come check out the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like 99 percent sure it was like Draft
Dodgers from Humboldt who bounced to the
[SPEAKER_19]: Kootenays and started the culture there.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's very much like our version of of
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's it's big.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's forested and it's just like maniac
fucking characters living on acreages just
[SPEAKER_19]: everywhere growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where Black Bear was living?
[SPEAKER_19]: Black Bear was actually in the Okanagan.
[SPEAKER_19]: He wasn't quite, but he would have like he
would have been the king of the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck, he would have been the king of
Humboldt for that matter.
[SPEAKER_19]: That guy was quite a character.
[SPEAKER_17]: So my first year in Humboldt, the farm
that I was at, had a bunch of Vancouver
[SPEAKER_17]: Island purple crosses and a bunch of
Kootenay crosses.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we actually had a bunch of,
you know, Vancouver Island early finishing
[SPEAKER_17]: purples crossed into some like old school
neighborhood northern lights crosses.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was actually the first stuff I
grew in California was, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: Canadian, you know, stuff and did great.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: That wasn't from legends, was it?
[SPEAKER_17]: It was some people who had come and worked
on farms and they brought genitals with
[SPEAKER_17]: them that they had been working on in the
Kootenays and in Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then those just made a impact.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's like they were living in
the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_17]: And brought genetics and combined them
with the old school neighborhood stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: And some people still had it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll cut you off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some intros from our two newest
guests here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lizzie from Mendo Dope and also Mourning
Glory, our Mendocino representatives
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning, Glory.
[SPEAKER_15]: Morning, brother.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I'll start it off.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, lost you a moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Mourning Glory.
[SPEAKER_15]: As I mentioned, I'm here in Mendocino
County.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where to begin?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a passion for the hashing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also love to DJ on the side.
[SPEAKER_15]: And lately, starting last year,
I decided to what happens if I wanted to
[SPEAKER_15]: combine both passions, both DJing and hash
making by which honestly, I put me and a
[SPEAKER_15]: good homie of mine who's been kind of
doing this thing for a while now,
[SPEAKER_15]: put our talents together.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've been on this this little bit of
a quest this last few years, myself,
[SPEAKER_15]: I should say, along with him within this
last year of finding the right
[SPEAKER_15]: frequencies, vibrations, hurts,
and honestly, DJing and using bass as the
[SPEAKER_15]: agitation process.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to say, are you doing
that already right now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been talking about that for a
while, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the coolest thing ever to make some
Keef with some bass.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I remember some sub cool rest in
peace was was using a bass key agitated
[SPEAKER_15]: Keef.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I remember seeing that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And honestly, before I started doing hash
making, back in the day, I was I remember
[SPEAKER_15]: watching documentaries about hash making
in Morocco, in which you would see the
[SPEAKER_15]: sticks and beat sift process happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm like, all right, if they're beating
the plant material, they're using a
[SPEAKER_15]: vibration.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what happens if I as a little R&D,
what happens if I took a bunch of my
[SPEAKER_15]: grinders, put them on my subs and DJ to
see what would happen?
[SPEAKER_15]: And little six had great success.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, all right, not just dry sifting,
but what about ice water sifting?
[SPEAKER_15]: Savage.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yet it's been real positive results.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else works really good is
ultrasonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you use ultrasonics either with
alcohol, for example, you can put ground
[SPEAKER_04]: up buds and just do it for like 30,
45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you get is gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: The green doesn't come out fast enough and
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, in terms of ultrasonic,
I've been using ultrasonic as a way of
[SPEAKER_15]: cleaning the resin once it's sifted
through the microns.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'll be honest, like in terms of
cleaning that resin, I'll be real in this
[SPEAKER_15]: in this little R&D process, I have not
used a hose or a fan setting on the hose
[SPEAKER_15]: to clean the resin at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only been ultrasonics and it's been
working.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how clean does it get?
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty honestly, the market I have
[SPEAKER_04]: indeed you did.
[SPEAKER_19]: Savage.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to jump in.
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually just got back from Morocco not
that long ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what you mentioned, morning glory,
like I took note right away where everyone
[SPEAKER_16]: was talking about like who was beating the
best hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was all about what rhythm they had.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so like in the family that I was like
hanging out with, it was like the
[SPEAKER_16]: different sons all had different rhythms
and they'd all argue, no, mine's the best,
[SPEAKER_16]: mine's the best.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it'd be like, oh, listen to the
pattern and then smoke the hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was like you could tell the
difference because it was how long they
[SPEAKER_16]: did it, you know, what kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I never thought about the science behind
it as much as you.
[SPEAKER_16]: But immediately that clicked in my head is
like, ah, that's that's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_16]: Being a drummer myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only trouble with Moroccan hash is
it's all made with seeded marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Tsimshimeer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to be the best of the best of
the best.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we could talk about quality issues
there all day, I think.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the science behind like kind of the
culture of them beating was great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you would, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was out there in Casablanca for three
days and I was hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know what you do?
[SPEAKER_19]: You listen, I've had to smoke things of a
much lower caliber in my days,
[SPEAKER_19]: depending on to me, it's always what you
have.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whenever someone says, what's what's your
favorite hash?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, wow, the one that was grown like
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_19]: I less I care less about the aromatic
profile than I do care about how well has
[SPEAKER_19]: it expressed itself?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because at that point in time,
I can lean towards any flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, I love the haze.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's kind of my all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have an appreciation for fruity and
the gassy and all these different
[SPEAKER_19]: varieties, garlic and funk.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I really would choose the one that was
grown the best every time.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no flavor profile that would have
me choose something that was a little bit
[SPEAKER_19]: below something else just because I
preferred that flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how much my focus is on the
caliber, the purity and the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: My focus has always been on effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up, clear, high, speedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really like couch rock weed,
although I understand how medical users do
[SPEAKER_04]: like couch rock because of their physical
pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to cash back and it ain't because
of physical pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the full effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking of very efficacious cultivars,
congrats to Mendo Dope on the recent
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup win.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, my brother.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that Hetties is a very special
strain.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been liking for quite a few years
now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been growing more and more of it
throughout the last couple of years since
[SPEAKER_12]: we found it from the from the Reeve edge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see the story from the Emerald
Triangle thing?
[SPEAKER_12]: They did a little cartoon even about the
little story.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I was found at our homie's
garden and I was already in full flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: A homie passed away that year,
so we were going to his garden to go check
[SPEAKER_12]: out what is plants look like to help his
dad kind of put strains together because
[SPEAKER_12]: he had a lot of seed start stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's trying to pack things to sell and
what can mix together.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we found that one right there and cut
the clone.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's already, you know, deep October.
[SPEAKER_12]: So full of eight or nine weeks on the
flower of it and then slowly brought it
[SPEAKER_12]: back.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next year had a couple of clones
tested it indoors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Next year was perfect to do an outside
test.
[SPEAKER_12]: It did pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we did a big outside garden of it
at the at the farm we had with Cody.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so yeah, that one is it's just like a
straight old school gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's a little something hiding in
there, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a 90, I'd say like 95 percent
old school gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a little bit of every gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to even say which O.G.
[SPEAKER_12]: it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a it's just like a really good O
.G.
[SPEAKER_12]: of a little combo from like the best O.G.s
that we used to have, like not even ones
[SPEAKER_12]: that we ever grew.
[SPEAKER_12]: We never really got a really good O.G.
[SPEAKER_12]: to grow before.
[SPEAKER_12]: We always would get cuts from clubs and
get something that's not what we want.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're always trying to find these couple
of different O.G.s that we would get
[SPEAKER_12]: eights of, you know, and be like,
man, we could get this cut, but we never
[SPEAKER_12]: could find it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So then after finding this one,
it's like the gaseous one we've ever had,
[SPEAKER_12]: our favorite, like just cush strain in our
mother room and our selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a super, super nice strain,
just super cool and grows really bad ass.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really cool that the judges all
liked it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was funny, too, because like,
you know, gas has been a little bit on the
[SPEAKER_12]: back burner now after all the exotic candy
gas things that people are on and all of
[SPEAKER_12]: the new hype stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for it to be like catch the judges for
like a just nice, pretty close to all
[SPEAKER_12]: traditional O.G.
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of profile was really cool to see how
people like animal cut people are a little
[SPEAKER_12]: different to than other people,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're more old school and they're very
smart and they're not like a normal other
[SPEAKER_12]: cups.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like they could be tricked by
the hype stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's cool to see like people that
really took the time to like it,
[SPEAKER_12]: like to like as much as we like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Story, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very strange to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no shit together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like, well, we're going to have
to keep this forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like this isn't as we we we keep
strains probably for like we've had we had
[SPEAKER_12]: a vanilla coach strain we had for like 11
years, as long as we ever had one strain
[SPEAKER_12]: for.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that strain kind of got maybe
sick or sad or have Latin virus or
[SPEAKER_12]: something to stop growing to grow really
vigorously.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we just got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But besides that one strain, we kind of
keep strains for a few years, maybe three,
[SPEAKER_12]: four years, and then we'll we'll move on
again and kind of switch things the mother
[SPEAKER_12]: room around.
[SPEAKER_12]: And but that Heddy's strain in general
will be like a forever strain for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been crossing strains to that
now for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have all kinds of strains with that
lineage from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really cool to see new stuff that
backdates to that also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your clothes clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can keep I've had it for more than 30
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were just as good as they were 30
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I used extreme measures to keep them
clean, including not taking any new plant
[SPEAKER_04]: into my facilities until I had field
tried, tried it for six months or so.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I bet that's probably how you have
to be real serious these days with
[SPEAKER_12]: everything going on and all the strains
that have all the strains you can get that
[SPEAKER_12]: are disease ridden and whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, for our mother room our whole
life since we started keeping that vanilla
[SPEAKER_12]: strain, we kept in like 2012 or 2011 when
we first kept like mothers and that was
[SPEAKER_12]: the first clone we kept as like a forever,
like all year long, we keep it and all the
[SPEAKER_12]: next year we have it and we have it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And our mother's sex like a lot of our
mother rooms, we would just let them
[SPEAKER_12]: barely live.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like sometimes during the winter,
they're just like very dormant,
[SPEAKER_12]: like in like I forget what the word would
be right now, but it's like in limbo.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not really happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not vigorous because we don't have
a lot of space to have like vigorous
[SPEAKER_12]: plants the whole all winter and all year
and the amount of moms that we do have.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we for a long time, we keep our moms in
the winter time, really slow growing,
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'll boost them back up in the
in the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a a cold grow refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kept the temperature at four or five
degrees and you hardly had to water it at
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: No lights, fluorescence inside the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just super smart.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's it seems like keeping them in
that dormant, slow motion grow is not a
[SPEAKER_12]: problem to slow down things and be able to
maintain.
[SPEAKER_12]: But with us like we have vanilla mom,
we almost lost it like 10 different times
[SPEAKER_12]: throughout the 11 years we had it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it just it got it would get sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when Russets hit that year,
Russets hit hard out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It got Russets bad and we barely kept it
alive that year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it's like that thing went through
hell.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's like not far fetched that it
would catch something.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it probably maybe someone could have
cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we also know it was cool to have it
for as long as we had it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't need to force force.
[SPEAKER_04]: At one time I had three hundred and sixty
mothers and a few fathers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, my employees sort of rebelled
against me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I knocked it down to 120.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've had happened a lot.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had people rebel against me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Against my collections, you know,
like I've had I've had whole years where
[SPEAKER_17]: we've, you know, cloned, you know,
seven hundred fifty plants and went
[SPEAKER_17]: through multiple rounds of testing only
for someone in the winter to let stuff go
[SPEAKER_17]: without permission, because it's
challenging to manage with a you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: when you're limited with space or
electricity, especially growing off grid a
[SPEAKER_17]: lot in northern California.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I feel that for what's funny is as long
as I've been growing weed, there's such a
[SPEAKER_17]: small percentage of time that I had actual
control of a year round mom room where
[SPEAKER_17]: someone wouldn't make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and now, you know, even in
Humboldt, you know, we play musical grow
[SPEAKER_17]: rooms in the winter.
[SPEAKER_17]: We use our cloning room, which is,
you know, small.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to, you know, you know,
burn fuel, which is very wasteful to do
[SPEAKER_17]: that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we fire up the greenhouse and put a
bunch of propane in at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's it's a year round evolving thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a challenge and not efficient with
with cost or anything when you're off grid
[SPEAKER_17]: and super rural.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then here on the East Coast,
we bank all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have my stuff banked here and have a
pretty decent collection and some of the
[SPEAKER_17]: mails that we use so we can recreate not
have to re reselect.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the goal for years is I've been
trying to get my you know, my more special
[SPEAKER_17]: stuff banked with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I haven't trusted any of the tissue
culture people that exist that are
[SPEAKER_17]: offering services.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm about to do some initiations and
then, you know, keeping them clean and
[SPEAKER_17]: making sure that you have, you know,
lab testing that they're pathogen and
[SPEAKER_17]: viroid free.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's a big challenge and a big
challenge in cultivating that didn't,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, exist when you go back 15 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've I've found twenty nine different
viruses in cannabis.
And.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, whatever that vanilla kush had,
it would like the vanilla kush was always
[SPEAKER_12]: a bitch to root to.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was so hard to take longer than any
strain we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our whole life.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll always be sad by the time they're
rooted.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that that was like we would get them
to root, though.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they would grow kind of good and
veg.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we put them outside.
[SPEAKER_12]: They look happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as soon as they start to get a little
bit of a teen mode and a little bit where
[SPEAKER_12]: everything's starting to rip, that would
just be dormant and slow down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as it went to flower,
it started just dying, like yellowing out
[SPEAKER_12]: and not putting out the smallest buds
ever.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like a tricks for like two or three
years.
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought we could like save it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the mom was like, it would be good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we get clones and they'd start to look
good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were like, nice, it's maybe it's
back.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then now they just go to shit right by
the time we really need to start doing
[SPEAKER_12]: something.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I was trying to give stuff to
other people I trust.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's hard to trust people.
[SPEAKER_17]: But every year before the winter,
I'd always try to get the most important
[SPEAKER_17]: things to at least a few people.
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully, you know, if everybody made
a mistake, one person would still have it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, very smart.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's how we have our head is now
we have a couple of people with the head
[SPEAKER_12]: is because we cannot lose that fucking
strain.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had to make sure that's not on just
one person.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, even when the fires came through,
you know, a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_12]: those three years of fires straight.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was also a crazy hurdle and pain in
the ass to keep mothers going.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like very dangerous, you know,
just having one of a kind plant,
[SPEAKER_12]: one unicorn in the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we could have it somewhere like
like sometimes we have our homie now in
[SPEAKER_12]: Minnesota, have some cuts for Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold some things for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to start having him have like
a couple of various reins.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like way the fuck away from
California's fires.
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, fires would be probably the one
of the top 10 ways you could lose your
[SPEAKER_12]: fucking shit nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would grow a one or two big plants in
the ground that would be 15 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would grow maybe five of them in
like a five, 10 liter pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would grow a couple of them in
a refrigerated, a cold refrigerated with
[SPEAKER_04]: grow lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never lost one.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that's bad ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was over a 30 year period.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like with our mothers, we have we
have a big like a 60 by 40 like metal shop
[SPEAKER_12]: for the last like quite a few years now
where our grandpa's house was that we took
[SPEAKER_12]: over.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's like where our moms are in our
studio is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have our little hut for like our
our moms.
[SPEAKER_12]: We only have we keep we keep we've always
we never gone hard like you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: We keep like 30.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Maskin Robbins has always been like
something we like 31 flavors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like if we have 31, I don't know how why
we would need more.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's so fucking easy to hoard and
keep everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we would try to once we get past that,
we try to weed it back down so we can fit
[SPEAKER_12]: like our moms in the dormant state in our
little hut upstairs in the in the machine
[SPEAKER_12]: shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's fucking freezing in there,
too, like your like your fridge tech.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is how like it's been helpful for
us to not have just full time vigorous
[SPEAKER_12]: plants all year round, constantly
transplanting and keeping them fed and
[SPEAKER_12]: happy and cutting them, cutting and
cutting them.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've always done a lot smaller
gardens, too, than a lot of people
[SPEAKER_12]: throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we got raided in 2013 or whatever,
we we just started filming our personal
[SPEAKER_12]: gardens, you know, like everyone's known
like our our YouTube stuff is like it's
[SPEAKER_12]: always like six plants and 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we got raided.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got raided with the 25 because they're
too big.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then instead of just going in the
hills and teaming up with people or going
[SPEAKER_12]: and getting a property where we were just
going to blow it up, we were so focused on
[SPEAKER_12]: music.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to do music so much not
disappear.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then then that kind of made us like
get into the end subquel, made us get into
[SPEAKER_12]: filming the garden at the same time.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're filming music stuff, filming the
garden stuff at the same time.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're growing so much smaller gardens than
so many people are doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only the last couple of years we've
been doing these bigger gardens where it
[SPEAKER_12]: needs thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: And shout out to subquel.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what a what a great fucking dude,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like knew the guy for so long.
[SPEAKER_19]: Such a character, such a lover of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: A true bubble ambassador truly turned so
many people onto bubble hash and created
[SPEAKER_19]: or helped create some very well known
names in the hash world from supplying
[SPEAKER_19]: such great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you had subquel in your life,
you were like if and you were paying
[SPEAKER_19]: attention, you also had great weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: He gave me laced our game up for sure a
lot with the indoor stuff and with hash
[SPEAKER_12]: and solvent lists and clean, clean weed in
general, just like watering with just
[SPEAKER_12]: water and super soil and not liquid
feeding every single watering and all the
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff we were told, like tricked by in the
beginning of the times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he lost his place in a fire,
wasn't that right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like the 2017 fire, I think,
or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was on Hashchurch, I think,
the following week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Telling that he got out with nothing more
than his backpack, a baseball hat and like
[SPEAKER_11]: a small little bong and a small stash of
weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was talking to him while it was
happening and he was trying to get back in
[SPEAKER_19]: his truck to like this to get back to his
property.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why I invited him on to
Hashchurch the next week.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a yeah, that was shocking,
man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that just wiped out Santa Rosa,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It wiped out like a line through Santa
Rosa.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it came over the mountain right where
Stubbs House was kind of in towards the
[SPEAKER_12]: start of that fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was way up in the mountains
compared to the down low Santa Rosa area
[SPEAKER_12]: and turned over the hill, wiped his house
down almost like a fucking fire waterfall
[SPEAKER_12]: or a river or some shit straight line
through his property, through the people
[SPEAKER_12]: down him straight to the bottom of where
Santa Rosa town is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Took out like a big hotel and a couple of
other trailer parks, crossed the fucking
[SPEAKER_12]: freeway, went through a skinny
neighborhood down to this block at the end
[SPEAKER_12]: that took out the entire fucking
residential block.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was like it was a crazy, crazy fire
for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was one of the biggest ones that's ever
been out here that burnt Stubbs House
[SPEAKER_12]: down.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit was was like probably like very
similar to what's going on in LA,
[SPEAKER_12]: like full tornadoes, a fire full.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like when Stubbs would just explain
it, he said it came over the hill and
[SPEAKER_12]: exploded trees on the way down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like when it hit, the fire would come like
a waterfall, he said.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as it hit the next tree,
the tree would explode and go down to the
[SPEAKER_12]: next one.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't like the fire was a normal fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's just exploding through the
forest, just ripping down the hill,
[SPEAKER_12]: like downhill, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's not wasn't even going
uphill.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just going downhill.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fucking.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was in Santa Rosa when that one went
down and that was a crazy experience,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, because I used to stay at those
hotels on the Fountain Grove when I used
[SPEAKER_17]: to go into business.
[SPEAKER_17]: Those were like my spots.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I had actually just moved to Santa
Rosa and rented a house.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was my first night in the rental
house.
[SPEAKER_17]: And nobody knew that I was there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd moved for a business deal or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was about to move my my my family
out.
[SPEAKER_17]: They were going to be there like,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I woke up at six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to bed and I could smell smoke and
I could hear what I thought was gunshots.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was like, who'd be stupid enough to
burn a wood stove right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: with the with the wind and how dry it was.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I woke up in the morning,
I found out that what I thought was
[SPEAKER_17]: gunshots was the propane tanks exploding
in people's homes like a mile and a half
[SPEAKER_17]: down the road from where I was.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I I went to go check on my other
friend's house and set up sprinklers on
[SPEAKER_17]: people's houses in downtown Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, I mean, the ones in L.A.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think are a lot even crazier and worse.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, that's that's one of the reasons
I chose to leave California part time was
[SPEAKER_17]: like, you know, full time was because my
kids kept being exposed to so much smoke
[SPEAKER_17]: from so many fires so many weeks out of
the year.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was so intense.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's it's really unfortunate,
difficult situation for people out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sucks so bad because sub cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we we mess up through the cannabis
cups like early on, right when he was
[SPEAKER_12]: moving out of Oregon and he was finding a
place in California.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he found the Santa Rosa house and
he was so close to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was it was right as we were starting to
become like super fans of his when we met
[SPEAKER_12]: him and he moved closer to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we just clicked and he was able to
drive to our house and we could drive to
[SPEAKER_12]: his house any time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And his house was super sick and he was
just starting to grow outdoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it was like a second or third year
doing like the mental dope style outdoor
[SPEAKER_12]: at his house.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as soon as that happened, it all went
to shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like he was already going through so much
shit with his health and with Jill and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that just fucked his rest of his
life up.
[SPEAKER_12]: That fire fucked it up so bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so sad how many people have to go
through same something similar to like how
[SPEAKER_12]: sub did.
[SPEAKER_12]: But sub had so much on top of his plate
already at the fire just fucking changed
[SPEAKER_12]: his life for the like fully.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was just it was so sad because we just
going to get to see him no more.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was in Cali after that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it was gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we saw him in Arizona once.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was a super shitty.
[SPEAKER_12]: His house was really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just the seeds he had is where the
seed vault was like on his bottom
[SPEAKER_12]: downstairs of his house or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like all that shit fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: We went up there to his house like a month
or so after the fires and walked around
[SPEAKER_12]: and looked at it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we grabbed one of the stocks that was
left like they all burnt one of his trees
[SPEAKER_12]: that he had.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a nice stock we kept and we have
it in our in like our house and stuff just
[SPEAKER_12]: like for a memory.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's fucking so sad, so sad.
[SPEAKER_12]: But sub was Yeah, he had fire so long ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many Finos could have been kept as one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Name it whatever the fuck you want to
name.
[SPEAKER_12]: He probably had a lemon cherry gelato
similar variety and his fucking Fino mixes
[SPEAKER_12]: and shit he made.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I mean, he had so many cool
strains.
[SPEAKER_12]: So with the people he was working with to
like in his circle of who was making stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: with him.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll say this about sub like his
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, who grew it was fairly
important, but it seemed like it was they
[SPEAKER_19]: were somewhat more generous for some
people that maybe if you weren't had never
[SPEAKER_19]: grown full melt resin before, you might
have the best chance doing it with some of
[SPEAKER_19]: his cultivars.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were just like, everyone I ever tried
was just slammin like so good,
[SPEAKER_19]: so tasty, so strong.
[SPEAKER_19]: He always just had great hash and I listen
I go back with I don't even know what year
[SPEAKER_19]: it would have been whatever year he met
Jill because I was on like, like chat room
[SPEAKER_19]: rooms in the 90s with her Jill and this
guy Jack, they were like Jack and Jill.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what they went under.
[SPEAKER_19]: This was her original like boyfriend or
husband or whatever he was to her.
[SPEAKER_19]: Soon after Jack disappeared and then sub
popped in and that's how I met sub was
[SPEAKER_19]: through Jill.
[SPEAKER_19]: So really, I feel like I met him before he
made any I feel like we were both really
[SPEAKER_19]: working on making our marks
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, he was he was a character.
[SPEAKER_19]: He had that certain people were like,
Whoa, this guy's too much.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was just like, No, man, I'm from
Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like he's he's a perfect amount for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there would be times I was afraid
was the first dude that I remember we went
[SPEAKER_12]: to after we got ready.
[SPEAKER_12]: He took us to to a nice dinner and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a big talk about everything that
happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he would be like going to like nice
fancy restaurants and telling the waiters
[SPEAKER_12]: like he's like, you know who we are?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're cannabis celebrities.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're like famous candidate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like he was only he was like back a long
time ago, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like telling random people like I'm a
cannabis celebrity.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is who the fuck I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't know who I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, take some weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's a hat pin or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was laughing so hard like that savage
just just be that ballsy, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's so ballsy to tell people and then be
filming like you're saying to like the
[SPEAKER_12]: homie, Nick Box, who we got the head is
from.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the one who introduced us to sub
cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was following.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he was also following you,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember him talking about you years
ago, I think now that you say that he was
[SPEAKER_12]: on the forums and he was on the shit
before we ever were on YouTube and these
[SPEAKER_12]: chats that you guys were doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nick was on that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had Zach G come in.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had Mojave come in and we've yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So welcome to those two.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome, Zach.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that both you and Mojave at least
appear to be standing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for my kids put a flag
football game to start, so I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tucked off in the side of this school.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what's up on Hash Church,
waiting for a flag football to start.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is real outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's it's fricking cold and wet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's super weird to be up here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like drove out of L.A., watched all the
smoke and shit and left my family and
[SPEAKER_14]: moved into a bunch of came up here to a
bunch of rain and moisture.
[SPEAKER_14]: So hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold.
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't tell if you had a green screen
going and you were just really trying to
[SPEAKER_19]: sell that shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you had the hoodlum and the fucking to
con his valley.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo, Hayes Valley.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hayes Valley.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really good genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Green Valley Road.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know it, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's on.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about bring the Hayes back.
[SPEAKER_15]: Blue Halo.
[SPEAKER_15]: That flavor was so good.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was growing the plant garden,
that was Ryan would come through with some
[SPEAKER_13]: genetics and we put him in the land field.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of love for Hayes Valley.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had stuff in the field as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, Caleb.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Zach runs a brand out in Sacramento
called Amplified Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've gone to some shows together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know one of my favorite cultivars
from Amplified is called Cypress OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, perhaps you could share
the story of how you all got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just basically gifted around our
circle of friends that grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went by a few different names over
the years and supposedly our one buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: that got it first got it from,
I think, DJ Mugs or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we wanted to name it for the
brand, we just kind of called it Cypress
[SPEAKER_01]: OG just to give a nod to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's one of my favorite cuts still to
this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hits every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like listening to you guys
earlier about keeping moms alive for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the one that the group of
friends was always making sure somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: had alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, people called it the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it went under a few different
names over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just great effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably still my favorite thing we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that also known as that Ricky's
Brothers Kush or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure it's known as a few
things, but I can't speak to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets big when it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just a solid OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: RBK is just old school OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same cut, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all the same cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: You also remember the same cut.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so badass.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard a lot about that story and
whatever podcast I was listening to also
[SPEAKER_12]: on the first month of the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a little more info from that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've listened to Cybersilve so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's like knowing about that,
like hearing about that shit for so long.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so cool to keep a strain that long
and share it with people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for you guys, I got to get to SAC and
get some of that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a Cybersilve story that's kind of
relevant to keeping strains and all that
[SPEAKER_14]: shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: In 93, when I moved to Amsterdam,
Adam, Adam Dunn had just gotten his gotten
[SPEAKER_14]: the bubble gum seats.
[SPEAKER_14]: He had, I think, 13 phenos or so that came
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was like summer of 93.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Cybersilve just coming to town.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were just new.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they were just guys, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they're just a new band.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was Cybersilve, House of Pain and
Funk Dubious.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're doing the tour and we're hanging
out with them at Cincy Seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're doing all their promotional
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And anyway, I think it was maybe the
first, I'm not sure it was the first time
[SPEAKER_14]: we met.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was the first time we met him and
Adam had just harvested this bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he had like one plant that was yielded
really low.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it was like, and this is like
Amsterdam closet, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine a closet in Amsterdam,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, it's like the size of this
chair, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was like, these are the magic
beans from his homie back, back in back
[SPEAKER_14]: East, back in Rhode Island, who got them
from the guy and you know, the whole
[SPEAKER_14]: story.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, he pops the beans and one of them
was just like the most to this day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know everyone's got the stories of the
memories because it's a weird sense
[SPEAKER_14]: memory.
[SPEAKER_14]: But to this day, it was just one of those
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not really that we can't taste like
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like your mouth, you kept chewing and just
like while you were smoking it,
[SPEAKER_14]: it was just like, and the high wasn't that
great.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't that it wasn't that insane,
but the taste was just like nuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we went after the show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was at the Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_14]: We went back to the hotel room with with
with Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mugs wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it was just be real.
[SPEAKER_14]: And anyway, we smoked them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were blown away.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were just like, dude, I've never
tried it like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we gave them all the wheat,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like take it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gave them like the 10 of the 13 grams that
there was or something like that,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, that was left.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then so we had all those set up at
Adam's Place.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Adam's Place got robbed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone who had smelled what was going on
in town did not like what was going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they broke came in there and they
stole all the cuts and they went.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was creepy, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: They went and broke all the moms.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just snapped all their backs and left
them there like in the apartment,
[SPEAKER_14]: like walking in a crime scene,
just like a bunch of dead plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: And only one of all the moms was able to
get.
[SPEAKER_14]: Revej out of all those dead plants or
dying plants, a clone, sorry, a clone that
[SPEAKER_14]: got off of those dying plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it wasn't Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that bubblegum became the parent to
all the bubblegum of today was from that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what went to the serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what went to, you know,
saga mother and all that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the real bubblegum, the Cypress Hill
cut, which was just fucking insane,
[SPEAKER_14]: just insane.
[SPEAKER_14]: So and it was the only one that was in the
one that survived was it was bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it tastes like bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good cut.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually a good like medium version
to get a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the real the Cypress Hill cut.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a few times I've ever seen
like, you know, that kind of weird
[SPEAKER_14]: jealousy kind of thing where someone was
like, your genetics need to die like.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the weird part is like they took
them and we knew right away.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, well, you can never use it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can only breed with it because you
can't grow it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amsterdam is a small town.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't like start pulling out
bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where did you get it?
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's such a weird like history in the
cannabis genetics of how intense it can be
[SPEAKER_14]: when something new pops up and who has it
and who can have it and who's jealous and
[SPEAKER_03]: who, you know, where it is really
alignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The height is really scarcity.
[SPEAKER_19]: People start getting insecure with fear
and scarcity.
[SPEAKER_19]: They can do some silly things.
[SPEAKER_19]: I prefer loving a bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like abundance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me a happier person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an interesting I keep seeing DJ
Morning Glory there hitting his three hole
[SPEAKER_02]: hash pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm reminded of the time that I met
him at Black Oak Ranch at an event called
[SPEAKER_02]: the Kind Bud Campout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he taught me how to use
that three hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any stories about kind of
that correlation between glass and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And music and all these events that may
have seen each other at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Jamie from a heavy glass bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up in in Oregon now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a band I was playing in in the early
2000s, we used to practice in his he had a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple warehouses in think Gardena or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to rehearse there while there was
like a whole crew of people blowing tubes
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had an assembly line going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was right when like Jerome Baker
got popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden he was like the
biggest, biggest fish in the pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I think he he got rid of his
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he used to go on tour with our band
and and we never had any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he would always just make sure we had
a killer time and was just just an
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome, awesome, like inspirational dude
that just lived life his own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just total savage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was it was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember taking a guitar and burning
part of it with the with the torch from
[SPEAKER_01]: the from the glass, making that making the
tubes and still got a sick burn mark on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just those times were pretty,
pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like when things were a little more
underground, a little more closeted and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and just like just the way he ran his
whole operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a couple nondescript bands where
he'd do his runs to supply his,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, head shops and he'd book some of
it around some of our tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd always have someone fun to hang
out with at the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was that was pretty,
pretty cool scene back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody knows Jamie.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm trying to think if I do,
I think for whatever reason, always had a
[SPEAKER_19]: very strong connection to the glass
blowing world from pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say my first pipe was I want to
say 1994.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I bought a Hugh grass.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was one of us not grasses like
students.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a little Hugh grass pipe and I went
to Amsterdam that year or no the next
[SPEAKER_19]: year.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I ended up selling it because someone
apparently needed it more than I needed
[SPEAKER_19]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I ended up meeting marble slinger
before he was marble slinger at that
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was super weird because years later,
I actually met him by picking him up
[SPEAKER_19]: hitchhiking on the way to a fish show at
the gorge.
[SPEAKER_19]: But he was living in I'm, I'm guessing
close to where Dan is right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: He said he was 30 minutes from the border
if he's on the west coast anyway,
[SPEAKER_19]: because he was in Bellingham.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm close to Quebec.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Quebec.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Vermont, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so these guys all lived in
Bellingham.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: There was Marcel Braun, who's this just
incredible glassblower like top of his
[SPEAKER_19]: game.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was he was like creating and building
tools to do things that no one had done
[SPEAKER_19]: with glass yet.
[SPEAKER_19]: So he was really going down the R&D hole.
[SPEAKER_19]: Plus, he was just beyond talented savant
style.
[SPEAKER_19]: But then there was also, you know,
slinger and and Zack and Pedro smiley and
[SPEAKER_19]: D rec and Max Poland, but a little Max
Poland piece right here that sits on my
[SPEAKER_19]: side here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Jason Lee was a part of that group.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they had this huge contingency of these
glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be honest, this was really pre bubble
man pre bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: So for me, I was just chain smoking joints
like huge giant joints smoking insane
[SPEAKER_19]: amounts of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't really smoke with pipes.
[SPEAKER_19]: These guys fucking put like took buds and
like smash them into their bowl of their
[SPEAKER_19]: pipe and then just hit it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, I was intrigued.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as I met them, really, because I met
them in 98 at the gorge.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, within a year later,
I was basically going to have access to
[SPEAKER_19]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: So by the time I really befriended them
through email and whatnot, and invited
[SPEAKER_19]: them to come up, it was 45 minutes for
them to come from Bellingham right to my
[SPEAKER_19]: deck in Canada here.
[SPEAKER_19]: And literally, that house is two doors
down for me that we used to have all those
[SPEAKER_19]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_19]: But they really helped turn me on to the
glass world.
[SPEAKER_19]: The the art form of it the the awesomeness
for flower I missed the boat but for
[SPEAKER_19]: smoking hash purely like having like the
stainless steel screen with the match or
[SPEAKER_19]: even better like the beeline wick and just
like fading the flame over the hash and
[SPEAKER_19]: boiling it and even though there was no
carb cap and it was probably not the most
[SPEAKER_19]: efficient way to do things.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was still an incredible time to be
alive and be exposed to these different
[SPEAKER_19]: things.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was part of my journey, surely.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so yeah, the old full mouth bubbles.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jason had a before Jerome Baker was
Jerome Baker.
[SPEAKER_14]: He had a little spot right next to Adam's
CIA spot in Amsterdam where he would blow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a trip because I'd never seen
anyone, you know, I've never seen anyone
[SPEAKER_14]: blowing glass before, you know,
other than that, like a fair or making
[SPEAKER_14]: little trinkets and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's this kid, you know,
he's long hair, young kid, and he's over
[SPEAKER_14]: there and he's just in this old building,
like in the middle of this kind of old
[SPEAKER_14]: warehouse that looks like it's an old
like, just old ship or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: And me and Rob are puffing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, most of the balls that
you'd get pull balls you get were like
[SPEAKER_14]: graphics pull balls that were like a
serious deep angle.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're puffing bubbling hash,
you know, and we're like, dude,
[SPEAKER_14]: this just clogs the ball every time.
[SPEAKER_14]: And even to put a screen in there,
you have to fucking push it in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jason, like, yeah, he's like, oh,
how would you what do you I'm like,
[SPEAKER_14]: can you make it a little more U shaped and
a little flatter?
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's like, yeah, I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he runs over and he's like,
literally, like 20 minutes later,
[SPEAKER_14]: he comes back and gives us the ball.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we start puffing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like, what just happened?
[SPEAKER_14]: Did that just happen right now?
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a trip because, you know,
Jason Harris, everyone calls him Jerome
[SPEAKER_14]: Baker because Jerome Baker is company.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for I didn't even know for like a
couple of years that I used to sell their
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff at a shop I used to run.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I asked him one time, I was like,
why is it Jerome Baker?
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, because it's like, you know,
the glass and glass and the dead and music
[SPEAKER_14]: are just like, it wouldn't have happened.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the first glass blowing I also
saw.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I met Jay in 95 when that I believe it
was 95.
[SPEAKER_19]: But they that he had that studio and Adam
still had the CIA, because I think he
[SPEAKER_19]: closed it soon after and then opened the
KGB.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ninety four.
[SPEAKER_14]: It would have been by 95.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was open.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it was just from like mid mid
late 93 all the way through 94.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would have been it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I actually I got a role, man,
but just because it's the music thing,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give you a kind of give you a quick
story on my cannabis music relationship,
[SPEAKER_14]: please.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I grew up, you know, with a lot of
musicians around and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And music was always a part of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And obviously, cannabis and music.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I actually moved to Amsterdam to do
music.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my family friends was a guitar
player for Nina Simone, and he lived in
[SPEAKER_14]: France and he said, like, come on out and
I'll mentor you and you do music,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, learn jazz guitar.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, yeah, cool, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I basically.
[SPEAKER_14]: Came out there, got a one way ticket and
partied in Amsterdam for a few months and
[SPEAKER_14]: hitchhiked to France and like some dumb
kid with like a big bag of hash and a
[SPEAKER_14]: guitar and a backpack.
[SPEAKER_14]: I realized that my mentor had moved back
to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_14]: like four weeks earlier because we were
communicating on like postcards and
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking pay phones and shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And literally stranded in Paris with no
money and nothing but hash, which was
[SPEAKER_14]: better than money because whatever you
found people who needed hash.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I survive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got like a place to stay and food.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, and I called up Amsterdam and
called up and got Monica at Cincy Seeds on
[SPEAKER_14]: the phone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Monica is like, why don't you come
back up here?
[SPEAKER_14]: And we became a couple and we ended up
living with Monica and I started growing
[SPEAKER_14]: and breeding.
[SPEAKER_14]: And while I was in Amsterdam, this band
and I fell in love with with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, with the whole culture in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was this band that was an L.A.
[SPEAKER_14]: band that was local band playing around.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they got signed and they were doing
they needed their guitar player quit and
[SPEAKER_14]: they needed another guitar player.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, well, I play guitar
because I can't remember how I knew these
[SPEAKER_14]: guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're like, and I'm from L.A.
[SPEAKER_14]: like perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're rehearsing and starting to do
some recording.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then actually, yeah, that's they got
signed afterwards and they had like this
[SPEAKER_14]: five record deal and a tour and all this
shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're like, all right, we're going
to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start touring in Germany.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go around the world,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_14]: I I think I'm just going to stay in
Amsterdam and grow weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like it's just I couldn't feel it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like the plant was so like,
dude, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like right here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like if you can play music and be
with me, then that'll work.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you're going to go off in the
world, then we're definitely going to part
[SPEAKER_14]: ways.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because traveling in their early 90s and
cannabis was always such a challenge.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I decided just to stay with the planet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, and that band went off and
their lives went crazy and they all had
[SPEAKER_14]: all this crazy drama on their world tour.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, following your passion is
like definitely important.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for me, it was definitely sticking
with weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the age.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the age, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't couldn't was it's like part of
my part of my DNA.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Sage needed to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a junkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kid's game's about ready to start,
but I really appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, Zach.
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy the game, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have a good day, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Zach.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I seem to remember your story having a
exposure to the Grateful Dead at an early,
[SPEAKER_11]: early age, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a story there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: My my dad's best friend was the road
manager for the Grateful Dead before they
[SPEAKER_14]: were the dead.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was an old friend of Jerry's and he was
like he was more than my uncle.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was like another dad to me,
someone I grew up with my whole life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was a total character.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had lots of musicians in, you know,
in the scene in Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet we were very my dad was a smuggler
at one point.
[SPEAKER_14]: And him and his best buddy had all kinds
of strange relationships with the dead
[SPEAKER_14]: around, you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And but but yeah, it goes way back.
[SPEAKER_14]: And his family, his his kids are still
good friends.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I I never really appreciated growing
up like what that meant, like being like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, like just the Grateful Dead was
just a kind of a fixture, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: of our family, you know, Hell's Angels.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like my mom tells stories about like,
you know, Hell's Hell's Angels showing up
[SPEAKER_14]: on a dirt road and Big Sur on like
Harley's like bringing food for us
[SPEAKER_14]: because, you know, they found out that a
bunch of hippies living on this out in the
[SPEAKER_14]: woods didn't have food.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we have this weird Bay Area
connection.
[SPEAKER_14]: We live.
[SPEAKER_14]: My family lived in Moran, too,
before we moved to Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, it goes way back with the dead.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then later in life as a teenager,
when they reemerged in, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess, you know, in the 80s,
when it became a big thing, then I started
[SPEAKER_14]: going to shows again.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, by then, my uncle was no
longer involved because he got way whacked
[SPEAKER_14]: out and drugs and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: But he kind of reintroduced me to that
scene.
[SPEAKER_14]: And his kids as well got reintroduced to
the scene and started going to shows,
[SPEAKER_14]: backstage passes, going there and hanging
out with the dead in the back there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, just like a trip, just like a
little kid on acid there while the wives
[SPEAKER_14]: are making them sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just like, wow, sandwiches look
really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Could I have a sandwich?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, what the fuck are you like?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just I'm just here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got this pass and people say I can go
places.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you amazed?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you amazed like me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when you look back now, like here we
are in 2025.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just kind of like a flash in
the pan that they existed for the 30 years
[SPEAKER_11]: that they did.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_11]: And going to be the 60th year of Grateful
Dead Music.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, man, it seems like their music is
bigger today than it was when when Jerry
[SPEAKER_11]: checked out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's Grateful Dead cover bands in
every, you know, part of the country
[SPEAKER_11]: performing that music.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's really famous musicians who
perform the music of Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it has something to do with
staying power, the music.
[SPEAKER_11]: But does it amaze you, Javi, like when you
look back, like to think that,
[SPEAKER_11]: oh, my God, here it is, like so many years
after Jerry's gone and the actual
[SPEAKER_11]: configuration that we knew is the Grateful
Dead has been ceased to exist for a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that body of music exists.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I think it has to do with
the taping.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they allowed taping at their
shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a really smart move.
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't seem like a smart move at the
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you think about it, there's more
recording of the Grateful Dead than any
[SPEAKER_11]: other band on the planet.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think about like all the tapes and
everyone's collections and the way it's
[SPEAKER_11]: the way it was traded.
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it's just it's phenomenal just to
think about.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the music.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think the music is important and
the music is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is definitely 100 percent true,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think more than the to me,
the real reason the dead is still relevant
[SPEAKER_14]: and people listen to the music and the
cover bands.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all the similar bands and jam bands is
because the spirit of what the dead was
[SPEAKER_14]: and that connective tissue that they were
for humanity in as a community was so
[SPEAKER_14]: needed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like one of the what would the world be
like?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you can't take you can like I love
Jimi Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Led Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the Beatles.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love a lot of classic rock.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you could remove all those people from
those bands from the world and the world
[SPEAKER_14]: would be different.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you took the dead out of the human
history of the world, man, we it would be
[SPEAKER_14]: very different.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: They they created this cultural movement
that branched off into all these different
[SPEAKER_14]: facets and the cannabis and the glass and
the culture and the tech into art,
[SPEAKER_14]: into, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like a they're like an
anthropological phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, yeah, like like what
happened in and around that scene,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially as it relates to cannabis and
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess having a good time in general
is, you know, like if you go to a Billy
[SPEAKER_11]: String, so Billy String's again,
just like incredible musician and he's got
[SPEAKER_11]: a scene outside of his shows, the
proverbial shakedown street, right,
[SPEAKER_11]: where there's people who are vending all
kinds of, you know, wares and you can get
[SPEAKER_11]: good glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can probably get good weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the thing is, is that that that
business model of having a culture kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: develop around your music, I think the
dead were the first to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because like you, the great bands that you
mentioned, and I grew up listening to prog
[SPEAKER_11]: rock, ELP, yes, you know, Genesis,
great music and such a, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: period of time when, you know,
when you got records, you had to go to the
[SPEAKER_11]: record store the day the album was
released and then you brought that album
[SPEAKER_11]: home and you clean your weed on it and you
put the headphones on and you got lost in
[SPEAKER_11]: Pink Floyd animals or, you know,
remember all that music that kind of like
[SPEAKER_11]: it created.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this goes back to this episode,
right, Caleb, a connection between the
[SPEAKER_11]: human experience of music and like getting
high, like when you got home with that
[SPEAKER_11]: talking heads album that was just released
and you're getting high and you're
[SPEAKER_11]: listening to that album for the first
time, like maybe you've heard a couple of
[SPEAKER_11]: the songs on the radio, but like it's not
like it is today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you heard that song on the radio.
[SPEAKER_11]: You had to wait till the radio station
plays it again to hear it again.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember listening to to wrapped up like
a douche, another runner in a night.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, oh my God, did they just say
douche?
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to go back and listen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even know that that was a Bruce
Springsteen song.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were fucking high as hell inside my
friend's sister's car.
[SPEAKER_11]: We couldn't even finish the joint that we
started smoking.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, the connection that we had
back in the FM music days between,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, getting a record for the first
time at the record store and then going
[SPEAKER_11]: home and smoking some weed and putting it
on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember, you know, brothers and
sisters, the Almond Brothers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the day that Terrapin Station
came out, the day that Shakedown Street
[SPEAKER_11]: came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you went to the record store,
got the record, went home, rolled a joint,
[SPEAKER_11]: got high, put the headphones on and
listened to that music for the first time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a magical experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just rolled the joint on the record.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the record.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was the same way, but I had some
different artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like Red Man, Method Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Snoop Dogg, some Dr. Dre,
Connick 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Explosive, baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I was a white kid living in the
suburbs growing up in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just I was listening to WNEW in
New York and whatever they played.
[SPEAKER_11]: I first heard Elvis Costello, first heard
The Talking Heads, first heard Squeeze,
[SPEAKER_11]: all those great bands.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't seem like music is that way
anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the music that's today is just
doesn't have the substance that,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, that music of the 60s and the
70s.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I think the music is great,
even better in some respects, because it's
[SPEAKER_14]: everywhere in performance.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the ability.
[SPEAKER_14]: The record companies can't present the art
the way they used to.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now record companies can only
present the most commercial fast food
[SPEAKER_14]: version of it because it's been taken away
from them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Music is now in the hands of the Internet.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like there is no like it's sad for
kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not to have that collective
experience of of the way we did.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the music part's alive.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not the product.
[SPEAKER_17]: The way the music is this weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's too many people trying to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not all deserving to be growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's too many people trying to be
artists.
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe they're not all talented.
[SPEAKER_17]: And because the record labels no longer
invest heavily in artist development and
[SPEAKER_17]: creative the same way, the stories aren't
being told.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's just a lot of there's just a
lot.
[SPEAKER_17]: But of course, I'm sure there's the same
amount of talent percentage wise in the
[SPEAKER_17]: world.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just harder to dig through it and
find it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I just think about me searching
on the Internet from something now
[SPEAKER_17]: compared to 10, 15.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't find anything.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know where shit is.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how you find out about stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that's that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like it is all about the Internet and
so many people trying to do it similar to
[SPEAKER_17]: weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's just so many people go,
oh, weed's cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to be down with weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what makes it hard.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to know that consumers have to
weed through all that themselves to find
[SPEAKER_17]: out who the real weed people are.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, back then, too, it was more like
this like main component of where the
[SPEAKER_19]: music was coming out from.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were all listening to similar
records.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were all inspired by similar bands.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were all being inspired in very
similar.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were moving to the same places and
going to each other's concerts.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so it was kind of like now that's not
how music is chosen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like now music is chosen through the
infinite hyphae of the mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_19]: It can come from a billion different ways.
[SPEAKER_19]: It does it certainly does not need to be
limited through like the record label,
[SPEAKER_19]: which was pretty much the way music was
fed to us back in the day.
[SPEAKER_19]: If the label didn't get behind it,
it would be it would have been very hard
[SPEAKER_19]: for you to have been turned on to Led
Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw some artists talking about what they
would do to fix it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they go super simple.
[SPEAKER_17]: Put CD players in cars.
[SPEAKER_17]: Start selling CDs, put CD players back in
cars and get rid of all this digital
[SPEAKER_17]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even have any music on my phone.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how to download anything but
my own music.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I listen to music on YouTube because I
don't know how to use Spotify,
[SPEAKER_17]: but put CD players back in cars,
sell the CDs and physical stores and no
[SPEAKER_17]: more streaming.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's again, just going back to
like what the jam band scene is now and
[SPEAKER_11]: like Nugs.net, you know, all the couch
tour stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the broadcasts of live performances.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the Grateful Dead changed the way
live music is presented.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, yeah, now anyone with an
Instagram or YouTube channel can be an
[SPEAKER_11]: artist.
[SPEAKER_11]: And back then you needed to be picked up
by a major record label to be distributed
[SPEAKER_11]: or else people wouldn't know who you were.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think what the dead did quietly all
during the 80s is just played night after
[SPEAKER_11]: night.
[SPEAKER_11]: They played a different show every night
and they had kids like me hooked because,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I remember when I had to justify
to my dad who thought I was in college and
[SPEAKER_11]: I was coming home for dinner one Easter
and we had to change the time of the
[SPEAKER_11]: dinner so I could make it to the Hartford
show that night.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like an obsession.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they thought that we were
obsessed and I had to kind of like
[SPEAKER_11]: rationalize the Grateful Dead like
baseball.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, well, yeah, it's different every
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like every night was
different.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think every band was like that
at the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now I think, again, there's this
whole scene of bands who can exist without
[SPEAKER_11]: having mass popularity and not being,
you know, a band like Mo, for example.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Mo is a great example.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have achieved a certain level of
success.
[SPEAKER_11]: Their band admin office is all family
members, so they kind of keep it in the
[SPEAKER_11]: family and they play small little venues.
[SPEAKER_11]: Daniel, like this, they just played Stow
Cider the other night and, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: like small venues, kind of like Zen Bar
and like things that are nice in Vermont
[SPEAKER_11]: that has, you know, cultural significance
in that when you go there, you're
[SPEAKER_11]: supporting a local venue.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the money you're spending behind the
bar isn't going to some live nation big
[SPEAKER_11]: venue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to a small venue owner here in
the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so things kind of stay homegrown.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there's certain levels of
success that you can achieve now without
[SPEAKER_11]: being, you know, Ariana Grande or some,
you know, big blown up act these days.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's still a lot of great music going
on today, but I don't think that it's I
[SPEAKER_11]: don't think it would be like it was in the
60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they don't sell they don't sell
records to dance point because that but
[SPEAKER_14]: they they make their money.
[SPEAKER_14]: Performing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of what the dead did.
[SPEAKER_14]: They also didn't sell as nearly as many
records as they did perform and put people
[SPEAKER_14]: in seats.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're a good band and you can
perform, you know, people do appreciate
[SPEAKER_14]: live music.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is amazing music.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just lately, like like a couple of
months ago, Spotify took me on a thread
[SPEAKER_14]: that I wouldn't have gone down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been like listening to some
really cool music that I never would have
[SPEAKER_14]: selected.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got but I got lucky because 90
percent of the time I ever tried that
[SPEAKER_14]: before it took me down this commercial
avenue that I didn't like.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd always just play the music that I
wanted to listen to.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I started letting it go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, wow, wow, you guys took me
to like 70s Ethiopian jazz funk.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, this really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'm like obsessed with Ethiopian
jazz funk.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, as long as there's people smoking
marijuana, right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, as we used to say, you know,
you get five days to get together,
[SPEAKER_18]: you got to drink alcohol, they get into a
fight.
[SPEAKER_18]: You get five people, you get them a joint.
[SPEAKER_18]: Next thing you know, they're starting a
band.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's still the creativity out there.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, you know, we've seen a
demographic.
[SPEAKER_18]: I grew up playing a traditional
instrument, right.
[SPEAKER_18]: About a decade ago, I mean, Guitar Center
and others said the number one selling
[SPEAKER_18]: things are DJ equipment.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's it's it's just changed its creativity
and perception.
[SPEAKER_18]: What people were doing on a fret board,
they started doing with turntables and
[SPEAKER_18]: sounds and and really experimenting and
taking things.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's always going to be an ebb and
flow.
[SPEAKER_18]: You remember, you know, rock and roll was
going to be the devil's music,
[SPEAKER_18]: but jazz was the devil's music.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then hip hop was the devil's music.
[SPEAKER_18]: So just make music.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're always going to be accused of being
on the side of the devil because you're
[SPEAKER_18]: being creative.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, just do it and whatever
happens is just as as ever.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's talk how I did it,
which was making a mixtape and,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, then, you know, a forty five and
just, you know, going to wax and stuff
[SPEAKER_18]: like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: That went away.
[SPEAKER_18]: But now it's back.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_18]: So because when I grew up, I was only
buying seven inches.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: My first seven inch was lay freak,
you know, freak out, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: But that was again, what was it was an
affordable medium.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: A forty five was, you know, less than a
buck back then.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was two songs.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got one song and then you got one song
you never heard on the other side.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Or that you occasionally listen to.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: But then that what changed into.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: What how many of us belong to a music
service?
[SPEAKER_18]: But like the old school where you get 10
tapes and, you know, then you have to buy
[SPEAKER_18]: them over a series of time.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then it became CD and then it's now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we then we all destroyed our
computers with limewire.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Or our friends or our parents computers.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I used Kazaa Kazaa.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because then you have to burn music.
[SPEAKER_18]: So just it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as the music's there, people will
find a way to get it out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's different.
[SPEAKER_18]: The music industry is completely changed.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm glad that it's changed because
I've been a musician.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was an artist.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was I was a music artist.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't a music player in the sense that
you're in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a whole other realm of realities
that, you know, you have to be really
[SPEAKER_18]: good, talented, but you've got to also
have some luck and love and a way to get
[SPEAKER_18]: that music out.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, cannabis spreads still by
smoking circles and the music will
[SPEAKER_18]: continue to spread just in different ways,
shapes and forms.
[SPEAKER_18]: And something's going to evolve from,
you know, the turntables to something else
[SPEAKER_18]: eventually that's currently being made
right now that people are scoffing at and
[SPEAKER_18]: laughing at will soon eventually become
the dominant paradigm in music.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just how it goes, because
Generation Alpha, right.
[SPEAKER_18]: The new generation will reject our
conventional music and find something and
[SPEAKER_18]: create something else.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the beauty of music.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever they do create.
[SPEAKER_19]: I do hope to see a world where you can go
to a musical experience and have cannabis
[SPEAKER_19]: be the drug of choice that's set up to
support your intake of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not all booze.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not all you come in.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're like, oh, welcome, Mr. DJ Hard
Hitta.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got your table right over here with
your pre-rolled blunts, as you
[SPEAKER_19]: pre-requested.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the VIP service.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need that on the pull up, on command,
on demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that is that in your writer?
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, put it in your writer.
[SPEAKER_17]: Others have we also what I do when I do
shows is I have somebody go around the
[SPEAKER_17]: crowd, hand out a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll usually get bags of lighters and
pre-rolls and stickers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's easier, but I'll just pop a whole
bunch of pre-rolls and get everybody
[SPEAKER_17]: smoking our herbs.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll get the people performing that I'm
opening for smoking the herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I get everybody in there smoking
the herb.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I throw more off stage.
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I'm excited to talk music.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been working on my music for a long
time and have kept it pretty private and
[SPEAKER_17]: personal.
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I mentioned earlier, I just
debuted my first release back in August.
[SPEAKER_17]: And what's cool is I've got decades worth
of songs that I'm going to all start
[SPEAKER_17]: putting out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so my plan is to start a label and
have a whole strategy of what I want to do
[SPEAKER_17]: with this music.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want people to hear it and hope
maybe they have a similar impact.
[SPEAKER_17]: Or enjoy it the way I do.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the balance is running a cannabis
company and having the time to break away
[SPEAKER_17]: from that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's my hope and balance is to start
consistently releasing music on a monthly
[SPEAKER_17]: basis.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's more and more.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I need to free up the time to shoot
the music videos and write the blogs and
[SPEAKER_17]: do the fucking other things to get it out
there.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I appreciate an opportunity to come on
and speak about it and be interesting if
[SPEAKER_17]: people check it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I definitely want to get links for
everyone that has, whether it's your
[SPEAKER_19]: Spotify setlist that you like to listen
to, whether it's your own music,
[SPEAKER_19]: links to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I spoke with Caleb earlier at the end of
the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely want to have all of your
contacts and links to in the description
[SPEAKER_19]: of the video soon after we're done.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if Caleb doesn't have those already,
make sure you send him an email with those
[SPEAKER_19]: so that the minute the show's done,
because the show will get like 5,000 views
[SPEAKER_19]: in the next five or six days.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it'll be like, we want those links to
be up right away.
[SPEAKER_19]: It might go up another 5,000 views in the
next month or two.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in a very short period of time,
we'll get a lot of eyes on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it'd be nice to give everyone the
proper exposure to what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_19]: especially with music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Tupac made me smoke a lot of weed
too, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tupac was a good one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: Once again, through this bubble bag thing,
like even someone was mentioning Bear,
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, I met Bear.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I met Bear because he saw bubble.
[SPEAKER_19]: I met Skunkman Sam because he saw bubble
bags online.
[SPEAKER_19]: He reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, if it don't bubble,
ain't it worth the trouble?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you know who first said that?
[SPEAKER_19]: And I could even hear the aggression in
his voice when he asked me on the email.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was just like, yeah, I know who it
is, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_19]: I respect you.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't want me to use it,
I won't.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you do, I will, whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was super cool about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We became friends soon after.
[SPEAKER_19]: I met Bear the same way.
[SPEAKER_19]: He reached out to me about bubble bags and
with some random, he's like, I think
[SPEAKER_19]: butter is better than bubble.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_19]: Who the fuck is this character who's in
his eating butter infused butter towards
[SPEAKER_19]: the end of Owsley Stanley's life.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was all about the infused butter.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably how he flipped his tracker.
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, he was eating a lot of this
butter.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, yeah, he was a super pro meat guy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, forget about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like he was all his consumption of
cannabis at the end was was through
[SPEAKER_19]: butter, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm I'm pro all cannabis consumption use,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, so met lots of characters over
the years.
[SPEAKER_19]: With the with the bubble bags,
a lot of different characters that even
[SPEAKER_19]: we've mentioned today here.
[SPEAKER_19]: But oh, the Tupac one, I was going to say
didn't meet Tupac, obviously, but I met
[SPEAKER_19]: Mike Dean, who I guess produced.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, dude, Mike Dean, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mike Dean reached out to me years ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had no idea who he was.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's like a fuck.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's the man, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like he does a lot of work with a lot of
artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's he's had a lot of work with these
people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, he used to send he would send me
unreleased Scarface music that was like
[SPEAKER_19]: that no one had heard yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He worked on all the Scarface music,
him, you know, Joe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarface himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the painting this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should really take that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarface was the painting this with Mike
Dean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this guy here, he's he's an
incredible musician.
[SPEAKER_03]: He should get an invite today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd do a whole show around Mike Dean.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, he was another one that reached
out about bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I ended up getting him a set of bags
and just kind of a heady dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was kind of when Mike first reached out
to me, I was like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is where bubble bags are going to get
their first mentioned.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to get like bubble hash
something.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to get a mention in some some
hip hop song.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know Mike, but it just you know
what?
[SPEAKER_19]: It leaned into the reggae and it was the
reggae that got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, no, no, we got this.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He even worked with Travis Scott and all
of those guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kanye.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was like posting pictures of him up
with Madonna, like not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to say, you know, it's not
just being in musicians to get involved.
[SPEAKER_18]: In cannabis, I was with the Cannabis
Action Network back in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Lollapalooza and the Horde tour
liked that we were grassroots cannabis
[SPEAKER_18]: people.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we went out on tour and then Primus
and Fishbone and various others were like,
[SPEAKER_18]: we like what y'all are doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Come out with us and educate people on
tours.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, you can this you don't have
to be a musician to necessarily plug into
[SPEAKER_18]: the scene, because what we found is when
we were doing these tours, the musicians
[SPEAKER_18]: were all coming to us.
[SPEAKER_18]: I met various musicians scoring,
you know, on the buses from the the bass
[SPEAKER_18]: tech.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the actual seller on the tour.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So everybody went and visited.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, it's just the reality is
cannabis and music are tied at the hip.
[SPEAKER_18]: The cannabis doesn't travel without music
and music doesn't travel without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I learned from the inside
scene.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, again, you don't have to necessarily
be musically inclined to tap into the
[SPEAKER_18]: culture.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're active and you're genuinely
working towards as we were, they will
[SPEAKER_18]: respond.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not only that, they'll invite you on the
tour.
[SPEAKER_18]: We weren't paid to be on the tour.
[SPEAKER_18]: We had to pay our way through and sell our
own T-shirts and do that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: But those are ways that you can just plug
in if you're not.
[SPEAKER_18]: Or if you want to get along for the scene,
become a roadie, you know, learn how to
[SPEAKER_18]: plug in and play and do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are real jobs.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done that myself.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can get around and see a lot of
the world and music just being behind the
[SPEAKER_18]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a tight knit family that way.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
Musicians.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys want to say.
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Hardhead and what I mean, I just want
to say Scarface is really inspirational to
[SPEAKER_17]: me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Big, big Scarface fan and mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, big brother, I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I work in the general manager's
office at Rap-A-Lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, my boss just passed away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The legendary Mike Mack.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rap-A-Lot, everything having to do
with all of the music, the catalog,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything except for Council Pailborn and
Steven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of Rap-A-Lot records as a house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is management, marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting the video shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarface, man, that's like my favorite
artist of all time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, most people think of Scarface as,
you know, and they hear his stuff that
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of took off when he became more
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_17]: But Scarface's early music is he's
considered your favorite rapper's favorite
artist.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's considered my favorite rapper because
the way that he wrote and the way he did
[SPEAKER_17]: storytelling, it's on par with like a
slick Rick.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's it's a very, you know,
unique, you know, standout artist that was
[SPEAKER_17]: really inspirational to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially because it's all Mary,
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, imagine he's sending me his shit
unreleased like it hasn't even gotten out
[SPEAKER_19]: yet.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he said he's like, here, check this
one out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd I'd see it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would say Scarface MP4.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Crack this thing open and listen to it
like 25 times in a row, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, how did I somehow hit the
jackpot where this dude reached out to me
[SPEAKER_19]: to buy my bags is now sending me
unreleased music.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bless you, Mike Dean.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate you, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he's an incredible rapper,
dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: That guy is amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Narrative skills and and vivid,
often dark tales of life in Houston.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Struggles, struggles of the streets,
introspection.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's unique about Scarface is he was
probably one of the first rappers to talk
[SPEAKER_17]: about struggles with mental health,
you know, like hip hop is so masculine.
[SPEAKER_17]: But his early music, he would talk about
the own battles that he was having in his
[SPEAKER_17]: mind and some pretty dark stuff,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, really, really deep.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's an interesting dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just watching interviews of him.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it kind of plays to today where
you see I don't know how many of you guys
[SPEAKER_19]: have been exposed to Ren.
[SPEAKER_19]: But Ren was going to be Ren was kind of
going to be like some big, big thing in
[SPEAKER_19]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know if it was he was supposed
to be a pop star or something,
[SPEAKER_19]: but he had major, major mental health
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then just inwardly converted his
mental health breakdown into a focus on
[SPEAKER_19]: executing authentic music, his authentic
music.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you don't know who he is,
I would definitely implore you to go check
[SPEAKER_19]: it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got some cool concepts for a longest
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: All the videos I'd seen of Ren were him
busking out in the streets of whatever
[SPEAKER_19]: city.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's some Amsterdam ones and
some London ones, but he'd just be busking
[SPEAKER_19]: and really, really crushing it and doing a
wide variety of music.
[SPEAKER_19]: But some of his more non covers,
his own authentic music, there's he's he's
[SPEAKER_19]: he's basically having a conversation with
his his dark passenger, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: His mental illness is like the voice in
his head.
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's wearing just a like hospital gown
and he's sitting in this sort of dark and
[SPEAKER_19]: dingy room on an acoustic guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really fucking powerful if you
haven't seen it, I would I would check it
[SPEAKER_19]: out.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's worth looking into.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just you know, from what Dan mentioned
about Scarface, speaking about mental
[SPEAKER_19]: health, Ren is definitely picking up that
baton and going deep with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really exposing the that nitty gritty dark
side of mental health that really everyone
[SPEAKER_19]: has suffered from at one point in time,
some worse than others for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: But everyone's tasted it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we got about a half an hour left
today on the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: If there's anything I know I was going to
end it, I had a concept that I was going
[SPEAKER_19]: to ask you guys about.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have to remember that I did have kind
of the last 10 or 15 minutes of a question
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to ask everyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: But in the meantime, we have about a half
an hour if anyone wants to speak to
[SPEAKER_19]: anything in particular or talk about
projects that they're up to.
[SPEAKER_19]: That maybe the people who are listening
would like to know about.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we have three or four hundred
people watching live right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, let's go with three hundred and
twenty five, three twenty six.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm always happy to talk about
stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's any topic you guys would like
to discuss, you know, from genetics and
[SPEAKER_17]: ongoing stuff with, you know, breeding,
cultivation, music.
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that came to mind earlier that
kind of resonated was like cultivating and
[SPEAKER_13]: giving giving space for the grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like in creating music or or
the creative process, it's good sometimes
[SPEAKER_13]: to be out in nature and that disconnect.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a connection with cannabis
and music.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'd love to speak to that maybe a
little bit, because I know in NorCal
[SPEAKER_13]: Emerald Triangle in the Santa Cruz
Mountains or where I grew up in gold
[SPEAKER_13]: country, that connection to get into the
roots and creation, I think, is best
[SPEAKER_13]: paired cannabis and music together,
but also taking that time, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: on the hill and taking that time in the
wild, the wild element to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_13]: music.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel that I there's no human beings
within a half a mile of me in any
[SPEAKER_17]: direction.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I like it that way.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really like my privacy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's because, you know,
I've been trying not to get busted for
[SPEAKER_17]: weed a lot of my life.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, both here in Vermont and
in California, both both properties are
[SPEAKER_17]: off grid solar and battery.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, I like to visit cities
and more populated areas to kick it and do
[SPEAKER_17]: cool stuff and experience culture and
visit people.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I definitely prefer to be,
you know, more, you know, in natural
[SPEAKER_17]: surroundings and try to preserve them as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's where I like to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's where I like to write and do
music.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely have a massive affinity for
music, not much of a creator of it,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, played drums and always enjoyed
drum circles and have a lovely collection
[SPEAKER_19]: of drums and got an acoustic guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: Eventually, I play left handed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there was never it just was never
convenient for me to learn from anyone.
[SPEAKER_19]: If someone knew guitar and had a guitar,
it was strapped the wrong way for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just I didn't I didn't fit into
that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's OK, because I was directed into
creating nice hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was happy with my pathway.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can always still pick up my guitar
today and start playing it again,
[SPEAKER_19]: which is a beautiful thing about music.
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's definitely played an important
role in just my life.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can see it in my kids, too,
my daughter in particular, how important
[SPEAKER_19]: music is to her, just that connection.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nice to have a track to your to your
different experiences of your life and
[SPEAKER_19]: where you hear music and you can remember
specific times.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, music is, I think, got us all
through times of no pot.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Than anything else.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, from this, you know,
when I went to combat, when I was in the
[SPEAKER_18]: army, I made my own mixtapes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I brought a an outback Sony outback
fucking tape player.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I needed something heavy duty to
survive.
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, I mean, all the toughest,
most hardest times in my life.
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing that's pulled me out is
music.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: That has always been my lifeline.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that the same for everybody else?
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Through hard times.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as mentioned when I first jumped on
that losing everything in the fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I was blessed about in the
community here in the Emerald Triangle was
[SPEAKER_15]: that not only did farmers see what
happened to me and bless me with trusting,
[SPEAKER_15]: getting their trust to make hash for them,
but also I got to DJ harvest parties.
[SPEAKER_15]: I DJ'd a lot of parties out in the hills
that helped helped me rebuild myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: The beauty of community here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to learn to grow the weed from
scratch to everything, everything that I
[SPEAKER_07]: can learn about growing everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, there's no shortage, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: And let me tell you, there's a lot of good
people sharing information about such a
thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Plus you live in a place where when you
plant seeds, they grow so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if somebody legends could drop
some of the links, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where we can read up or learn a couple of
things, a couple of videos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, some of them are talking about some
YouTube links.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can link you up with all sorts of
information, Kazam, including people and
[SPEAKER_19]: even people in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I said, the best way to learn,
in my opinion, in Jamaica, you could go
[SPEAKER_19]: intern.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you have to have time to be able
to give to it, but you could go donate and
[SPEAKER_19]: volunteer your time at different grows
where you know, someone has a vast array
[SPEAKER_19]: of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's sort of the person running it,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to work with someone who's
exceptional and who has a good
[SPEAKER_19]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's definitely certainly incredible
growers on Hash Church that have been
[SPEAKER_19]: dropping really good information for the
last like 10 years on here.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't know where would you guys that
are on the panel suggest getting really
[SPEAKER_19]: good, you know, growing cannabis
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like where does one find such a thing at
this point in time?
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember there used to be key websites,
but now there just must be a billion and
[SPEAKER_19]: one different sources for this.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a lot to sort through these days.
[SPEAKER_17]: So much.
[SPEAKER_17]: Plant some seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hit me up if you want.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give you some seeds and plant seeds
and, you know, gain experience and find
[SPEAKER_17]: the best people, you know, who are growing
weed and try to look over their shoulder
[SPEAKER_17]: and ask questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And give me some seeds if you want some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'd love to keep connected.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's good to build relationships.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of interviews.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of podcasts are a wonderful way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like there's a lot of knowledge
there and an actual growing is a rite of
[SPEAKER_13]: passage.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to be humbled sometimes and keep
growing and learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's definitely something that I've been
humbled by this plant so much,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I also get so fired up when it's time
to germinate and get the soil ready and
[SPEAKER_13]: get back into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every seed is a prayer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every breath is a prayer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every year is an honor to walk with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So stay connected.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_19]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're outside again, Kazam.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought you were at work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm outside again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of the office.
[SPEAKER_06]: All over the place right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm definitely going to link you guys all
up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure on the email that I sent out
that everyone replies back with their
[SPEAKER_19]: contact information or I can get it all
from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to make sure you guys all have
access to each other
[SPEAKER_19]: because that is always convenient.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, give thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did send an email.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we'll make that happen for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll compile some as well, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_17]: We sat here and smoked weed for a long
time.
It's fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, every Sunday we do this for about
four hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: We go into different levels of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was nice to have a kind of a different
panel today with some of the regulars as
[SPEAKER_19]: well and sort of have this conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this conversation definitely has
the capability of going deeper.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a little bit of a harder one to
crack, you know, that that cannabis music
[SPEAKER_19]: relationship and how absolutely in-depth,
like how important it was in so many
[SPEAKER_19]: different genres of music that came out if
you follow cannabis use back to really
[SPEAKER_19]: like old jazz music.
[SPEAKER_19]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a really hard time doing music and
making music without weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's one time in my life where I was
challenged where, you know, I was in a
[SPEAKER_17]: position where I couldn't smoke and I
wanted to write.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I had to really challenge myself as
a writer to see what I was made of.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was able to write some stuff that I
thought was really special.
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I said about the amplifier,
when I write, I just I start smoking.
[SPEAKER_17]: And what it what it does is it,
you know, I believe that it connects.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's also a conduit,
a connector.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, they talk about your
conduit.
[SPEAKER_17]: Consciousness.
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you use weed, it can open up a
lot of things that otherwise you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_17]: have access to.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's where when I work on
music, whatever is is coming from,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, is largely, you know,
coming from the influence that the herb
[SPEAKER_17]: has when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it's kind of like a wave that
you're trying to ride because like if you
[SPEAKER_17]: hit it the right way, all this shit is
bursting out and all this creative stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you'll put things down that you
can't go back later and understand where
[SPEAKER_17]: it came from that all kind of connects and
clicks.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if there's too much or too
little, you know, that's that's what it's
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of like for me as I as I use,
you know, or when I when I write and stuff
[SPEAKER_17]: from my own experience.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the key to your door of creativity.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: It unlocks your door.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: We all have individual doors of creativity
that we don't know how to unlock.
[SPEAKER_18]: It just unlocks.
[SPEAKER_18]: And when it's there, you best bathe in
that shit, you know, because if you don't,
[SPEAKER_18]: you're going to potentially miss
lightning.
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's just a hum, a beep.
[SPEAKER_18]: A melody, a lyric.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got to immediately jot it down.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And get, you know, capture that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, it's gone to the ether.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to sleep and you don't jot it
down, you were not waking up the next
[SPEAKER_18]: morning and hearing it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, when you're in that flow and
I found that's what I find with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis is that key that unlocks that
door, that creativity and that flow.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're not ready for it, you better be
ready for it because it's coming inside
[SPEAKER_17]: you.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's exactly how I feel.
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of times I'll be driving and I'm
supposed to have phone calls and I'll
[SPEAKER_17]: smoke, I'll get really high and I'll hear
a beat.
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of a sudden, that's what I have to
do.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll just write while I drive.
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of my songs are actually written on
notes on my phone, hitting the just repeat
[SPEAKER_17]: over again on the instrumental on long
drives and stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you can't lose the opportunity if you
get that intense energy of creation
[SPEAKER_17]: coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if you're, you know,
if you're in a musical collaboration,
[SPEAKER_11]: like I've always said that you can't you
can't make music with people that you
[SPEAKER_11]: can't communicate with.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, like think about just the sort
of like the situation where like if a guy
[SPEAKER_11]: is screwing your woman, you can't make
music with that guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you have to be in a place where
you're vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes I think, right, Dan,
sometimes cannabis gets you there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in a group of musicians and
everyone's getting high and everyone's
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of like on the same wavelength,
when you lower those those guards,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can really start communicating
musically with other people in a
[SPEAKER_11]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where the Gestalt thing comes
into play, because what you're doing now
[SPEAKER_11]: is bigger than just the individual players
themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's this communication that
happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: Amongst musicians when you're playing in a
small group, and everyone's kind of on
[SPEAKER_11]: that same kind of wavelength.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really exciting when that happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think everyone in the ensemble
recognizes it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't always happen.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think cannabis can help you get
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: It can also help you recognize it while
you're watching and it's happening.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it also can get you together to
synchronize.
Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had my band used to practice.
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to have a band called Northern
Lights, number five, so that when we
[SPEAKER_18]: played high, we were ready for it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't practice and then go play high.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, if you're playing and
you're doing it right, you're hitting a
[SPEAKER_18]: level sometimes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_18]: Musicians who has not astral projected
while they're playing live literally left
[SPEAKER_18]: their body, left their being, and you're
just holding some spiritual ground to be
[SPEAKER_18]: there.
[SPEAKER_18]: But that connection is so solid.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_15]: Not everyone understands music.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a spiritual thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is powerful.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's well said.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you study for the test stone,
you better take the test high.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what happened, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really blew that taste.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you get super high before you took it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that was the problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to admit, I did take tests very
high and did fine on them, but maybe not
[SPEAKER_19]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_18]: They told us exactly what Mark said.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you study high, you better take the
test high.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was my TA in my English 101.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, oh, this is a life hack.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had no idea how much it was a life hack
I was learning.
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably the most, the best lesson I ever
learned in college.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit, eh?
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I can't tell you how many times,
but we would be like drummer would be off,
[SPEAKER_18]: bass player would be off, then let's get
take a break, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_18]: And next thing you know, you're back all
in sync.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have that happened?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like taking a test high.
[SPEAKER_13]: You jam high, you create high,
you find your verses and your choruses,
[SPEAKER_13]: you find the structure sometimes high
because you're open in that realm,
[SPEAKER_13]: that space that cannabis can help take
you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And playing long enough, you eventually
can communicate telepathically.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also experienced this with other
teachers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really important when you build
that rapport.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our group has been playing every week and
in weekends since 2010.
[SPEAKER_13]: So going on 15 years and you get to a
point where there's such a relationship,
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis kind of keeps that new.
[SPEAKER_13]: And listening to music too, I was thinking
about that too with the DJs on the panel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gonjo can get you to this place where you
can hear different things almost every
[SPEAKER_13]: time.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can hear listen to the same album,
same record, and there's still something
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of new there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's that beautiful infinity of
possibilities and novelty that Gonjo helps
[SPEAKER_19]: with.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm sure as appreciators of music,
lovers of music and cannabis, each and
[SPEAKER_19]: every one of you have had the experience
where you've been turning someone onto a
[SPEAKER_19]: song and you want them to focus on it as
much as you're focusing on it and really
[SPEAKER_19]: hear what that song is.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I would ask each and every one of
you, we'll go through the list,
[SPEAKER_19]: is to what is that song that you would
like to turn on the people that are
[SPEAKER_19]: listening to the podcast today for you?
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't mind going first.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something that you just, it's like an
exciting jam or it's an incredible guitar
[SPEAKER_19]: riff or it's an amazing bass or drum beat
or it could be vocals it could be whatever
[SPEAKER_19]: it is that you would just love for our
audience to hear if you had your one song.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to say for me, I'm gonna go,
and this is mainly because these are the
[SPEAKER_19]: most recent sort of musical experiences
I've been happening.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've gone down this Harry Mack rabbit
hole, this freestyle rapper guy that's
[SPEAKER_19]: just mind bending on every level.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think I was gonna say Omega 18,
but what I will say is rap Coltrane I
[SPEAKER_19]: think it's his rap soliloquies.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called rap Coltrane.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the two songs are called, well,
one is rap Coltrane and the other is Snake
[SPEAKER_19]: Eyes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just a YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go watch that after you take a big rip,
maybe put the closed captions on even
[SPEAKER_19]: though he's very clear.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to read the words while he's
saying them and let me know what you think
[SPEAKER_19]: in the comments sections of the video.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna pass it on to Dan and he's gonna
let you know what song does it for him.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that he'd really love you to listen to
with intent focus.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, Dan.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm weird with music.
[SPEAKER_17]: When I hear something I like, I like to
listen to it on repeat a lot because you
[SPEAKER_17]: do get a different expression of it every
time.
[SPEAKER_17]: But honestly, I'm gonna say I would like
for you to listen to my music.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, everything that I put out is
it's a true story.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all autobiographical and it's pretty
deep.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, I've only shared it just
recently.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you wanted to check it out,
you go to, you know, band camp and just
[SPEAKER_17]: search Rebel Grown, Danny Hussle,
mixtape volume one by Rebel Grown.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's produced by my friend Tasso,
who's an incredible DJ, an international
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ and producers toured all over the world
in six continents, tours half two thirds
[SPEAKER_17]: out of the year.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's really influential in the development
of juke or footwork, which is a whole kind
[SPEAKER_17]: of sub genre of electronic music and hip
hop that comes out of Chicago.
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole tech life thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's it's dope.
[SPEAKER_17]: What song would I would say is the illest
one would probably be the fourth song,
[SPEAKER_17]: but that would be dope if anybody wants to
check it out.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm curious to see what people think
of it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about Christopher Carr?
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, give thanks.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my first time on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pleasure to connect with all of
you, especially on such a intimate and
[SPEAKER_13]: inspiring topic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan, I like that you set the tone,
bro, because I think, yeah, we're we're
[SPEAKER_13]: here to big ups the fresh originals.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks and praises by Ancestry.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the name of the album.
[SPEAKER_13]: Twenty twenty four release.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Natalie rise on on wise,
humble and strong.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a unique track.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the title track, Thanks and
Praises, is is an homage to Ganja Ganja
[SPEAKER_13]: Ma.
[SPEAKER_13]: So always, always a pleasure to to connect
with like minds and like spirits and big
[SPEAKER_13]: ups, big ups.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love since Amiya with Black Uhuru.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another track that fires me up.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stunk Man Sam, how about you, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think one of my favorite one is
Positive Earth, but
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think from now on, everyone else is
going to also have to perform their
[SPEAKER_19]: favorite song.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think Sam just set the the tone
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Sam, for being you.
[SPEAKER_19]: No problem, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll take it from you, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you've got a whole shwack of songs,
but there's got to be one that's just
[SPEAKER_19]: like, is it like a standing on the moon?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it some old blues?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it what?
[SPEAKER_19]: What is what is some bluegrass?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, since this is Hash Church and it's
all about smoking, our favorite thing,
[SPEAKER_11]: why don't we use blaze on, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So climb that hill, stay on your feet,
scramble from your footing.
[SPEAKER_11]: When it gets too steep, you're on the
highway now with higher hopes while all
[SPEAKER_11]: around are rolling eggs with living yolks.
[SPEAKER_11]: You never get too sad.
[SPEAKER_11]: You never get too blue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It must be all those chemtrails raining
down on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: The justice of the peace won't have it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just took the covers off the justice
of war.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got your night shades on and your
first day's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the band plays on.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got more like blaze on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So blaze on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was just joking, but fuck way to
like set the bar even higher, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about Nick Reilly?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I don't know if I can live up to
that bar.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the drummer in all the musical
projects I'm in.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if you'll get some singing
out of me.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can drum it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to think about one,
but just a song that's really hit me kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of out of nowhere is a song called Change
by Big Thief.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's one of those like every year I go
back to it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're talking about like marking moments
in time and things like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm a real big fan of that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Same as Dan, too, just like listening to
something over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to pick a record of the year and
every morning doing tarps, I would listen
[SPEAKER_16]: to that same record over and over every
morning, kind of like set this little
[SPEAKER_16]: moment in time for the year.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, that song has become almost like
a yearly mark for me to listen to on
[SPEAKER_16]: repeat for a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thanks for sharing, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to check it out for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about Morning Glory?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, boy, as a DJ with ADHD, I have so many
songs on my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm going to have to I've been
thinking about it as well as been hearing
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone's inputs.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to have any bars because
it's a little more modern.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm going to say a song that I'm
probably choosing because I've been
[SPEAKER_15]: playing it every time I've been agitating
the biomass to make hash with this track.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Love Rocket by L.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dream.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to check that out for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: A little hash making music.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.
[SPEAKER_19]: So but as a DJ, do you have are you
playing songs as a DJ?
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I guess it's really I'm not a
musician or a DJ, but I imagine there's
[SPEAKER_19]: times where you're playing music for
yourself and that there's times where
[SPEAKER_19]: you're playing music for your audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I love about when I DJ a lot of
like, quote unquote, underground scenes is
[SPEAKER_15]: personally one of my favorite genres to
mix is house music.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also realize that not everyone loves
that type of music.
[SPEAKER_15]: So one thing I've been doing is on my
quest to find new tracks.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love finding like these Bay Area deep,
deep house style tracks that have like
[SPEAKER_15]: covers of 90 lyrics, 90s hip hop lyrics
are kind of like it's getting the vibe of
[SPEAKER_15]: modern, but bringing you back when you
hear these voices.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nostalgic vibes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about are you are you can you talk
Kazan?
[SPEAKER_19]: In the middle of you got a tune for us,
one that's special, one that makes the
[SPEAKER_19]: hair on the back of your neck stand up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Special you want to share with everyone
could be a tune that you wrote could be
[SPEAKER_19]: could be a tune that you just like.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one particular song I always go
back to.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called In the Pit There's a picture
on the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my house, there's a picture on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rastafari sit up on his throne.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, by visionaries, that is that is
always go back to that tune, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, straight up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to try to find all of these
tunes and then put them in a link in the
[SPEAKER_19]: description so that at the end of this
video, the people that made it all the way
[SPEAKER_19]: through can be like, all right,
now you get to hear kind of everyone's
[SPEAKER_19]: little I'm going to create a little
playlist of this group of songs that we
[SPEAKER_19]: have here.
[SPEAKER_19]: We still have Etienne Fontaine and Caleb
Chen to go through.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Etienne, if you want to go next,
tell us a song.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I like the instrumental muggles.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm from New Orleans, so it's from Louis
Armstrong back in the 20s.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if I had to choose one that always
gets me up and going, Cab Calloway's
[SPEAKER_18]: Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, have you ever met that funny
Reefer Man?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I love that song.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just it's I've always loved upbeat
songs.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was one of those earlier jazz
songs.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was like you're talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I understood what Reefer meant.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_18]: So that one when you're feeling up and
bumping.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that one is definitely one to put on
the party.
[SPEAKER_19]: Love it, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, last but certainly not least,
Caleb Chen, what is your song that you
[SPEAKER_19]: would love for people to listen to here to
finalize?
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess we missed Mojave.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mojave is in the chat, so I'll get him to
give his just through the chat and anyone
[SPEAKER_19]: else Colin and anyone else that may have
left already.
[SPEAKER_19]: But in the meantime, Caleb hit us with
your song.
[SPEAKER_17]: Really quick, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry for interrupting.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to change my answer is my favorite
song would be We Are the World.
[SPEAKER_06]: We Are the World.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I added it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll put them both up, Dan.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Song I want to share with everyone is
called Haze by Jackie Chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite songs about a specific
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun listen, you know, musically,
some people might not find enough to part,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, listen to the lyrics.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, dude, that's what we'll be doing
with listening to the lyrics.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I may reach out to each and every one
of you, depending on how well I did with
[SPEAKER_19]: the spelling of your band's name or the
song's name or the artist's name.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes if you make a mistake,
suddenly you can't find maybe Dr. Mark,
[SPEAKER_19]: you will want a specific version of Blaze
up on because it's fish.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if you want the album
version or if you want some ridiculous
[SPEAKER_19]: like 2023 version.
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of figured you would.
[SPEAKER_19]: So and anyone else that has a very
specific version of the track that they
[SPEAKER_19]: just mentioned, I should also mention
Stevie Ray Vaughan Texas Floodin is just
[SPEAKER_19]: absolutely insane if you just don't want
to if you want your brain to explode and
[SPEAKER_19]: watch this man play the guitar on a live
version.
[SPEAKER_19]: Find a live version.
[SPEAKER_19]: But in the meantime, I want to thank
everyone for coming out as far as as
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamaica to Humboldt to Vermont to British
Columbia where I am right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate everyone that's been watching
all morning.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had a big group of people with us,
over 300 people that have watched for the
[SPEAKER_19]: last four hours as we've been hanging out
and shooting the shit and talking about
[SPEAKER_19]: music and cannabis and the sort of
connection between those two things.
[SPEAKER_19]: Which is the sort of theme for this week
show.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of us have a deep appreciation for
both cannabis and music.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I liked how there was sort of reggae
and there was DJ music and there was,
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to shout out DJ Hard Hitta too.
[SPEAKER_19]: He bounced, but we'll get a track from him
as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like it might be a Scarface track,
but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll throw one in there anyway,
because we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, hopefully we can do this again
one of these days soon.
[SPEAKER_19]: Catch up with all of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank you for coming out and
Caleb for helping me organize this show.
[SPEAKER_19]: The show was his idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: He is the co-host today and we'll
definitely get him back as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: In the meantime, what I would say,
as I always say, may the full melt bless
[SPEAKER_19]: your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_19]: And in the meantime, see you next Sunday
everybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Love you all.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop.
