[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to put the baffles in the
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: The baffles help the water move properly
and the cannabis to the tank as it mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once it's nice thawed, it comes in
really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our different sizes of tanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm going to put the impeller into the
motor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the quick release coupling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let it fall down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to make sure it's in the
centered position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's there, you push up on the
spring, rotate it, let it drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop into position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the tank is ready to mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once you have the water level filled
up to the top of the baffle, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is thawed, it's time to start it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to turn on the impeller.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the tank first starts to mix,
it might need to list a little boost to
[SPEAKER_01]: start fluidizing the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get it up to your speed and then just
start to loosen material from the edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
Thanks for watching.
