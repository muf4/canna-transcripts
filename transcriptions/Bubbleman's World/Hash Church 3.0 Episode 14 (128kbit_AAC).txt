[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get ready here for the
live stream.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says we're streaming now, so I'm gonna
let in the folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, meeting is now streaming on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's invite these people in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I'd like to say is welcome
everyone to Hash Church 3.0 episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, let me shut my own mic off here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode 14 is what I wanted to say before
I got that shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to take the live link real
quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: If my computer wants to let me,
I will copy and paste that into the old
[SPEAKER_08]: link so everyone knows where we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: And wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, Wade and Etienne and Mr. Skunk
Man Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick on it this morning, are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Guten Morgen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can everyone hear Etienne?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: More troubleshooting for the bubble man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a fun morning of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspect it's me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me just get my video settings
sorted up here and get my audio settings
[SPEAKER_08]: changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you now, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lima Charlie.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lima Lima Charlie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make sure all is well here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot to do when you're trying to
kind of do the troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, everyone, into the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it recording on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it recording on my computer so I can
put it onto a podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just happy my computer keyboard is
working because at 8.45 this morning,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ended up jumping in the car,
driving down to the Lions Bay store and
[SPEAKER_08]: getting some AA batteries.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I probably paid $97 for two of
them, but that's OK as long as we're here
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're up and running.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what we got going on in the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, welcome, Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing this morning?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing lots of work at the
computer this year already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Friday and Saturday, I made time to
go outside and work on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that got my hands dirty,
broke a sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure didn't feel like January,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that West Coast living.
[SPEAKER_08]: January doesn't always feel like January
on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been getting a bit of that
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: My company made some pretty monstrous
announcements recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a couple of provinces signed up for
Embark to order our products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's like not a company.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a province.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be like hooking up a state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, I've got I've got California now
or I've got Washington now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we signed up both and British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those announcements were made on all
my social medias.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, bong rip to bubble man's keyboard
says F.E.
[SPEAKER_08]: raw medic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got over 100 people in the room right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: One hundred and sixty six actually
watching at nine oh three a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping all the email invitation
folks aren't thinking that we're not going
[SPEAKER_08]: because I did have I did have a little bit
of troubles this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see if they're all getting the email
to come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, I sent it to them for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you would have gotten that email again
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, so you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it a couple of minutes before nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, are you you're coughing quite a bit
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you all right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I just woke up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And rolled out of bed my first joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a little bit in the base.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, there's a little congestion in
the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a little bit of normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just my morning coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_08]: Arms up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B.'s got the arms up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to get the dab and I got this new
little tool called the turbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen this thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do I have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Mike West has been using one of
those for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was using one just the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I got one for Christmas present
from the great neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got it, like, I guess, of course,
the mail came late.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, cold starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six forty Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the other boat, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been using temp tech pretty
religiously, but now I'm just cold
[SPEAKER_08]: starting because I find that when I forget
my temp tech, I'm too annoyed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, man, I'm not going to get
that perfect dab and this, that and the
[SPEAKER_08]: other thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they definitely are different rips to
heat your banger up to like that nine
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it settle down and drop that dab in is
very different from a cold start.
[SPEAKER_08]: But cold start like, you know,
anything you can get the skills going and
[SPEAKER_08]: towards, you know, I've been doing it for
the last three or four days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure I'll end up going back to my
temp tech eventually.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's nice that we have these options
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did try the new Puffco peak and I was
impressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're very quiet again, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to get you a little bit louder.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, the Puffco peak, the new one,
I guess it's the Puffco peak pro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that thing rips.
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing like rips.
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't get me wrong, I also tried the
sort of middle version because you had the
[SPEAKER_08]: Puffco.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you had companies create a kit for
the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_08]: With a different heater, a different coil,
all, you know, different pieces that you
[SPEAKER_08]: could put in and that increased the
quality of the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now Puffco pro is released.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yeah, it's I was impressed with it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't own one, but it surprised me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I may try.
[SPEAKER_10]: I burned through four Puffco peaks,
so I kind of gave up on that instant,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, because I hear people all the
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've heard of Clubhouse,
but it's a new social media platform with
[SPEAKER_10]: live discussions and a lot of people get
on there and they start talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: their Puffco peaks.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I'll still stick with my
mothership and my de-nail thanks that
[SPEAKER_10]: actually still works.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like the Puffco peak pro.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of my cherished.
[SPEAKER_14]: I put this thing through the paces and
tried to find what could possibly be wrong
[SPEAKER_14]: with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the atomizer alone is such an
improvement.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the temperature is like you can
actually use like full melt in this device
[SPEAKER_14]: and get it to the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you can actually hit plus 10
degrees.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you start really, really low,
you can kind of bump up 10 plus degrees at
[SPEAKER_14]: a time.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I got this little kind of
recycler for it, which is really great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's Puffco kind of nailed it with
this one in a way that I was not
[SPEAKER_14]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's much better build quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, the most amazing thing about the
Puffco peak pro was actually that with
[SPEAKER_04]: your iPhone or any other smartphone,
you can program the temperature so that a
[SPEAKER_04]: single hit starts low and ends high.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another great part.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a cold start, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You hit it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get some of those turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: You hit it a little hotter.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_08]: You increase the temperature.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how the Trinity pen was designed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Trinity pen was designed that if you
hold that button down for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_08]: you'll get that 500 degree low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: You hold it down like a second full cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting up to a six, six 50 dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you did it four times, you could
literally get your Johnny B like 800
[SPEAKER_08]: Fahrenheit hot red nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I like the third hit
when I do the cold start and then I hit it
[SPEAKER_02]: with the torch again and heat it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, you're the anomaly,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want that hot rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only a certain times because a
lot of times in the morning, I really like
[SPEAKER_02]: that turpy like cold start.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like this turpa meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like those flavors in the morning,
but as the day progresses, I guess that
[SPEAKER_02]: hotter hit is what hits me harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the morning, those flavors wakes you
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're feeling more energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the day progresses, if it got some
good pain, then of course I hit it hot and
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm right back at it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Best friend farms is in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's just connecting his audio.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already like welcoming him when he's
not even like fully in, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: we got him hanging out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm about to do a little dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little bit nervous.
[SPEAKER_08]: This morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't felt that energy for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, am I going to fail at this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I going to like, be not able to do
this?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very strange to not have my
keyboard hook up to my cube computer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's never, that's never happened to me
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the joys of technology.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ridiculous yet on the same flip side,
the joys of technology, the very thing
[SPEAKER_08]: that allows us to get together during
these times of COVID and share our faces
[SPEAKER_08]: and our sort of emotional context and our,
our words together with all these
[SPEAKER_08]: different people that are watching online.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we have a, geez, I don't even
know how many we got in there right now,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'm sure it's a couple hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least it's not Google meetups anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that whole Google hangouts thing
was like not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 24 hours, 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you make your phone call and it's
screechy, screechy, screechy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought of you this, this week,
Marcus, the kumbale.
[SPEAKER_10]: In India has happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there in 1998.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be, yeah, that'll be some years
ago now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would advise anyone who wants to go
check out the Kumbh Mela in India to go
[SPEAKER_08]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a neat reason to have,
you know, if you're going to India,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a, it's a good spot to kind of have
on your horizon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't really affect your rest of your
traveling.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can obviously continue on.
[SPEAKER_08]: From wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's an Alabad,
Jaipur, Varanasi or Haridwar, but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_08]: it's going to be in one of those four
spots because it has been for the last,
[SPEAKER_08]: like, I don't know, 4,000 years or however
many thousands of years they've been doing
[SPEAKER_08]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely one of my eye openers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing experience for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoking, smoking hash on the, on the
Ganges with the Babas out of the Chilam.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he would, every day he must've said
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, honestly, this man was like skunk
man Sam in a, in a sadhu.
[SPEAKER_08]: All he said was one more Chilam we are
making, one more Chilam we are making.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of reminiscent of hanging
out with Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more bong load we are packing.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more bong load we are packing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Best friend Farms is going to make another
attempt to joining us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess he's also having maybe some
technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see he's trying to connect his audio
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the news, they, for the Kumbh Mela,
they, they had a sadhu that seemed to be
[SPEAKER_10]: rolling in front of the procession.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the rolling, the rolling sadhu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one guy and I met him at the
Maha Kumbh Mela.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had rolled from the Northern tip of
India to the Southern tip of India.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just rolled.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you meet people like this at the Kumbh
Mela.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met another guy who was holding his arm.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was holding his arm up for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had turned into a stone and you could
hang like heavy things off of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it was not like you, you couldn't
bend this guy's arm.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had turned into a stone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another guy had held his hand closed for,
I don't even know how long it was,
[SPEAKER_08]: but his nails were growing out the top of
his hand from him holding his hand in a
[SPEAKER_08]: fist.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just had nails coming out of his hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a guy standing on one leg as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he had been standing on one leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say for at least a decade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just he had this kind of thing set up to
hold his leg up.
[SPEAKER_08]: His leg was also a stone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't moving anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you looked at it closely, you were
like, Ooh, that doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely a trip to just, you know,
do things that the mind tells you are
[SPEAKER_08]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one thing I would say I had in
common that kept reoccurring itself with
[SPEAKER_08]: my trip to India was that I get,
I just kept witnessing the impossible
[SPEAKER_08]: things that I, my North American brain
didn't believe could, could happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe also was wondering why you would
want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, that sort of,
you know, just doing of this strange thing
[SPEAKER_08]: to almost to remove your consciousness
from your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you got to imagine the amount of
pain that that would have after a while
[SPEAKER_08]: when that limb was entropy and just dying
and just slowly, you know, not working
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely a trip, not something that,
Oh, what Mark's Mark saying he didn't get
[SPEAKER_08]: the zoom link again.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is so strange to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in the chat with us and he's,
everyone else gets it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all click on the link and they come
in, but Mark is not getting the link.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really don't know why that is even
more important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: My keyboard has disconnected from my,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a mouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a mouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I might be able to do it with the mouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do it with the mouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is funny though, that my keyboard has
done that again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be an update you need to put in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be a new keyboard for, for Mark
coming in here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope we don't disconnect and that
the mouse will do everything that we need
[SPEAKER_08]: because these are brand new batteries for
this keyboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just sent the link.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that that's happening lately and
I'm not sure why, like how could Mark be
[SPEAKER_08]: in a group chat with all of us?
[SPEAKER_08]: And not get the link to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas everyone else clicked on the very
same link I sent to the very same chat
[SPEAKER_08]: room.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a couple of minutes to sort out
because there was a thread of emails and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the initial, the first email that you
meant that you sent saying that you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a church this morning is the one
that has the link in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the subsequent emails did not have
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to go back to that first one
and open it all the way open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The zoom link.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what it is, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the DEA and the dark cannabis web.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to get Dr. Mark away from our
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the science.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the anti-science mafia once again,
just doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, hash church.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get these anti-hash churches.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what's funny is that 20 years
ago we would have been on all over that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit and it would have been for sure our
belief and it probably would have been
[SPEAKER_08]: also true.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not too far of a reality that
we've kind of come out of here,
[SPEAKER_08]: but now we've got Dr. Mark joining.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my keyboard set back up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everything is going as it should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Must be a plot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see him though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's trying to join.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about best friend farms?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in the house now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you like here and we can hear you?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's muted, but he's here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: What up Brian?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're dealing with our technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Glad you made it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sending links to group chats that
you're in and the other people in the
[SPEAKER_08]: group chat are clicking on the link and
coming in and then you're like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not getting the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to go into my setting.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple Mark Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just make sure it's me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be Facebook friends with the
other ones, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that would be weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Mark Sheldon attorney.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Mark Sheldon fire chief.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Mark Sheldon beverage guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send invites to all them guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I found another ATN Fontaine in
France.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 16 Johnny B's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you punch in Mark Richardson into
Facebook, there definitely comes up about
[SPEAKER_08]: like three or 400 black guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I guess my name is more of a black
guy name than it is a white guy name,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least a quarter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've got a black guy in my
organization.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to start talking about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good at draw, which is a lot of guy.
I like drawing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I have an art class.
I have a lot of stuff to cover.
So I'm going to get some great stuff to
cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get some great stuff that I
don't need to go to a business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get some great stuff that I
don't need to go to a business so I can do
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff and do my work and I'll call it my
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to get some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get some four hours every day
but if it comes and it happens and the
[SPEAKER_08]: natural conversation seems to develop like
it usually does well then so be it and
[SPEAKER_08]: first off I want to shout out geez how do
I shout out rob his his name is like
[SPEAKER_08]: gizzard gizzard forever whatever one he's
on instagram he is the dude that took the
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess snapple advertisement that we've
jacked turned it into the all-natural
[SPEAKER_08]: hashish made from the best stuff on earth
and that is the avatar for the hash church
[SPEAKER_08]: show today so I wanted to give him a shout

[SPEAKER_08]: lined up it's funny to bring them in so
we're glad to have you here mark that was
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit scary that you weren't going
to make it in we always appreciate your
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective here and hash church and geez
without you talking my goodness that's
[SPEAKER_06]: that's half a show right there it's great
to be back I always check in with the chat
[SPEAKER_06]: in the morning usually over my coffee and
dab in the morning and I'll look to see
[SPEAKER_06]: who's on chat and you know usually it's
John Maddox and bingo already yep and 70s
[SPEAKER_06]: mama will be in there once in a while and
it's just again this this thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: happens that's independent to the show
itself but just this gathering of people
[SPEAKER_06]: and again just to not go back to the
grateful dead thing but it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_06]: before the concert people sort of venue
it's getting ready for the show it's these
[SPEAKER_06]: these people who are in line who are are
here for the show but they're psyched to
[SPEAKER_06]: be getting ready for the show getting
ready for the show is sometimes more fun
[SPEAKER_08]: than the show itself well it takes a lot
longer when you're traveling from like the
[SPEAKER_08]: center of Canada and driving to some venue
on the east coast and you had to get
[SPEAKER_08]: tickets and you had to cross a border and
you had to like break down and get pulled
[SPEAKER_08]: over by cops and almost busted and then
you got ripped off but then you got good
[SPEAKER_08]: weed and then you ended up at the concert
venue but you had a flat tire but then you
[SPEAKER_08]: found some grilled cheeses you ate some
mushrooms you ended up in the venue the
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking show was killer and let's do it
all over again tomorrow yeah you know I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know if you listen mark but uh every
day on the grateful dead xm channel
[SPEAKER_06]: there's uh today in grateful dead history
and and the archivist is my friend david
[SPEAKER_06]: the mute who is a fellow canadian from bc
in fact he lives not too far from where
[SPEAKER_06]: you're at marcus he's a really cool guy he
fishes but he's he's like he's really into
[SPEAKER_06]: again just keeping the archive of the
great full dead and he's on every day and
[SPEAKER_06]: so for those of us who listen to the xm
channel we listen the great full dead
[SPEAKER_06]: stories from him every day and he's always
got that whole you know thing about how to
[SPEAKER_06]: cross the border how to navigate the
border and go to these you know ultra
[SPEAKER_06]: psychedelic crazy events and still come
back to society and re-assimilate back to
[SPEAKER_08]: canada you know yeah i've listened to him
as well i love his stories and uh those
[SPEAKER_08]: those are they're just yeah they're
they're classic and they're great because
[SPEAKER_08]: we relate to them you know the easiest i
ever got over the border here in british
[SPEAKER_08]: columbia by far because i'd been trying
and trying and trying and just constantly
[SPEAKER_08]: getting denied but when fish came up and i
can't remember if it was like 96 or seven
[SPEAKER_08]: or eight but one of those years i was just
like i was at the show i was like kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: tripping and it was just like everyone was
like all right man we're going you know
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like we gotta go back we gotta go
portland's tomorrow you know like i'm like
[SPEAKER_08]: all right well you know what i'm fucking
coming and i just got in my car and drove
[SPEAKER_08]: with this procession of freaks and at the
time i looked really like the least amount
[SPEAKER_08]: of a freak and i was in a brand new rental
car so i i wanted to tell you i got
[SPEAKER_08]: through there so quick every single person
that was at that show that was wearing
[SPEAKER_08]: patchwork clothes and dreaded out and like
just super flying their freak flag they
[SPEAKER_08]: were all pulled over when i drove through
i could see them all getting torn apart by
[SPEAKER_08]: their vans none of them cared because
they're all americans anyway and they
[SPEAKER_08]: can't be denied into their country but i'm
the canadian and i can be denied into the
[SPEAKER_08]: country i don't really care about being
denied into america other than the fact
[SPEAKER_08]: that i really want to see the show
tomorrow in portland you know from the
[SPEAKER_08]: actual venue not from someone's uh
recording like a month later so that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what it's up for me the whole fucking
border hold down is just such a bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: bullshit man it's just it is it's a it's a
bummer for sure it's definitely a bummer
[SPEAKER_08]: for us to have between our two countries
we were talking about it the other day how
[SPEAKER_08]: great a country from like the tip of
alaska you know maybe down to like
[SPEAKER_08]: guatemala or venezuela or something just
have a west coast country we've all
[SPEAKER_08]: dreamed about it in the past no borders
you know get elon to build some crazy
[SPEAKER_08]: tubes that just we can blast down there in
like four hours or whatever going 600
[SPEAKER_08]: miles an hour that would be pretty sweet
but uh you know we got what we got got to
[SPEAKER_08]: do got to do the best we can with what we
have and uh it doesn't stop us from
[SPEAKER_08]: dreaming because uh had we not been
dreaming all these years i'm certain that
[SPEAKER_08]: my company wouldn't have been signing uh
contracts with provinces for hash uh
[SPEAKER_08]: supply and i'm sure that uh etienne
wouldn't still be doing what he's been
[SPEAKER_08]: doing for the last uh you know 20 to 30
years and many others so clearly the
[SPEAKER_06]: things that we've been doing
congratulations on that mark i know that
[SPEAKER_06]: that's no easy feat and being able to you
know get your product into the you know uh
[SPEAKER_06]: masses uh you know or at least having that
ability to grow that market share is just
[SPEAKER_06]: an unbelievable opportunity but remember
what they always say be careful what you
[SPEAKER_06]: wish for now a lot of people need your
hash and it's like whoa i mean when you
[SPEAKER_06]: scale up production to say one to say like
multiple kilograms it's one thing but when
[SPEAKER_06]: you're now doing that at hundreds of
kilograms that is just yeah that's off to
[SPEAKER_08]: you and a responsibility like you said
it's a responsibility it's not just about
[SPEAKER_08]: supplying one time it's about supplying
and then consistently supplying and making
[SPEAKER_08]: sure that you're taking care of both your
medical patients and your rec market
[SPEAKER_08]: because i do see you know some
difficulties in having both of those
[SPEAKER_08]: markets i see a lot of companies kind of
go like just right right to rec med can be
[SPEAKER_08]: difficult you have to deal with patients
there's all these other things and i feel
[SPEAKER_08]: like i don't like the idea of the med
patients getting the short end of the
[SPEAKER_08]: stick on all of that so it's definitely a
discussion and it's something that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to pay attention to we want to make
sure that uh that everyone has access
[SPEAKER_06]: compliant mark like is it is it going to
be gmp compliant if it's not there it
[SPEAKER_08]: looks gmp eventually absolutely eventually
we've got gmp consultants that we speak
[SPEAKER_08]: with on the regular and it's definitely
you know gmp serious business it's great
[SPEAKER_08]: to get into that pharmaceutical market and
into you know markets like germany and and
[SPEAKER_08]: parts of europe like that but at the same
time you know you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: needing a runway to create a gmp facility
the costs are so over the top they're
[SPEAKER_08]: already over the top with our you know i
don't want to say over regulated industry
[SPEAKER_08]: but it is it is very regulated i think we
look at it as way over regulated because
[SPEAKER_08]: of how under regulated our food and our
water and our air tends to be people are
[SPEAKER_08]: just so it's so easy to poison either of
those three things and you can profit off
[SPEAKER_08]: that poisoning substantially and so people
in the cannabis industry are kind of like
[SPEAKER_08]: why do we have to be so regulated and it's
kind of like you know what don't worry
[SPEAKER_08]: about it it's good for the patients on
that sense we don't need to be over
[SPEAKER_08]: regulated from the perspective of
packaging and all that bullshit but when
[SPEAKER_08]: it comes to the overregulations of
certificate of analysis making sure we
[SPEAKER_08]: test being extremely extremely sensitive
about what if any pesticides or fungicides
[SPEAKER_08]: are are being allowed and all of that sort
of thing i love the sort of overregulated
[SPEAKER_08]: uh that side of it i dislike the
overregulated aspect of you know some of
[SPEAKER_08]: the rest of it that comes into play where
you just get painted into these corners
[SPEAKER_08]: and you just got to you know do your best
to uh to to get out of those corners and
[SPEAKER_08]: uh you know to create this thing that has
not been yet created it's it's just still
[SPEAKER_08]: scaling up it's just still happening so i
would like to tip my hat off truly to all
[SPEAKER_08]: the companies both in the u.s and canada
that have managed to get products to the
[SPEAKER_08]: market it really is a long and winding
road um but it's worthwhile sticking to it
[SPEAKER_06]: marcus could i ask a question so when
you're when you're using all that water
[SPEAKER_06]: are you are you recovering anything from
your water because i would assume again
[SPEAKER_06]: part of your gmp would be to try to you
know again standardize a process to make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that you're getting everything that
you need to get and i would also just
[SPEAKER_06]: think from a a sanitary point of view
sending hash water down the sink may not
[SPEAKER_06]: be the most you know best you know route
for its sanitation so is what what can you
[SPEAKER_06]: comment on like the discharge of your
water well we're definitely looking at it
[SPEAKER_08]: you know we're building a quiver as you
know so the whole purpose of embark was to
[SPEAKER_08]: build a quiver so when i when i started
the company with my partners part of me
[SPEAKER_08]: was wanting to stick with my ego and be
like you know what i'm the solventless guy
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's what we're gonna this is gonna
be all about bubble and that's what we're
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna do because that's all i've been
doing and i i sort of thought of these
[SPEAKER_08]: different conversations i've had i think
of my relationship with dr mark i think of
[SPEAKER_08]: my relationship with mike west some of my
you know chemist friends that understand
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's just chemistry and it's just
molecules and chemicals are everywhere and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything and that sort of helped me to
the point where it was like you know what
[SPEAKER_08]: if we're going to build this company i
don't mind having a big solventless
[SPEAKER_08]: division but i really believe the quiver
is going to be important and it comes into
[SPEAKER_08]: importance with your question when you
start deciding look how are you going to
[SPEAKER_08]: recover the say the terpenes or the
phenols out of your waters after you've
[SPEAKER_08]: washed it is there anything that you can
do for that if you've got a solventless
[SPEAKER_08]: setup that's going to be a little bit more
difficult but if you've got a seven
[SPEAKER_08]: modalities of extraction you've got co2
and hydrocarbons and ethanol and dual
[SPEAKER_08]: solvents and terpene extraction and salt
dry sift rosin and bubble hash now you
[SPEAKER_08]: have these modalities that you would
require so we are setting things up so
[SPEAKER_08]: certain things that happen in the
solventless room that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_08]: just discharge out can be saved and
eventually go over to that other you know
[SPEAKER_08]: side of things so things like pressing
rosin bags things like you know not
[SPEAKER_08]: wanting to put the 220 into your final
product but it's 40 percent or 30 percent
[SPEAKER_08]: you know it's it's contaminated but it
still has resin in it you know the cut the
[SPEAKER_08]: client doesn't want it mixed into their a
or b grade but we don't want to throw it
[SPEAKER_08]: out so all of these little things we're
definitely thinking consciously and we
[SPEAKER_08]: definitely don't want to be just talking
and tossing things away unnecessarily
[SPEAKER_08]: because we understand the value of the
plant so we're working on it is the best
[SPEAKER_08]: answer I can give you and I'll explain my
answers with embark like I did on my live
[SPEAKER_08]: show yesterday because we're going to go
public eventually because I'm a founder
[SPEAKER_08]: because I'm a deep part of this company
and because we're so regulated in Canada I
[SPEAKER_08]: have to be very careful with what I say
and don't say and my problem is I don't
[SPEAKER_08]: know really what I can't say and so I've
always been so transparent and so open
[SPEAKER_08]: with everything you know my partners are
like don't like please just like be
[SPEAKER_08]: careful and so obviously I don't want to
put my company at risk or my license at
[SPEAKER_08]: risk but we are making way to become more
and more transparent without putting our
[SPEAKER_08]: license at risk so that's all I'll say
about that but congratulations to the
[SPEAKER_08]: whole team at embark they have been
kicking ass taking names and kicking ass
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus a great trick that I have found is
you take a lawyer and then you transplant
[SPEAKER_10]: them into your hip so that everywhere you
go you have somebody who's making sure
[SPEAKER_10]: you're safe so I might go for a lawyer hip
transplant for your own protection for
[SPEAKER_08]: embark is what I'm suggesting you know
dude I know that's like funny but I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: seriously considering it well it is funny
but it isn't because I decide I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: saying anything you know I mean it's
difficult especially when you have an
[SPEAKER_06]: online you know show like ash church and
and you know people know you as being such
[SPEAKER_06]: a great resource for information and and
it's it's difficult to say no I've had to
[SPEAKER_06]: do that too Marcus it's like impossible
because because the the community is so
[SPEAKER_06]: hungry for information you know and and
they'll come to you with such passion and
[SPEAKER_06]: want to know everything and you can't
always divulge everything because part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the value you're capturing for for embark
is for yeah a group of investors well
[SPEAKER_08]: that's just it and you give away so much
that you really create a level and I mean
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had this happen with my own friends
that where they've become so entitled
[SPEAKER_08]: because I've been giving them so much that
they now actually expect for me to give
[SPEAKER_08]: them certain things and it's had it's I've
had difficulties with friendships forget
[SPEAKER_08]: about like complete and total strangers
with just an entitlement that says you
[SPEAKER_08]: need to show me this or to tell me this
I'm like listen like please understand my
[SPEAKER_08]: position like try to have empathy for me
I'm not evil I'm not trying to keep things
[SPEAKER_08]: from people but my goodness if you're
truly my friend you would have an
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding of where I'm coming from and
understand that it's not to keep things
[SPEAKER_08]: you know it's that I'm I've created a
situation for myself and now it's my my
[SPEAKER_06]: responsibility to navigate it well and
know that whatever is shared on Ash Church
[SPEAKER_08]: is patented by Sam already well that's it
he's got the pen and paper there and he's
[SPEAKER_08]: just patenting away it's wonderful I did
see recently that Nextleaf released a
[SPEAKER_08]: patent for water extraction and I'm very
excited to see what is going to go on with
[SPEAKER_08]: that talk about previously published art
there's already been a patent that's
[SPEAKER_08]: existed from Reinhart Delft from 1997 till
1990 or 2018 I believe his patent number
[SPEAKER_08]: you have the patent number you could share
with me I could find it for you real soon
[SPEAKER_08]: by just punching in Nextleaf so everybody
out there you know like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: have been asking me about patents because
I got a couple and you always have to look
[SPEAKER_06]: at the most the key thing in the patent
always look at claim number one claim
[SPEAKER_06]: number one claim number one is what
they're claiming that's usually like their
[SPEAKER_06]: main thing and if you look and if you can
figure out a way around claim one well
[SPEAKER_06]: then it's probably not going to hold up
and there's still no precedent in the
[SPEAKER_06]: United States for cannabis based patents
to hold up in an infringement case against
[SPEAKER_06]: it so there's still a lot of questions
about whether or not you want to patent
[SPEAKER_06]: anything at all you know why would you do
that there's a lawsuit now right between
[SPEAKER_06]: GW Pharmaceutical and Canopy I think right
I think I heard about this on the BizCon
[SPEAKER_06]: thing but if memory serves me correctly
people have been using CO2 extraction for
[SPEAKER_06]: botanicals for a long time so where is the
invention on using it for cannabis I don't
[SPEAKER_08]: know okay well someone patented it someone
patented it a long time ago Mike West was
[SPEAKER_08]: the one telling me about this and he sold
it for ten dollars and one percent and
[SPEAKER_08]: Canopy bought that patent by buying a
bunch of companies up that happened to
[SPEAKER_08]: hold that CO2 patent and like anything I
think most people were just because it was
[SPEAKER_08]: patented a while ago it's an older patent
and so I guess you know people were like
[SPEAKER_08]: well there's no value to that and then
Canopy bought it and kind of some lawyer
[SPEAKER_08]: probably saw it in their portfolio and was
like holy shit like let's look into this
[SPEAKER_08]: and yeah I wish Mike West was around
because he has a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: information am I missing something there
are companies that sell CO2 extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: machines oh I know people out there doing
CO2 extraction well think of think of how
[SPEAKER_05]: many people to one company think of how
many people were making using water to
[SPEAKER_06]: make coffee is proprietary to mr.
[SPEAKER_08]: coffee or agreed I'm a hundred percent in
agreeance I felt like at the first time
[SPEAKER_08]: around when I was in my lawsuit with
Reinhard Delp and found myself for five
[SPEAKER_08]: years in the lawsuit because I was selling
bubble bags teaching people how to make
[SPEAKER_08]: water hash and here's this guy saying well
I patented that in 1997 before I showed
[SPEAKER_08]: Mila you know which I guess Mila maybe
didn't know because she showed the process
[SPEAKER_08]: to Mark Rose and Eldon a couple of days
later and they were sitting there looking
[SPEAKER_08]: at it and Eldon was like two five gallon
shaped nylon bags with screen bottoms and
[SPEAKER_08]: you've got the same thing Mark Rose is
sitting there call going it's the it's the
[SPEAKER_08]: isolator it's using ice to isolate it's
the ice oh later he named the product he
[SPEAKER_08]: manufactured the product Eldon invented
the product Mila sold the product and
[SPEAKER_08]: that's really was the beginning of
Reinhard Delp you know kind of losing
[SPEAKER_08]: control of his of his market cap I came
along tried to sell isolator bags it
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't work out so we made our own with
extra bags and extra screens and that
[SPEAKER_08]: became bubble bags and that's how I ended
up in a nice little five-year lawsuit with
[SPEAKER_08]: Reinhard Delp happily paid him six figures
out which I was very happy to do because
[SPEAKER_08]: that was the honest right thing to do Mila
was kind of trying to portray that she was
[SPEAKER_08]: the one that got screwed in reality it was
Reinhard Delp who got screwed and I made
[SPEAKER_08]: sure that he got paid for that and that I
paid for him for royalties for the entire
[SPEAKER_08]: time my company was alive from 1999 right
off into the future so I felt pretty good
[SPEAKER_08]: about that but it is interesting how the
history can be rewritten for a very long
[SPEAKER_08]: time nobody knew Reinhardt was involved
whatsoever they just thought of me as a
[SPEAKER_08]: guy that came along and stole the isolator
idea I would also like to say that I took
[SPEAKER_08]: care of Eldon by giving him free tickets
to the legends of hash parties and I also
[SPEAKER_08]: took on Mark Rose as my manufacturer the
very same guy who named isolator bags and
[SPEAKER_08]: and manufactured them he ended up hitting
me up a couple years later because I guess
[SPEAKER_08]: Mila decided to get Turkish immigrants to
make the bags instead of the Nepali people
[SPEAKER_08]: that were doing it in Nepal with Mark Rose
he felt a little screwed that pushed him
[SPEAKER_08]: over to my camp and we've been working
happily ever since for about 20 plus years
[SPEAKER_08]: so there's a little history of water
extraction for you right there maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: there'll be new history 20 years from now
with people like next leaf and their
[SPEAKER_08]: patents I don't know how it plays out mark
but I'll tell you patent court is
[SPEAKER_08]: terrifying you think that it's going to
play out one way but it never does and the
[SPEAKER_08]: judge can lean any way he wants and you
can still end up burning hundreds of
[SPEAKER_08]: thousands of dollars in the courts you
know with the case over years so my advice
[SPEAKER_08]: is that companies get together they work
things out don't bring lawyers into it
[SPEAKER_08]: because they are the ones that will come
they're the ones that will take your money
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're they're almost like secret
partners on both sides of the table they
[SPEAKER_08]: want to be difficult back and forth
because that's where they make their money
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately also only lasts for 20 years
and then you have no protection exactly
[SPEAKER_08]: well well said Sam that is a big big big
big deal and it's it's something that I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't think a lot of people pay attention
to now I'm certain there is methodologies
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe dr. Mark knows where you can extend
patents by filing paperwork and doing
[SPEAKER_08]: certain things depending on the situation
I could be wrong but yeah yeah so what
[SPEAKER_06]: happens is is when you file a patent
sometimes you file very very broadly and
[SPEAKER_06]: when the patent office gets it they
basically divide it into what are called
[SPEAKER_06]: divisional patents and those patents are
individually prosecuted and will grant
[SPEAKER_06]: individually so like for example like with
the hydrogenation they recognize that
[SPEAKER_06]: there were multiple inventions there there
was a process there is the composition
[SPEAKER_06]: there was the you know a method to control
tumor growth there's various claims that
[SPEAKER_06]: you could make and each of those claims in
and of itself can become its own issued
[SPEAKER_06]: patent and so as certain claims are easy
to get because there's no prior art like
[SPEAKER_06]: composition of matter HHCA for example
there was no HHCA until we disclosed it so
[SPEAKER_06]: that was an easy you know patent to get it
was easy to get that one but other things
[SPEAKER_06]: where we had HHCA combination with other
cannabinoids well the other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_06]: were known so now you're talking about
having to evaluate the prior art which is
[SPEAKER_06]: relevant here versus not relevant in the
other easy to get cases so you're easy to
[SPEAKER_06]: get cases or they're the first cases that
are going to issue but then what you do is
[SPEAKER_06]: you file what's called a continuation in
part and the continuation in part is still
[SPEAKER_06]: the original patent date when you
originally filed and you're just basically
[SPEAKER_06]: adding claims on to that patent without
changing the body or the description of
[SPEAKER_06]: the patent you could add additional claims
and keep on getting those as continued
[SPEAKER_06]: issued that basically extends the lifetime
because every time you get an issued
[SPEAKER_06]: patent that's another 20 years 20 years 20
years 20 years right I don't know why we
[SPEAKER_06]: don't respect sorry go ahead no I was
gonna stop by just saying in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry it's likely that you know a lot
of the you know sort of secret things that
[SPEAKER_06]: are done can be can be the form of
intellectual property rather than a patent
[SPEAKER_06]: would be something called a trade secret
so a trade secret is kind of like the
[SPEAKER_06]: recipe to make coca cola right the six
ingredients coca cola are printed on the
[SPEAKER_06]: side of coca cola can right so everyone
sees what the ingredients are the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: magic is is the recipe and how to make it
right so that's usually like most of like
[SPEAKER_06]: like if you're taking proprietary genetics
and doing some type of you know either a
[SPEAKER_06]: solvent-less extraction or solvent-based
extraction but making a particular like a
[SPEAKER_06]: live resin or rosin or a particular
product that could be made reproducibly
[SPEAKER_06]: time and time again and mark you know the
whole premise of gmp good manufacturing
[SPEAKER_06]: practices is being able to do something
consistently time and time again and when
[SPEAKER_06]: I say consistently again with cannabis
things change so you have to basically set
[SPEAKER_06]: an error bar or and understand a tolerance
of what your product specifications are so
[SPEAKER_06]: if it has this much mercy it meets
specification but if there's not enough
[SPEAKER_06]: mercy it doesn't mean specifications right
and it could go on to basically be another
[SPEAKER_06]: product turn that stuff into distillate or
something but you know gmp is is again
[SPEAKER_06]: it's in all the other industries for food
ingredients for the ingredients that we
[SPEAKER_06]: use in our medicine for the ingredients we
use in the cosmetics and personal care
[SPEAKER_06]: product industries so these are all the
adjacent industries that were basically
[SPEAKER_06]: already using good manufacturing practices
now this will spill over into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and it's just really good to see
because again when you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: small-scale hash production you can see
the nuances of how this thing could come
[SPEAKER_06]: out very very different even on a small
scale so imagine now committing you know
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of thousands of grams or liters
now you're talking about you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: material being processed at any one
particular time so trust me I know it well
[SPEAKER_08]: it's terrifying there's very very small
numbers like if you get a skew it's got to
[SPEAKER_08]: be between this percentage of of thc
they're not thank god they're not doing it
[SPEAKER_08]: with terpenes yet like oh you don't have
enough mercy and that fails it's like but
[SPEAKER_08]: if you put something into your skew that
falls below or goes above your thc
[SPEAKER_08]: percentage you know you can't sell it
under that skew anymore you'd have to
[SPEAKER_08]: either make a new skew or you'd have to
have another skew made that it fits into
[SPEAKER_08]: or and so you have to do all of these
these different things it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_08]: very complex system but at the same time
this is all we wanted for the longest time
[SPEAKER_08]: stop segregating us let us assimilate into
society let cannabis be a part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: world and a big part of that this is what
comes along with it like of course if it's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be a big part of the world and
it's not going to be segregated into the
[SPEAKER_08]: closet anymore well then it's going to be
like everything else in the world and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: going to fall into all of those other sort
of you know modalities which is like yeah
[SPEAKER_08]: we have to do this properly it has to be
like I know you've been doing this for 30
[SPEAKER_08]: years and it's been fine and safe but it's
like we do this for your medicine we do
[SPEAKER_08]: this for your food and we're going to do
it with with cannabis as well so thank
[SPEAKER_08]: goodness that will never you know for me
as long as they never take away the
[SPEAKER_08]: ability for us to grow recreationally and
grow medically so anyone that wants to put
[SPEAKER_08]: the time and the energy can still access
cannabis and the resins exactly the way
[SPEAKER_08]: they want but on the flip side for the
other 80 plus percent of the population
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's probably higher they should be
able to go and buy it like they do their
[SPEAKER_08]: milk and their pasta and anything else and
when they buy that they should be ensured
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's been created safely and that
it's not going to have a bunch of a bunch
[SPEAKER_08]: of crap in because you would not believe
the awareness you need to have to set up a
[SPEAKER_08]: hash facility to make hash to make sure
nothing in that room is shedding nothing
[SPEAKER_08]: is releasing or chipping or you know
contaminating your final product and I
[SPEAKER_08]: can't tell you where I've seen that in
different labs I've seen it in in things
[SPEAKER_08]: that you could not possibly imagine you
know putting putting your books down on
[SPEAKER_08]: top of a deep freezer and then the deep
freezer slowly chipping and releasing
[SPEAKER_08]: paint you know box cutters that instead of
plastic bodies have metal bodies that have
[SPEAKER_08]: been painted yellow and red and black and
every time you put those down they chip
[SPEAKER_08]: little bits of paint I've seen this in
labs before so once you become that crazy
[SPEAKER_08]: person in the lab running the facility and
keeping all of this stuff from happening
[SPEAKER_08]: you just can't believe how easy it is for
microbials and for contaminations that
[SPEAKER_08]: shed off of different things to that you
know that you're trying to keep out you
[SPEAKER_08]: become the ultimate goaltender you're just
trying to keep this stuff out and it
[SPEAKER_08]: becomes a real challenge the bigger you
get and the higher up you scale yeah I
[SPEAKER_14]: agree Marcus that I went through that here
in the state of Massachusetts where I got
[SPEAKER_14]: so wild with it that I I had to look at
the air filters because I was finding
[SPEAKER_14]: things that were falling instead of
settling and I looked at our height off
[SPEAKER_14]: rotovap one day coming in from the solvent
in the side and I just like wiped on it
[SPEAKER_14]: and I was like that's in my hat yeah
that's it right here you know we've been
[SPEAKER_14]: scoping this thing for like a while this
is before we even released anything we
[SPEAKER_14]: just we narrowed everything down and
really cut all the the different nuances
[SPEAKER_14]: out to really just get the room clean and
I mean I mean as as clean like eat off the
[SPEAKER_14]: floor clean you know oh yeah hospital
clean possibly exactly hospital clean and
[SPEAKER_14]: that's how we that's how I operate and I
know that's you how you operate a market
[SPEAKER_14]: because it's you have to be that in tune
with your it's not only your tools but
[SPEAKER_14]: it's all for your environment it's the
things you bring into your environment the
[SPEAKER_14]: things that you're wearing during your
during the time you're in your environment
[SPEAKER_14]: and they all play a major role in how your
end product really comes out because that
[SPEAKER_14]: we don't have these solvents and these
these vessels to to keep this stuff
[SPEAKER_14]: contained we very much deal with a lot of
still what I call the elements even when
[SPEAKER_06]: we're inside so totally well that when you
see that the company like Marcus's has
[SPEAKER_06]: made the commitment to gowning every
employee and every employee in there has
[SPEAKER_06]: got booties on and their gown from head to
toe and a guy like me fuzzy beardy guy
[SPEAKER_06]: like me ah that's completely all covered
up I'm completely covered up here you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't want to get any one bit of
contamination into those rooms and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: it and the thing is is like when you look
at when you look at GMP facilities you can
[SPEAKER_06]: tell because they have to be cleaned from
from from floor to ceiling any horizontal
[SPEAKER_06]: surface that can collect dust so you can
imagine like some of your labs you see
[SPEAKER_06]: where they have like venting coming in or
there's ductwork coming in or there's
[SPEAKER_06]: electrical shit hanging from the ceiling
that doesn't work in GMP that's all got to
[SPEAKER_06]: be enclosed it all has to be basically
stainless steel bleach fucking clean like
[SPEAKER_06]: it there's no there's no compromise in any
horizontal surface like if you have like I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know like let's say you just have
like a conduit that comes through your lab
[SPEAKER_06]: and basically there's a you have to have a
procedure on how to clean that surface and
[SPEAKER_06]: a record of how often that surface is
clean because that surface could be the
[SPEAKER_14]: source of contamination down below you're
so right and and it's you have to get that
[SPEAKER_14]: detailed mark and and that's unbelievable
like Marcus said we all wanted this for
[SPEAKER_14]: years I mean this is I'm excited to have
these challenges it makes me better for it
[SPEAKER_14]: and it makes our process better for it and
allows us to look at different parts of
[SPEAKER_14]: the process in ways that we might not
otherwise look at it let's pass on some
[SPEAKER_08]: value to our to our viewers right now
because there is one thing I can give you
[SPEAKER_08]: that I came across that I decided was not
going to happen in my lab and it might it
[SPEAKER_08]: might surprise a bunch of people because I
see people customizing these I see people
[SPEAKER_08]: doing this all the time and it's a
conversation I've wanted to bring up for a
[SPEAKER_08]: while and this is of course the the cozies
that are placed on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_08]: buckets on the outside of the washers on
the outside of the 65 gallon stainless
[SPEAKER_08]: steel tubs that pure pressure sells these
although can be cleaned unless you have
[SPEAKER_08]: someone who understands the SOPs and
protocols of a GMP facility they will
[SPEAKER_08]: never get those things cleaned properly
and if you simply do a swatch test on your
[SPEAKER_08]: cozies that are sitting on the outside of
your buckets you will find the microbial
[SPEAKER_08]: content is high higher than you want it to
be and absolutely a vector for potential
[SPEAKER_08]: contamination in your final product you're
folding your bags over top of that cozy
[SPEAKER_08]: and your bags are touching that cozy that
is continually soaking turp rich water in
[SPEAKER_08]: day after day after day after day if you
don't think that is a breeding ground for
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial content you have not been
thinking correctly do me a favor rip those
[SPEAKER_08]: cozies off if you're in a proper lab right
now it's they're unnecessary they do not
[SPEAKER_08]: keep your buckets colder you can just put
a little bit of more ice in it really
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't make a huge difference when you
pull them off versus the potential of
[SPEAKER_08]: contaminant that is there to contaminate
your final end product to me that's
[SPEAKER_06]: something I would get rid of ASAP Marcus
that's such a great suggestion I've always
[SPEAKER_06]: thought about that that was a point of
contamination did they start to smell like
[SPEAKER_06]: after a while like because if they're
absorbing water and they're like drying
[SPEAKER_06]: out absorbing water dry out do they start
to smell after a while they would
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely now keep in mind we were
cleaning ours like crazy but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_08]: well with with special cleaning like
detergents that you could clean we also
[SPEAKER_08]: used iso on the outside but it wouldn't
soak in they're very thick so to me I just
[SPEAKER_08]: like the idea of getting rid of them they
don't help they're not all they are as a
[SPEAKER_08]: vector for potential contamination and
that's my opinion but it's a gift to
[SPEAKER_08]: anyone listening today because you know if
you would just want to avoid a potential
[SPEAKER_08]: and if you don't believe me start doing
swab tests on it you can get swab kits you
[SPEAKER_08]: can swab your your everything in your room
for microbial content and you and you
[SPEAKER_08]: should be doing this and having these
things tested because if you were you
[SPEAKER_10]: would probably be ripping those cozies off
ASAP so scum and I know that you're a big
[SPEAKER_10]: dry sift I know we're talking water here
but you know we were talking patents so
[SPEAKER_10]: when does your dry sift patent expire so
that you can share your dry sift secrets
[SPEAKER_04]: with the rest of us it is not a patent
it's a proprietary information it's called
[SPEAKER_04]: a trade secret it's the coca-cola recipe
but if you tell a few key people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: universe and I told them once I'm dead
they're free to do whatever they want with
[SPEAKER_04]: the information but don't hold your breath
because I ain't going nowhere exactly and
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam I can concur you did absolutely say
exactly that to me and I have held that
[SPEAKER_08]: respect and I've had people be pissed at
me for for being loyal to a mentor and a
[SPEAKER_08]: friend if you can imagine which is fine
I'm the those people play their cards
[SPEAKER_08]: early on I'm loyal I'm loyal when someone
asks and it's not mine to tell them it's
[SPEAKER_08]: yours it's yours it's not you didn't give
it to me you showed me and you told me
[SPEAKER_08]: that if when I pass away you can share it
until then keep it keep it to yourself
[SPEAKER_08]: which I have absolutely done I don't use
the process at my company I've never shown
[SPEAKER_08]: the process to anyone but it sure is it's
an eye opener we have asked and you were
[SPEAKER_08]: like no and I respect it's like actually
even further John I asked you guys not to
[SPEAKER_08]: ask me anymore is what I actually asked
because I felt like I said this I said do
[SPEAKER_08]: you really want to trick me out of this do
you really want to get me into a
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation and trick me out of something
that my that my mentor this person I have
[SPEAKER_08]: so much respect for that I that you can't
imagine the the joy and pride I had when
[SPEAKER_08]: he showed that to me and it wasn't because
I was gonna be learning something that
[SPEAKER_08]: nobody knew it was because that that man
decided to trust me and you think I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna let that go you think I'm gonna like
let that trust go I wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that the information was available to
mankind if I wasn't able to mechanicalize
[SPEAKER_04]: it like I would wanted to I want to
automate the system but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be able to or not so but one day lots
of people can make pretty damn good dry
[SPEAKER_04]: sips nowadays so there may be not making
99.9 but they're making 95 pretty easy the
[SPEAKER_14]: varieties are getting better too so you
know they sure are doesn't be easier to
[SPEAKER_14]: collect and you know with with that said
you think Mark and even Sam do you think
[SPEAKER_14]: utility patents are something that could
could hold up because they're nuances of
[SPEAKER_04]: just processes I mean what do you think
about that utility patent does not last as
[SPEAKER_14]: long as I held this secret right I agree
now what if you have what if you're one of
[SPEAKER_06]: those guys like you know I think if you're
trying to raise money and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: build perceived value filing patents could
be a way of sort of I mean think of a
[SPEAKER_06]: patent is like a picket and a picket fence
and a patent in and of itself is not as
[SPEAKER_06]: valuable as getting a bunch of patents to
kind of like secure your little
[SPEAKER_06]: intellectual property island but like Sam
was saying you know the trade secret in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is really I mean like there are
successful products out there and they
[SPEAKER_06]: have successful you know the genesis of
the idea of how they're made and how
[SPEAKER_06]: they're put together and the notion that
you want to protect that well if you file
[SPEAKER_06]: again not a utility but a process patent
it's difficult because your competitors
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't necessarily going to let you into
their facility to know that their process
[SPEAKER_06]: infringes on your process you can buy
their product in the store and you can do
[SPEAKER_06]: some type of analysis but at the end of
the day they're tracking THC or THC or CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever cannabinoid and it's in a
product okay well I mean those methods
[SPEAKER_06]: have been around for a long time so
there's nothing really new about that I
[SPEAKER_06]: guess the companies who are filing who are
coming out with new extraction processes
[SPEAKER_06]: or machines that are particular for their
process so in order to run their process
[SPEAKER_06]: to make that kind of product you have to
buy their machine so of course they want
[SPEAKER_06]: to patent that machine because they want
to be the only machine manufacturer that
[SPEAKER_06]: can make that particular thing I haven't
really seen that too much in cannabis I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean mostly a lot of these extracts are
you know is as good as the extraction
[SPEAKER_06]: method and you know a lot of the whether
you're doing solvent-based or not you know
[SPEAKER_06]: solvent-less you know the thing that we've
always said here on Hash Church which is
[SPEAKER_06]: you need high quality plant material
that's not contaminated and if it starts
[SPEAKER_06]: with high quality plant material and your
extraction method is proper you should get
[SPEAKER_06]: a very proper extract yeah I concur with
that you know I've gone through a great
[SPEAKER_14]: deal of material this past year alone and
I've seen varying sizes of types of
[SPEAKER_14]: quality and yields and at the end of the
day we have a specific target to make full
[SPEAKER_14]: melt and there's things that we need to
you always have to adapt to and it's about
[SPEAKER_14]: it does become about your process as well
as the material but there is there
[SPEAKER_14]: actually like you're saying there is a
there's more sides to it it's not as black
[SPEAKER_14]: and white as as you know as just the
material versus the process I think more
[SPEAKER_08]: people need to focus on actually growing
quality cannabis because the bottom line
[SPEAKER_08]: is if you haven't even grown great
cannabis the process is none of these
[SPEAKER_08]: processes are going to work for you I'd
also say that nothing's faster than
[SPEAKER_08]: large-scale water extraction for isolating
99.9% gland heads you all have had access
[SPEAKER_08]: to it for 20 plus years so what you just
think you're going to get access to this
[SPEAKER_08]: new thing and it's going to change your
world trust me the thing that will change
[SPEAKER_08]: your world is growing better weed focus on
that that is important I agree Marcus 100%
[SPEAKER_06]: like we were talking last week I mean
having testing that we we can test the
[SPEAKER_06]: material now and have methods to say okay
what is the impact and you know when you
[SPEAKER_06]: look at yield and so some of the work that
Johnny B did right here live on Hash
[SPEAKER_06]: Church looking at LED versus you know high
pressure sodium I mean where these things
[SPEAKER_06]: can actually have an incremental you know
impact on the quality of the material
[SPEAKER_06]: that's grown and again venues like Hash
Church and other online things by the way
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus speaking of online things I saw
your your curious about cannabis podcast
[SPEAKER_06]: very nice curious about cannabis podcast
that a podcast with Marcus you all should
[SPEAKER_06]: check it out it was great Marcus tells his
story but um you know there's so many
[SPEAKER_06]: things that I think that you can do like
you know the dragonfly earth medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: school of thought of regenerative cannabis
you know kind of like what we were talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about with with the guy from SC labs I'm
forgetting his name right now Alec right
[SPEAKER_06]: so having those analytical methods now not
only at the third party testing lab but at
[SPEAKER_06]: your production facility themselves where
you could actually follow the biomass
[SPEAKER_06]: you're getting into building you could
look at each individual fraction whether
[SPEAKER_06]: you're extracting and making distillate or
making some type of solventless product
[SPEAKER_06]: all these things can be tested now to look
at what the cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profiles are and translate that
information into stuff that you can put on
[SPEAKER_06]: the label that customers can actually pay
attention to so cool yeah absolutely I
[SPEAKER_08]: almost forgot about that podcast actually
um I haven't done that many lately but
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah I did tell the whole story on that
one for sure yeah that was cool Marcus you
[SPEAKER_06]: did a great job congratulations on that
that was great Jason's a nice guy we
[SPEAKER_06]: should get him on on Hash Church sometime
absolutely anytime you guys have people
[SPEAKER_08]: you want to invite on to Hash Church
please hit me up you guys are the core
[SPEAKER_08]: group I invite you all the time but I love
mixing it up new energy always creates new
[SPEAKER_08]: dialogue and new conversation doesn't
always work out as good as we'd like it to
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'm always down with taking the chance
even if it's just a matter of doing a sort
[SPEAKER_08]: of a little pre-Hash Church video with
people that we're thinking of bringing on
[SPEAKER_08]: it would be nice to to expand our hash
group core group here so yeah we should do
[SPEAKER_06]: that way to ask the question in the chat
here about Delta-8 you want me to chime in
[SPEAKER_06]: just for a second about Delta-8 for a
second?
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of interest in that these days yeah
absolutely are you guys sick of listening
[SPEAKER_06]: to me talk?
[SPEAKER_06]: no talking up bro yeah talk about so yeah
so remember like when Mishulim isolated
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-9 THC and the reason why we call it
Delta-9 is because when you look at the
[SPEAKER_06]: molecular structure of THC right this
thing that looks like chicken wire there's
[SPEAKER_06]: like three rings right and when you look
at the north ring you'll see that there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a double bond which is a carbon each one
of those angles is basically a carbon and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a double bond between two of the
carbons and where that double bond resides
[SPEAKER_06]: is the Delta-9 configuration in the plant
and Mishulim's method was so mild and
[SPEAKER_06]: isolating it that he didn't isomerize it
but previous researchers were frustrated
[SPEAKER_06]: because they were using acidic reagents
and other methods that were in the
[SPEAKER_06]: isolation of the active ingredient was
isomerizing the double bond and confused
[SPEAKER_06]: the ultimate stereochemical elucidation so
what what happens is if so think of it
[SPEAKER_06]: like this way so if you if you're looking
at the structure of THC that north ring
[SPEAKER_06]: the ring at the top most part of the
structure you see the double bond is
[SPEAKER_06]: pointed towards the phenolic portion of
the molecule which is where the benzene is
[SPEAKER_06]: right and so that's what's called the
Delta-9 configuration and Delta-9 would
[SPEAKER_06]: rather be in Delta-8 because when that
isomerizes it moves at one more carbon
[SPEAKER_06]: away from the rigid framework of the of
the benzene ring and when it moves it away
[SPEAKER_06]: it kind of lowers the energy of the
molecule so Delta-8 is lower by a few
[SPEAKER_06]: kilocalories in energy than Delta-9 so if
given the opportunity Delta-9 which is
[SPEAKER_06]: what the plant gives us goes to Delta-8
now the other reason why this is important
[SPEAKER_06]: is because again because CBD is a CBD can
be chemically converted into either
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-8 or Delta-9 THC right now a lot of
hemp producers because of the price of CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: has tanked you know CBD isolate is like
you know a year ago it was multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of dollars a kilogram now it's
just hundreds of dollars a kilogram so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's really tanked part of that is just
supply demand economics there's so much of
[SPEAKER_06]: it available the FDA has not given the
green light for food manufacturers to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to put this into food products so
there's a lot of production there's a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of it on the market so that basically puts
a downward pressure on the price of CBD so
[SPEAKER_06]: these manufacturers are looking to do
something to make some money so they're
[SPEAKER_06]: converting it over into Delta-8 now
Delta-8 is less psychoactive than Delta-9
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a couple different papers where
they look at the binding constant to the
[SPEAKER_06]: CB1 receptor but what I can tell you
universally is I've had some Delta-8 this
[SPEAKER_06]: way and it's it's heavy it gets you high
but I've never been kind of like knocked
[SPEAKER_06]: over bowled over like you do get like I
think on on THC I think you could actually
[SPEAKER_06]: noticeably feel the difference I don't
know if other people feel that way too but
[SPEAKER_06]: the last thing I'll say just about Delta-8
is that unfortunately it falls into the
[SPEAKER_06]: tetrahydrocannabinol code 7370 of the
controlled dangerous substance act to get
[SPEAKER_06]: that out which even though it was derived
from farmed illegal hemp you're now making
[SPEAKER_06]: an isomer that the DEA doesn't give a shit
where it came from they issued something
[SPEAKER_06]: called an interim final ruling about six
or eight months ago to try to harmonize
[SPEAKER_06]: the controlled dangerous substance act
with the farm bill just to let people know
[SPEAKER_06]: that you know THC and its isomers
including Delta-8 are all code 7370
[SPEAKER_06]: covered under the under controlled
dangerous substance act and again it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like quasi legal because you've you've
you've made the hemp and you've made the
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD from which it's derived legal right so
that's legal and people there's
[SPEAKER_06]: transactions that are happening where
people are buying and selling CBD hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass and people are actually smoking
flower check this out people are actually
[SPEAKER_06]: taking CBD isolate converting it to
Delta-8 and then spraying it back on hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: to make middies yeah it was like the world
needs more middies why you know but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting because again it's just it's
chemistry that actually Mishul described
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know we were mentioning patents
Mishul actually patented this but I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that this is sort of a gray area right now
Wade I don't really know whether or not
[SPEAKER_06]: you know the DEA has the muscle and the
enforcement to basically go after hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturers who are flying the you know
farm bill flag saying hey we're processing
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp it's below point three in THC when it
comes in the building how we process it
[SPEAKER_06]: we're we're processing it we're turning it
into products that the market wants a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the regulated Delta-9 markets those
people who have to pay through the
[SPEAKER_06]: eyeballs to get licenses and get
background checks on everyone and and do
[SPEAKER_06]: retinal scanners and have millions of
dollars they don't want the Delta-8
[SPEAKER_06]: industry to happen right because they're
gonna eat the market share they want these
[SPEAKER_06]: people to go to dispensary and buy their
licensed Delta-9 products so there's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be some kind of thing that's going to
happen going forward to try to harmonize
[SPEAKER_01]: these two things but that's for all and my
little so if I could what I'm hearing you
[SPEAKER_01]: say is that the amount of Delta-8 products
that are starting to show up across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country at this point it's really either
folks moving CBD into Delta-8
[SPEAKER_06]: isomerization or other aggressive yeah so
that or the the boys over at I think guild
[SPEAKER_06]: noticeably the guild extracts in
California but people who are using
[SPEAKER_06]: bleaching and decolorizing clays first
started noticing Delta-8 showing up in
[SPEAKER_06]: their distillates and some of the testing
labs and Alec would be great to comment on
[SPEAKER_06]: this we're like wait a second that's not
Delta-9 that's Delta-8 and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: beautifully clear distillate because the
bleaching clays there is no bleach there's
[SPEAKER_06]: no sodium hypochlorite they're just called
bleaching clays because they remove color
[SPEAKER_06]: and these are standard things that remove
color in the essential oils industry and
[SPEAKER_06]: soybean oil and vegetable oil all that
shit is decolorized and typically they use
[SPEAKER_06]: these type of bleaching clays which is
nothing more than montmorillonite clay but
[SPEAKER_06]: these clays are acidic enough such that
when they were adding clay to the
[SPEAKER_06]: distillation pot and then pooping over
what they thought was a Delta-9 distillate
[SPEAKER_06]: thermodynamics happened Delta-9 went down
to Delta-8 and it doesn't go back to
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-9 and so what they were getting was
Delta-8 clear distillate and they're like
[SPEAKER_06]: oh well we meant to make this so then they
became the Delta-8 company and talked
[SPEAKER_06]: about how we were making clear Delta-8
distillates so I think that that actually
[SPEAKER_06]: predated people using the acid catalyzed
process to convert CBD into Delta-8 which
[SPEAKER_06]: is now what you see mostly on the markets
I think are coming from hemp producers out
[SPEAKER_01]: west yeah the first time I ran into
Delta-8 in a test result was one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers was trying to clean up a
batch of cannabis that had I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: spinosad in it and he was doing a chlorine
bleach and yeah what we got back it had a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of Delta-8 and I couldn't find much
science at that point on how Delta-8
[SPEAKER_01]: affects patients again you know but I'm I
heard his reference earlier that you had
[SPEAKER_06]: seen some papers it feels like a THC would
but it feels less potent it just it
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't it doesn't quite do it for me but
I know some people love it and certainly
[SPEAKER_06]: like I guess if you're used to smoking
hemp flower and now you got hemp flowers
[SPEAKER_06]: sprayed with Delta-8 it just took a
circuitous way of getting back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: flower right thank you Mark Mark did you
know that for the last few years people
[SPEAKER_04]: have been marketing high CBD-8 cannabis
but the truth of it is as we both know
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis does not produce Delta-8 it's a
degradation product yeah I always thought
[SPEAKER_06]: that that was the case because if you look
at the biosynthetic pathway the way the
[SPEAKER_06]: molecule comes to from CBGA yeah it's an
it's an intramolecular cyclization and it
[SPEAKER_06]: makes one particular one particular um
configuration it would have a plant uh
[SPEAKER_04]: synthase that would use Delta-8 but it
does now it was really it was really
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting what we found and I think I
gave a talk on this at American Chemicals
[SPEAKER_06]: Society national meeting a couple years
ago which was we took Delta-9 THCA that
[SPEAKER_06]: was purified and we we actually isolated
the Delta-8 acid by isomerizing the
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta-9 over to Delta-8 without
decarboxylating it and so we had some
[SPEAKER_06]: analytical data that supported that so
that was kind of cool because there wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: really too many reports of that so but I I
agree with what you're saying I think only
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta-9 is what occurs in the plant you
had Delta-8A yes yes yeah cool isn't that
[SPEAKER_04]: cool it's way harder to find the Delta-8
yeah so I thought we were the first people
[SPEAKER_06]: to identify that but actually came to my
talk and pointed out that there was a a
[SPEAKER_06]: Roger Pertwee paper from a number of years
ago where he and Hanus had actually um
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrally characterized it so but it's
very it's buried in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_06]: tetrahedron letters paper from the middle
of the 80s you would not necessarily find
[SPEAKER_06]: it by looking for it but man there's a lot
of gems out there it's really cool I
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't even notice that Josh and Alec came
into the room so welcome to both of you
[SPEAKER_08]: and sorry for that for not welcoming you
right away please good morning everybody
[SPEAKER_12]: happy hash church happy hash church family
never want to interrupt a good
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation so that was super interesting
everybody good morning happy hash church
[SPEAKER_08]: good morning Kelly thank you for breaking
up this absolute sausage party it's uh we
[SPEAKER_08]: got to get more women in here there's
something bad about it we uh we appreciate
[SPEAKER_06]: you we appreciate you awesome Kelly can
you give me a favor Kelly yeah tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm important you are so important
Mark you don't even know it you know how
[SPEAKER_00]: important I feel that you are me too I
tell you that all the time I just like as
[SPEAKER_08]: important important but needy important
but needy that's it oh yeah lots of
[SPEAKER_08]: mansplaining going on you know I got into
a conversation with my friend the other
[SPEAKER_08]: day about mansplaining and she was going
off on how she's like oh like men just
[SPEAKER_08]: constantly mansplaining to women and I
said listen no offense but that's not a
[SPEAKER_08]: gender thing men mansplain to men as much
as they do it to women it's our disease
[SPEAKER_08]: but isn't there women's plating I don't
know I just think of it as like the the
[SPEAKER_08]: voice of reason I just think of it as the
voice of reason personally but nonetheless
[SPEAKER_00]: I really I really appreciate I really
appreciate all of the talk I've been sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of in the background getting some stuff
done and you know women explain it
[SPEAKER_00]: differently and I've been really
appreciating the conversation this morning
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's definitely got a tonality of
masculinity but I think that that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome and I appreciate that week after
week so thanks so much everybody you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: for you know talking about the plans with
such high regards and laughs hey I try to
[SPEAKER_09]: say you know there is a thing called male
intuition male intuition actually exists
[SPEAKER_09]: so you know you know be intuitive you know
hey Mark I was wondering have you ever
[SPEAKER_09]: done any extracting of endophytic fungi or
bacteria from from plants haven't but more
[SPEAKER_06]: people are asking me about that every day
you know we talked a little bit about this
[SPEAKER_06]: last week just because there's been more
you know municipalities that are now
[SPEAKER_06]: making you know fungi you know or
decriminalizing it or making it available
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually had a conversation with Alec
on whether or not the analytical labs that
[SPEAKER_06]: are in place now for the cannabis industry
are gonna start doing the analytical you
[SPEAKER_06]: know testing for some of these you know
fungal type products because as you know I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean having good analytical methods is
really important for accurate dosing
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if you're talking about you
know medicine for people who don't want
[SPEAKER_06]: the high of the psychedelic experience but
perhaps needed to control depression or
[SPEAKER_06]: other things I had an old friend reach out
to me who said you know cannabis just
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't doing it for my depression anymore
and I'm not well enough verse to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand where psychedelics can help but
I'm reading up on it a lot and just
[SPEAKER_06]: finding a lot of just great work going on
right now actually a lot of government
[SPEAKER_06]: funded work right now on both MDMA and and
psilocybin for to treat all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: condition that the paper I was just
reading yesterday Josh was really cool is
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about stage 4 cancer patients
getting MDMA and having basically a MDMA
[SPEAKER_06]: experience to kind of help their body
understand that what their medical
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions all about and and trying to get
their their mind to think about positive
[SPEAKER_06]: ways of healing themselves and it's just
so just powerful and just yeah a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: great work being done right now man so
cool crystal ball right the scientific
[SPEAKER_06]: literature it's out there for everybody to
look into yeah absolutely the more I go
[SPEAKER_00]: down the the long roads of the microbiome
the more that we're really realizing that
[SPEAKER_00]: health and well-being on emotional level
physical level spiritual level is so
[SPEAKER_00]: intricately connected to the microbiome
that you know I feel like we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: barely scratching the surface right now of
where we really need to get for humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as for the health and well-being
of the cannabis plants you know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: we're having a lot of these discussions
but in five years from now we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be talking about the endophytic you know
reactions that are going on within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and we're going to be counting
bacteria and different species and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the way that we're going to be
able to tell how healthy the plants are as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as how much medicine the plant is
providing for patients and also I mean and
[SPEAKER_09]: to say are you extracting endophytic fungi
and bacteria from plants isn't really a
[SPEAKER_09]: psychedelic question it's more there's
there's you know 30 to more there's
[SPEAKER_09]: different endophytic fungi that the plant
pulls out of the soil right it pulls
[SPEAKER_09]: bacteria and fungi out of the soil to
create its body as it's growing its own
[SPEAKER_09]: and those compounds are often medicinal
and just like I don't know if I froze I
[SPEAKER_09]: couldn't tell but uh just like we and we
may have discussed this on hashchurch
[SPEAKER_09]: before but like taxol right cures cancer
from the yew tree but and they and we said
[SPEAKER_09]: this before but they took all the bark off
the off the tree you know all through the
[SPEAKER_09]: 90s and left the tree out in the woods
because they were extracting taxol from
[SPEAKER_09]: the bark but after further studies and
further scientific studies they realized
[SPEAKER_09]: it was the endophytic fungi in the cambium
layer that was also producing taxol and in
[SPEAKER_09]: some cases producing it more than what was
in the bark so it was possible and this is
[SPEAKER_09]: you know more into the science realm you
know more than where i'm at you know where
[SPEAKER_09]: we're at more intuitive nature lovers but
in science you can extract these compounds
[SPEAKER_09]: and the plant is pulling up bacteria and
fungi into the plant and putting it back
[SPEAKER_09]: back into the soil it's it's replicating
those organisms in its body and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: putting it back into the soil and those
compounds are also capable of producing
[SPEAKER_09]: secondary metabolites you know outside of
uh i'm coming down with rona someone just
[SPEAKER_09]: wrote me no i'm all good bro but um but uh
anyway i know the cannabis plant has these
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds and i don't and i don't see that
we're studying them yet and it may be that
[SPEAKER_09]: you know there's a you know a thousand
acres of hemp you know holding endophytic
[SPEAKER_09]: fungi and bacteria that we don't know
about that we can extract and use for our
[SPEAKER_09]: health and well-being i feel like it's
it's a new frontier you know there's a few
[SPEAKER_09]: universities that are studying it you know
and then and then also you know there's
[SPEAKER_09]: psychedelic fungi in that whole entire
realm of breaking the chain and you know
[SPEAKER_09]: stopping you know not having the
boundaries and the chains that bind you
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's what i love so the nice thing
about these compounds is the nice thing
[SPEAKER_06]: about those compounds josh is that they're
water soluble so you know we're in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis everything is oil soluble not
very water soluble you can use pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: conventional methods to make a mushroom
tea for example blue juice right yeah the
[SPEAKER_08]: blue juice oh i've looked at my 300 liter
whistler reactor a few times and been like
[SPEAKER_08]: probably whip up a nice batch of blue
juice in that reactor yeah so mark is that
[SPEAKER_06]: like a a standardized product that you
think like one of these markets like in
[SPEAKER_06]: oregon that's legalized psychedelics could
actually you can go and buy your little
[SPEAKER_06]: shot of blue juice at the convenience
store someday or well i sure hope so i
[SPEAKER_08]: mean my goodness listen cannabis has been
amazing for the sort of i mean i don't
[SPEAKER_08]: want to say it hasn't been amazing for the
mental as well as the physical but sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: on this plane and now we're bringing in
the psychedelics which is going to help us
[SPEAKER_08]: in that sort of spiritual plane in that
sort of you know the mental health plane
[SPEAKER_08]: people are hurting and people end up
taking lithium and all sorts of drugs that
[SPEAKER_08]: fuck with your brain chemistry that are
created by companies and sold under the
[SPEAKER_08]: name pharmaceutical which if you drop the
p it's got the harm right there in the
[SPEAKER_08]: word harm like they're not even trying to
hide it i think of that as one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: biggest things coming in the queue right
now is when people who are seriously
[SPEAKER_08]: suffering from mental health and mental
illness can go and take these journeys
[SPEAKER_08]: with these plant medicines and you know
not have to not have to deal with it for
[SPEAKER_08]: the rest of their lives it should be an
you know it should be like a trip or two
[SPEAKER_08]: or three not like 25 years of taking
lithium you know this is these are
[SPEAKER_08]: accelerators that don't that don't take 25
years they happen immediately because once
[SPEAKER_08]: you have been and i take this from brian
and i can't even pronounce his last name
[SPEAKER_08]: the book that both alec and i spoke about
the immortality key he mentions a woman
[SPEAKER_08]: who was a full-blown atheist still an
atheist even after her trip but when asked
[SPEAKER_08]: about the mushroom and how she felt and
she was very she had deep deep depression
[SPEAKER_08]: she took mushrooms only once and and
totally sealed the deal on her depression
[SPEAKER_08]: when she was asked what would you say the
feeling was she said it felt like i was
[SPEAKER_08]: being in bathed in god's love and he said
i thought you were an atheist and she said
[SPEAKER_08]: well i am but that's the only thing i can
put into words that it felt like and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty potent i mean psychedelics
has has just catapulted us to the level
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're at right now you know i i
think that the entrance of mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed humanity to think outside of just
the agrarian sort of work that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing at the time and allowed them to
create spirituality and now here we are
[SPEAKER_00]: with psychedelics coming to heal
themselves more pharmaceuticals than ever
[SPEAKER_00]: before and i think that if we just
continue that action and percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: forward then we're really going to be
catapulted into the next level of humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next level of existence it's not
going to come from just our own collective
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness there has to be some kind of
a drop from outside of it so that our
[SPEAKER_00]: collective consciousness can you know
build off of something like that and i
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you know we owe so much to
plant medicines as to why we are the human
[SPEAKER_00]: beings that we are and the collective
consciousness that we are and on that note
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone grab your five grams of dried
mushrooms we're going to start the
[SPEAKER_09]: consumption part of the ritual and that's
what we mean by 5g yeah don't be against
[SPEAKER_08]: 5g 5g is powerful all these people that
are against 5g listen yes it will melt
[SPEAKER_08]: your brain but in a very good way and when
it precipitates back into a solid you'll
[SPEAKER_08]: be better for it so just don't be afraid
of 5g please i like the terrence mckenna
[SPEAKER_09]: 5g like you know drake thing that says no
to the 5g tower and yes to the 5g of
[SPEAKER_06]: mushrooms 5d it's the five has anyone seen
that jim carrey movie jim carrey plays
[SPEAKER_08]: terrence mckenna did it actually happen i
think i thought it was fake i looked into
[SPEAKER_08]: it there was no movie it was just someone
created like a like a an ad for it but i
[SPEAKER_08]: never actually saw any video of it yeah i
thought it was a movie that was released
[SPEAKER_06]: in like 2017 or something like that is
that not right i could never find it all i
[SPEAKER_08]: found was that it was like someone like a
fan-based thing they took a picture of jim
[SPEAKER_08]: with a beard and put it in and then
covered him in mushrooms and plants and
[SPEAKER_08]: made this super cool advert and it was uh
it was fake as bingo lombardi has just
[SPEAKER_08]: confirmed in chat we all know bingo's
never wrong about anything so i'll take
[SPEAKER_08]: that as the word of god bingo today you
were right and dr mark was wrong you can
[SPEAKER_06]: write that down bingo oh no no no i was
asking about i wanted to you know we're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for things like watch on netflix
and i i wanted to know if anyone had seen
[SPEAKER_08]: that or you know hoax hoax hoax you're
spreading false information mark fake news
[SPEAKER_08]: no i'm fake no wait not me not this week
deep fake technology wow well he spent
[SPEAKER_09]: some time with terrence mckenna on the big
island in kala kukua bay um you know on
[SPEAKER_09]: the big island was where terrence
mckenna's property is and that's where uh
[SPEAKER_09]: we we had dr alison on here before and she
works with uh leanne standish and you know
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're there's people in the in the
network that are taking care of the
[SPEAKER_09]: property and everything the ayahuasca
vines 50 years old and everything and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cactus too so they're taking care of
the cactus there yeah i was super blessed
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet terrence um i hung out with him
for a whole week and a half out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island um we kept meeting at 5 a.m to go
see the dolphins at kala kukua and i was
[SPEAKER_00]: just sitting with this guy and talking
with him and having the most incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations about dolphin magic and
consciousness and water and spores and
[SPEAKER_00]: just everything and it was like on third
day i started to like recognize his voice
[SPEAKER_00]: from late night a.m radio so it was art
bell it took me like then i was like wait
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute are you terrence mckenna and he
said yeah you know i am we never really
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced ourselves so i was really
thankful for those you know or mid 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: late 80s uh you know late night a.m so
that that's how i recognized that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: terrence and we became friends and what an
amazing guy just even spending that time
[SPEAKER_00]: with him uh you know talk about
catapulting i go back to that conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: those conversations that we had quite
often it's it's it's awesome you know he
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't uh just terrence mckenna because it
was a happen chance you know he was he he
[SPEAKER_00]: was born into that uh for an incredible
reason and to sit in front of that man and
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to him you know he he is unlike
a lot of other people so he affected me
[SPEAKER_08]: deeply he affected me very deeply i i got
turned on to him almost as a teenager you
[SPEAKER_08]: know by his from his tapes from the slm
institute and some of these other tapes
[SPEAKER_08]: and people in our community in winnipeg
manitoba they did not know who terrence
[SPEAKER_08]: mckenna was it was very random that we
somehow accidentally stumbled upon him
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely read the invisible landscape
that's an amazing book read true
[SPEAKER_08]: hallucinations the archaic revival food of
the gods you know every article he ever
[SPEAKER_08]: wrote in every magazine all of his
lectures including the ones with rupert
[SPEAKER_08]: sheldrake and ralph abraham i went deep on
terrence he was probably you know one of
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the people that affected me a great
great deal when i was younger and got you
[SPEAKER_08]: know we ordered our spores from him and
his wife cat uh from that that the big
[SPEAKER_08]: island that you're talking about that's
where those syzygy spores came from that
[SPEAKER_08]: him and his brother denis collected in the
amazon back in the late 70s before they
[SPEAKER_08]: wrote the book uh the mushroom growers
guide on how to grow psychedelic mushrooms
[SPEAKER_08]: indoors so and that book was the book we
used with the spores to actually grow
[SPEAKER_08]: these mushrooms and so for me i will
always have a huge place in my in my soul
[SPEAKER_08]: for the information that terrence mckenna
i agree yeah i totally agree i feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: he's given um you know so much to me and i
feel like more than anything he's given me
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible sense of humor on
psychedelics like i think of terrence
[SPEAKER_00]: mckenna when i'm on psychedelics and for
some reason just the hilarity comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: you know where you're just like wow this
world is fucking hilarious and i can't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe i was so serious about it last
week he like really has you know opened up
[SPEAKER_00]: the doors to let go of uh what we don't
laugh at ourselves about shit humans are
[SPEAKER_08]: hilarious yeah and terrence had that gift
he had he was sharp and had the gift of
[SPEAKER_08]: gab obviously and could just could just
say things that just you know would you
[SPEAKER_08]: would erupt into laughter and i was the
same way you know be tripping balls kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of like like almost like just
uncomfortably high and then think of
[SPEAKER_08]: terrence and think of all the words that
he prepared i'll tell you one thing that
[SPEAKER_08]: was the preparation for large-scale
mushroom tripping because that whole
[SPEAKER_08]: timothy leary thing with the book of the
dead and repeat and like recording his
[SPEAKER_08]: voice reading it to himself like if any of
you ever listened to tim you'd know that
[SPEAKER_08]: one of his worst trips ever was listening
to the book of dead while he was tripping
[SPEAKER_08]: balls in his voice his he had recorded it
himself because he couldn't read the book
[SPEAKER_08]: and he thought well i want to read the
book while i'm high so that was kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: the the the the way to lead yourself to a
bad trip whereas the terrence lectures and
[SPEAKER_08]: all of what he was sharing was just so
inspirational and so you know and and
[SPEAKER_08]: putting himself out there and shipping
those spores around the world at a time
[SPEAKER_08]: when holy christ like they could have
easily hammered down on him and put him in
[SPEAKER_08]: jail for 10 years but you know he kept he
still was doing it so no no doubt a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: props to terrence mckenna yeah and and i
need to give props for the bad trips too
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know absolutely bad trips have
given me the most important lessons of my
[SPEAKER_00]: entire life and i don't know if bad is
quite the word you know just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: intense trips he felt yeah the intense
trips the ones that just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: compartmentalize so easy human beings are
such incredible compartmentalizers that if
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't compute and it doesn't
compartmentalize then maybe if it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown then be afraid of it and i think
that you know that's that's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: uh hopefully we're going to be able to
break down with the new entrance of
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics you know that needs to
compartmentalize human beings resistance
[SPEAKER_08]: creates strength and you know if you don't
believe it just lift weights like if you
[SPEAKER_08]: lift weights that resistance will create
strength in your muscles and it's really
[SPEAKER_08]: no difference for the resistance of an
intense trip and whether or not you know
[SPEAKER_08]: it's almost like a psychic puzzle that
you're involved in and depending on you
[SPEAKER_08]: know it's a different filter of looking
through and so yeah huge huge props and
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know it's like the big the big
questions and the reason why we have
[SPEAKER_00]: science and the reason why we have all you
know the the buddhas say that the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: disease of humanity is the need to know
why and it's like i think that more than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything we're all just really wondering
where did we come from and where are we
[SPEAKER_00]: going i mean really and truly everything
else is noise and fluff and between
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that we're talking about is
trying to give us little tiny tidbits of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going to go now that we're
here and it's so beautiful that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine really helped us align with
either a giving us those answers or b
[SPEAKER_00]: helping us realize that those answers are
not important at all that we're all there
[SPEAKER_00]: and that just being here is good enough
yep and you know helps open us to those
[SPEAKER_09]: possibilities and big up alec alec i was
wanting to say and my name what's up ganja
[SPEAKER_12]: gil in the house today welcome guys hey i
just wanted to jump in real quick uh with
[SPEAKER_12]: on the Terrence McKenna conversation bless
his soul and he had Dennis McKenna too
[SPEAKER_12]: those dudes are legends but um yeah just
uh it's fascinating how Terrence McKenna
[SPEAKER_12]: had um you know selected identified a
chemo var of uh banisteriopsis capi um and
[SPEAKER_12]: brought it out to hawaii and they planned
to the ayahuasca vine out in hawaii and
[SPEAKER_12]: since then it's become essentially an
invasive weed like uh or an invasive plant
[SPEAKER_12]: in this way and so it's it's actually
terrible to see how he's growing in hawaii
[SPEAKER_12]: and uh you know and the the vine itself
it's a it's a woody leona which is like or
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a leona which is a woody vine and uh
and and it grows and stretches uh to kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of to to catch the sun and over its life
i've heard some really cool stories about
[SPEAKER_12]: the plant um over it's you know in the
jungle in in brazil and the amazon and
[SPEAKER_12]: Peru the vine will kind of branch up to
kind of catch the sun it'll it'll um kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of it'll pull you know as it grows it'll
actually pull trees down out of the ground
[SPEAKER_12]: to open up the canopy of the forest so
that it can kind of open up light and then
[SPEAKER_12]: it brings in all kinds of other life and
you know the below canopy um but but the
[SPEAKER_12]: vine is is it's it's fascinating how much
it's kind of uh kind of spreading on the
[SPEAKER_12]: island of hawaii um you know and just
similar like eucalyptus for better or for
[SPEAKER_12]: worse but as far as it goes on the global
kind of conservation effort to you know
[SPEAKER_12]: plant more of the vine as consumption and
um and popularity of ayahuasca kind of you
[SPEAKER_12]: know continues to to grow uh you know just
the whole concept of brand cultivate or
[SPEAKER_12]: conservation you know transfer camera kind
of really has made a major effect in that
[SPEAKER_12]: you know post uh you know posting from us
absolutely well said alec thanks for
[SPEAKER_08]: sharing uh mark rose my manufacturer who
uh from in napalm says he grew the spores
[SPEAKER_08]: in catmandu back in 1998 and then they
went wild in the rose garden in the front
[SPEAKER_08]: yard so he just shared that i just wanted
to say one more thing before we give gil
[SPEAKER_08]: the floor and let him uh come in and say
hello which was that imagine if life
[SPEAKER_08]: itself is a disassociative we're not
supposed to know where we came from and
[SPEAKER_08]: we're not supposed to know where we're
going we can get little glimpses and
[SPEAKER_08]: little flashes and this is the whole
experience this is why this is so fun and
[SPEAKER_08]: so terrifying simultaneously here on
planet earth but i'm certain that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: not supposed to know where we came from
and we're not supposed to know where we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going because if we did it would affect
the experience and the experience is why
[SPEAKER_08]: we're all here so yeah welcome ganja gil
good morning everyone thank you very much
[SPEAKER_13]: for uh having me on as always uh it's a
pleasure to be here with you guys it's
[SPEAKER_13]: nice to hear your voice i'm not sure i
have too much to contribute to the
[SPEAKER_13]: conversation at this current moment but
again i'm just stoked to be here with you
[SPEAKER_13]: all on this morning it's been warmer in
california than it should be recently it's
[SPEAKER_13]: been real warm still kind of waiting for
winter to come hopefully it comes but uh
[SPEAKER_13]: feeling good dude it's another beautiful
day i'm just like to actually sit here and
[SPEAKER_13]: relax this sunday morning with you guys
and smoke some hash and listen to the
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation well if that's not what it's
all about right there in a nutshell i mean
[SPEAKER_08]: that if we had a mission statement here at
hash church gil just spit it out so there
[SPEAKER_08]: it is welcome welcome man oh we got the
chat going on go go ahead john what are
[SPEAKER_09]: some of the strains you've been watching
in the last week gil i kind of took a
[SPEAKER_13]: different approach this year actually and
like i grew a lot from seed um being in
[SPEAKER_13]: california i have access to a lot of
desirable clone-only genetics and uh this
[SPEAKER_13]: past year i grew pretty much strictly seed
i kind of like go back and forth it's
[SPEAKER_13]: funny you know like one year i go like
grow all clones and then i'm like oh that
[SPEAKER_13]: was boring now i want to do seeds and then
i'll do seeds and then crack like way more
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds than i need and like end up getting
way more males than i thought i would or
[SPEAKER_13]: you know uh the roly-poly's will eat all
my seedlings or you know it ends up being
[SPEAKER_13]: always a lot of work so sometimes after a
season i get a little lit like oh man i'm
[SPEAKER_13]: gonna put the training wheels back on and
just get some clones and keep it easy you
[SPEAKER_13]: know but uh the seed thing really worked
out really well for me this year um i kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of it's all mixed seno washes because you
know i don't have a very large garden and
[SPEAKER_13]: i chose to grow about 35 different
varieties not senos but varieties so in a
[SPEAKER_13]: small garden you can imagine it's all
small batch um but that's kind of what i
[SPEAKER_13]: wanted to do this year last year i only
did like a handful of like big dumper hash
[SPEAKER_13]: strains and it was cool but it kind of
like lost its interest after a little
[SPEAKER_13]: while you know after you wash so many
barrels of the same strain it's kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: like oh i know what it's gonna do you know
like if you press the same strain over and
[SPEAKER_13]: over again you know what it's gonna do so
this past year like i said i grew like 30
[SPEAKER_13]: different varieties and it's been super
fun just to do these little batches and
[SPEAKER_13]: see what they do and uh at first i was
kind of like had mixed feelings about the
[SPEAKER_13]: mixed seno washes you know like oh is it
kind of generic you know you should really
[SPEAKER_13]: be selecting the one and whatnot but i
started to kind of think about it more and
[SPEAKER_13]: i feel like you know when you look at like
you know let's be real i practice mostly
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 packs of seeds you know just small 12
packs whatever you know in a 10 pack
[SPEAKER_13]: you'll probably feel like you know half of
them will lean towards the mom half of
[SPEAKER_13]: them will lead towards you know the dad
and you know if you come in between and i
[SPEAKER_13]: started to think about it and i'm like oh
that's kind of a good representation of
[SPEAKER_13]: the actual the cultivar because it's like
got a little bit of this got a little bit
[SPEAKER_13]: of that it's pulling from all of it you
know so maybe it's not so much generic as
[SPEAKER_13]: much as it's like a pretty good
representation of it and uh it's been
[SPEAKER_13]: working really well yield wise um it's
definitely interesting to watch the
[SPEAKER_13]: different quality of resins interact with
one another in the same bag you know you
[SPEAKER_13]: can definitely see certain resins kind of
starting to dissolve the other one but uh
[SPEAKER_13]: it's worked out really good and uh it's
been really fun and uh i've been doing a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of papaya crosses papaya is really
popular in california this year so uh did
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of papaya stuff um that kidmasana
down in compton he just dusts everything
[SPEAKER_13]: with the same mail that wilson mail he has
wilson is um papaya times banana og
[SPEAKER_13]: crossed with tropic and a cookie f2 and uh
just a real solid mail that he hits
[SPEAKER_13]: everything with and i definitely cracked a
bunch of seeds from him and they all did
[SPEAKER_13]: really well man they all were tropical
island cocktail fruit pineapple banana
[SPEAKER_13]: turps you know which i like funk myself
i'm really into the gas stuff but it seems
[SPEAKER_13]: like my area california really likes that
fruity turp stuff and i don't know you
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of keep the people happy and whatnot
but uh yeah just uh this week i watched
[SPEAKER_13]: some chem d cross with day glow from
someone out of uh colorado was really
[SPEAKER_13]: really good did really great then i did
the chem d to purple og that one came out
[SPEAKER_13]: purple it was really cool to see the
purple resin but like didn't really yield
[SPEAKER_13]: well um uh but what else do i got in the
freeze dryer right now i got wilson zero
[SPEAKER_13]: in there right now which is original
wilson from onion noodles um which is just
[SPEAKER_13]: his original wilson the banana og papaya
uh chapa cana that's in the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_06]: right now looking really good is this a
fish head that's naming these strains
[SPEAKER_13]: wilson so that's so funny that you say
that because um if not the believe it or
[SPEAKER_13]: not i always thought the same thing and i
told them that i'm like you guys know
[SPEAKER_13]: about the wilson tune and like most of
them don't um what it is is it's again
[SPEAKER_13]: banana og papaya chapa cana cookie so it
smells like a tropical island so i guess
[SPEAKER_13]: from that movie cast away i never saw it
myself but it's got uh what's his name uh
[SPEAKER_13]: tom hanks in it wilson ball yeah so that's
yeah that's where the wilson comes from
[SPEAKER_13]: supposedly i guess um yeah island chirps
is that wilson with 19 l's i don't know
[SPEAKER_13]: about that marcus as far as i know like i
said it's the one from onion noodles oh i
[SPEAKER_13]: was just being silly like i said from what
oh okay i'm sorry dude if you ever heard
[SPEAKER_08]: fish sing the song willson there's about
19 l's in there for sure well there you go
[SPEAKER_13]: now and now i understand sorry yeah they
don't i want that way though i wanted to
[SPEAKER_08]: mention in regards to you talking about
mixed cultivars and kind of the difference
[SPEAKER_08]: and i'm sure sam will probably want to tap
in here at one point because back in the
[SPEAKER_08]: day and i don't know if this was pre-71 or
what when sam but was there not like a
[SPEAKER_08]: time where in afghanistan they were
growing type one and type two plants you
[SPEAKER_08]: know having that sort of selection just it
was reminiscent when he started talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about like mixing all the phenols from a
sea batch and and how i can kind of see us
[SPEAKER_08]: getting there as we go into this isolating
cultivars isolating resin gland heads to
[SPEAKER_08]: the point where we may do a full circle
and now it's like you know what i want to
[SPEAKER_08]: run this whole field into hash and i want
to create a profile you know probably one
[SPEAKER_08]: that's never going to be recreated but
something that would still have its place
[SPEAKER_08]: and be considered special by any accounts
uh i i would love to see that happen and
[SPEAKER_08]: as you were talking about throwing in
multiple you know all the different
[SPEAKER_08]: phenols to really get an idea yeah full
field full field fresh frozen full field
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah be nice shifting i'm gonna shift our
grow outside next year into uh more strain
[SPEAKER_11]: selection phenol well just you know many
phenols same thing we're talking about if
[SPEAKER_11]: it's interesting to hear gil talking about
it i could see getting bored with it also
[SPEAKER_11]: perhaps but i am interested to see whole
bed sets just go to one strain type from
[SPEAKER_11]: my breeding with my sharp for sure and
then some headband show key that i just
[SPEAKER_11]: read to or just dropping amazing amounts
of hash and really good quality and i just
[SPEAKER_11]: want to lock in more on the the you know
terpian profile to match up to it you know
[SPEAKER_09]: up to the dump so yeah i like that you're
rocking the headband still i mean that's
[SPEAKER_09]: such a beautiful strain you know over the
years and there yeah it's holy grails like
[SPEAKER_11]: a breeding cornerstone for even things
like my gas mask completely lends to that
[SPEAKER_11]: you know the mac and the kosher don't hurt
but it definitely goes back to the
[SPEAKER_11]: headband grease that we pull and then to
go back to the bubble bags you know that's
[SPEAKER_11]: like just pulling this greasy greasy dank
resin we just want a couple whole plant
[SPEAKER_11]: from the greenhouse for um cured resin dry
flower wash from sun ground and then the
[SPEAKER_11]: it's air dried but the nugget like the 90
to 120 coming off is so goopy that it has
[SPEAKER_11]: more oxidization on the crust uh you know
outside of the bubble you know nuggets you
[SPEAKER_11]: can barely do anything if you look at them
they melt and it was both the diesel band
[SPEAKER_11]: the headband just dropped it like that the
d band came out a lot lighter less
[SPEAKER_11]: oxidization seemed like a little bit more
quality grow but yeah amazing for a fuel
[SPEAKER_11]: type in maine actually into the greenhouse
and it wasn't the prettiest on the finish
[SPEAKER_11]: but even just tended well by hand hand cut
dry barn storage for two to three months
[SPEAKER_11]: you know controlled temp humidity in the
bin really clean take down but we do large
[SPEAKER_11]: whole plant sections we don't take any
leaf much leaf off after defoliation from
[SPEAKER_11]: you know into flower where we're open up
sites getting air we don't take anything
[SPEAKER_11]: off really thereafter until you know it's
time to trim it by hand dry so great
[SPEAKER_11]: results whole plant flower you know dry
cured resin bubble lately like crazy i
[SPEAKER_08]: feel if i had i feel like if i had less of
integrity than i do i'd have these really
[SPEAKER_08]: cheesy kind of like this conversation is
brought to you by bubble bags you know and
[SPEAKER_08]: have this whole sort of cheesy
advertisement in the middle but the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: time you were talking i just felt like man
you are definitely a professional grower
[SPEAKER_08]: and hash maker like even just the way you
explain your process it's just like damn
[SPEAKER_06]: this guy's like a lifer he's in this
you're adding an extra syllable in there
[SPEAKER_06]: so just say oxidation everybody say
oxidation oxidation thanks dr mark you're
[SPEAKER_14]: keeping us learning uh brian those photos
look really incredible man uh tiger
[SPEAKER_14]: stripes gas mask uh is that what you're
you're working with right now yeah get up
[SPEAKER_11]: there and check that out yeah i'd love to
share i gotta you know i'd love to share
[SPEAKER_11]: out some genetics to you i've been meaning
to as well yeah i did like some really
[SPEAKER_11]: nice work from the gas mask out i'm i'm
super impressed with that chart um kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: like a comic name on it but it's what it
is is it hits that it's a lime kush gmo
[SPEAKER_11]: triangle kush skunk on on the other end
for the show key so we've seen that do
[SPEAKER_11]: amazing things for hash already on its own
and it was a nice dude that went in on a
[SPEAKER_11]: selected dude from the crew for that's a
swamp boy seeds genetic and yeah we got
[SPEAKER_11]: like this lime to apricot term on the gas
this time with that one phenotype it's
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely gmo skunk heavy you know shout
out the skunk skunk man it's got skunk all
[SPEAKER_11]: over it's kind of like a baby pukey sweet
really really raunchy sharp cheddar type
[SPEAKER_11]: thing and uh we'll see how it washes
haven't washed quite yet what's the water
[SPEAKER_06]: on the on these things like and you have
again same question to you that i asked
[SPEAKER_06]: markus earlier what do you do with the
water is there anything you can do with it
[SPEAKER_11]: or you just discard it or we're discarding
it we're smaller baths when we do like
[SPEAKER_11]: gail when we wash we're not a big setup
we're so low tech honestly it's it's kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of funny even but we're you know we're
learning to bump up our volume our water
[SPEAKER_11]: goes to waste at this point we compost
everything else we just really really love
[SPEAKER_11]: our compost so i know i could tell you on
the farm we give ways to that but um yeah
[SPEAKER_11]: haven't i haven't dabbled into the water
we've talked about the water like how to
[SPEAKER_11]: isolate it chill it almost how to serve it
if somebody were interested in wanting to
[SPEAKER_11]: actually drink some of these things the
fruity ones smell kind of good at some
[SPEAKER_06]: certain scale and again markus i don't
know if you could comment to this but can
[SPEAKER_06]: you you could almost steam distill that
that terpene i know where you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: what listen listen this this takes us back
okay this takes us back to about maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: 2014 how old is hash church are we like
six years old right what the hell okay so
[SPEAKER_08]: get this k from tricom technologies hits
me up one day and he's like working with
[SPEAKER_08]: sasha shulgin doing terps and stuff and he
says listen i'm gonna give you a goal no
[SPEAKER_08]: no he doesn't talk to me dude at all he
won't even reply to me when i hit him up
[SPEAKER_08]: and say please let's be friends like i'm
sorry like he when i partnered up with
[SPEAKER_08]: tony that was like the ultimate slap in
his face selling the terps but listen it
[SPEAKER_08]: gets better this is how it starts this is
why
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah yeah absolutely i also don't speak
with todd anymore so neither neither
[SPEAKER_08]: neither there what i wanted to say was
this so he calls me up he tells me listen
[SPEAKER_08]: i'm gonna give you a gold nugget you need
to figure out a way to get the terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the bubble water and like put back
into the hash that's it you figure that
[SPEAKER_08]: out you're laughing and i was kind of like
okay yeah that sounds you know it's not
[SPEAKER_08]: like i haven't thought of that you know
but and realized that i don't have the
[SPEAKER_08]: tools to get such a thing done so i phone
two people and i tell tony and i tell her
[SPEAKER_08]: ratio and i say hey listen like you guys
need to figure out how to get the bubble
[SPEAKER_08]: water the terpenes out of the bubble water
you guys got access to labs and you can do
[SPEAKER_08]: this get her done well this is only my
guess but my guess is that tony at the
[SPEAKER_08]: time was at a pretty big lab visiting in
uh florida and i suspect he was standing
[SPEAKER_08]: next to a chemist that worked in that lab
and said hey how do how could i get
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes off of plants and the guy was
probably like you can steam distill them
[SPEAKER_08]: or hydrovac diffuse them as long as you
use a chiller to precipitate your uh your
[SPEAKER_08]: um your vapor it'll precipitate clear
instead of yellow because it's generally
[SPEAKER_08]: in that process that it goes yellow which
i didn't know uh but i talked to a chemist
[SPEAKER_08]: myself and that's what they said and i see
mark waving his head up and down not
[SPEAKER_08]: interrupting me so he it must be correct
so anyway tony had like okay yeah tony had
[SPEAKER_08]: turps like a week later but from he didn't
even bother with the water maybe it was
[SPEAKER_08]: even two weeks later but it was like we'd
have to go back and we could look at hash
[SPEAKER_08]: church because that's how we'll be able to
figure it out but it was quick and then i
[SPEAKER_08]: called her ratio one more time and kind of
busted his balls and i was like hey you
[SPEAKER_08]: know tony's got the turps what's going on
her ratio and he had them like i don't
[SPEAKER_08]: know two or three days later and that
started a whole thing which actually
[SPEAKER_08]: helped both of those guys and i think it
helped the cannabis world and all of us to
[SPEAKER_08]: have access to those terpenes and this
dipping and it was it started blue river
[SPEAKER_08]: absolutely 100 of course that was the
start of blue river so it was a really
[SPEAKER_08]: neat thing that all started here through
through hash church and with k and so you
[SPEAKER_08]: know at that point k was feeling that he i
don't know he said he had a patent or
[SPEAKER_08]: something on all the ways you could make
terpenes with cannabis and and it just was
[SPEAKER_08]: it just all went bad i felt really
terrible about it because now i don't
[SPEAKER_08]: really speak to any of those guys and i
kind of had you know i had love for all of
[SPEAKER_08]: them i enjoyed talking with todd i enjoyed
talking with tony i enjoyed uh talking
[SPEAKER_08]: with all of those guys and so k especially
k i'd known for almost 20 years we wrote
[SPEAKER_08]: for red eye magazine together back in the
day when nick was still alive and doing
[SPEAKER_08]: that so sometimes life plays out the way
it does you know you can only help to uh
[SPEAKER_08]: figure it out and heal so i'm sure
there'll be a time in life where we can
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully come to that point where it's
just like because i know i play a part in
[SPEAKER_08]: it i don't pretend to think that i don't
go ahead colin you guys will come back
[SPEAKER_14]: together man you will you guys were too
close then yeah i was there for it he
[SPEAKER_06]: thought that somehow in in indra had
gotten together with um there's a group
[SPEAKER_06]: out in california that was selling uh cold
trap that people were hooking up to their
[SPEAKER_06]: vacuum ovens because for a long time
people didn't realize that these terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: are fleeting fleeting meaning that you
pull them with your vacuum they're gone
[SPEAKER_06]: they're out the exhaust and so if you cold
trap that and i don't know if you remember
[SPEAKER_06]: this episode mark there was an episode of
hash church where tony was sitting in the
[SPEAKER_06]: lab for that episode and he had the cold
finger in the back but he was like really
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of like hush hush about showing
exactly how he got this and we see he had
[SPEAKER_06]: a couple vials in front of him that he was
dabbing but he didn't want to show his
[SPEAKER_06]: tech when you know we it was funny because
you're you're absolutely right the way you
[SPEAKER_06]: recall this timeline was absolutely
correct because i had had several multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: hour long discussion where i didn't
include canada but he can call me and talk
[SPEAKER_06]: for unlimited time so he would call me and
we talked six to eight hours at a time and
[SPEAKER_06]: i described you know basically vacuum
distillation and cold traps and all that
[SPEAKER_06]: and he figured it out and and um we i
shared a lot of this with tony because
[SPEAKER_06]: actually my coming on to hash church was
at her ratio's insistence because tony was
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to talk shit on this whole terpene
isolation thing and and her ratio was
[SPEAKER_05]: sending me facebook messages saying mark
you gotta come on tony's talking shit on
[SPEAKER_05]: half the church again you gotta come on
center street he never said that to me he
[SPEAKER_08]: just said oh i want to invite this this
chemist dr mark on and i said all right
[SPEAKER_06]: man it's yeah that's that's how i came on
so how interesting that all these episodes
[SPEAKER_06]: later here we are talking about it again
but you know still even at you know best
[SPEAKER_06]: friends farm level i mean i always feel
like you know whenever you i've only done
[SPEAKER_06]: small scale water patch production and i
always feel like man i i want to do
[SPEAKER_06]: something with what i can't just like what
do i throw this away no there's shit in
[SPEAKER_06]: there there's stuff in there that i want
what are the right methods to isolate it
[SPEAKER_06]: and and use it okay what's this we're
looking at i don't really have a comment
[SPEAKER_13]: as far as isolating the terpenes out but
from a living soil situation where
[SPEAKER_13]: perspective i had the pleasure of working
with steve campwell in nevada out of green
[SPEAKER_13]: life productions in the beginning of
december and he was so excited to just put
[SPEAKER_13]: it back into his soil that's what he
wanted to do with the water and it totally
[SPEAKER_13]: makes sense to organic we loaded it right
and you know yeah you know what i'm saying
[SPEAKER_06]: the plants the plants respond to it and
dragon fly earth medicine i mean terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: is just low lying fruit bacterias all over
that shit and ours and that stuff is gone
[SPEAKER_06]: metabolized mineralized call what you will
it ain't terpenes anymore as soon as you
[SPEAKER_14]: add soil some of the some of the
cannabinoids are hydrophobic so i would
[SPEAKER_14]: imagine mark that you know i i've done
some experience where you you just you
[SPEAKER_14]: distill some things you distill it down
and try to collect that and then you can
[SPEAKER_14]: use a little bit of that material um to go
back into have no problem breaking down
[SPEAKER_06]: hydrophobic shit hydrophobic hydrophilic
they can break down everything except
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon bonded fluorine they can't figure
that out just yet you know they'll figure
[SPEAKER_06]: it out after a few hundred million years
so i think tinctures and other
[SPEAKER_14]: formulations that require the water since
in my setting i use all ro everything's
[SPEAKER_14]: clean so it's clean and clean out um so
you could you could use it in those
[SPEAKER_14]: specific use cases such as different skews
that have drinks or teas or i'd imagine a
[SPEAKER_14]: tea you know that would be something that
you can definitely look into um there's
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a lot and then obviously feeding
it back into your system if you um if it
[SPEAKER_14]: checks all the boxes and you can do that
in your respective environment but that's
[SPEAKER_14]: what i've seen but uh yeah i think um if
we had someone develop a system to kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: catch some of this stuff i think it could
be helpful i would imagine i would have a
[SPEAKER_06]: limited shelf life like you couldn't just
formulate it into say like a drink and
[SPEAKER_06]: again just to go back to the gmp
discussion you know trying to standardize
[SPEAKER_06]: production on basically a waste product
something that's going to vary from batch
[SPEAKER_06]: to batch have inconsistent level of
terpenes because some things are more
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene rich than others so not only with
the terpene profile what's in the water is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to change but the amount's going to
change and for most farms it may not be
[SPEAKER_06]: worth it again just to return it back to
the soil is just a great utilization for
[SPEAKER_06]: it i just imagine that again if you try to
store it without preserving it it's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to foul pretty quickly so that goes back
it's a cold cane you have to be cozies
[SPEAKER_06]: around the cans that get soaked with this
material are probably going to end up
[SPEAKER_06]: smelling pretty foul unless you clean them
out on a pretty regular basis so again
[SPEAKER_06]: that would be something that gmp would
want a regular record of how often does
[SPEAKER_06]: that cozy get taken off that can how often
is it cleaned what's the procedure how do
[SPEAKER_06]: you know that it's cleaned and you know so
gmp just affects your production on a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole different scale that you know you
don't necessarily think about when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: just doing small scale artisan type
production absolutely yeah i think the the
[SPEAKER_14]: product would have to be cold chained
through and through to your point
[SPEAKER_14]: otherwise yeah it's going to ferment
there's going to be well not only that but
[SPEAKER_08]: it damn straight better be like fully
organic and regenerative and sustainable
[SPEAKER_08]: and not like poisoned out at any point in
time because that's uh i wouldn't want to
[SPEAKER_08]: be pouring that into my plants i wouldn't
want to be drinking that i wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_09]: to you know i mean definitely it's
drinkable like right out of the thing you
[SPEAKER_09]: can just drink the water i mean and and in
a regenerative sense right like we've
[SPEAKER_09]: that's the whole thing you're just like oh
my god i just made tea thank you i'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to drink this you know but you can
carbonated it before too and made like
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful carbonated hashed water out of
it and served it up and gorgeous little
[SPEAKER_06]: champagne flu it was awesome have you fed
it to animals i'm wondering if you for
[SPEAKER_06]: water i think you broke up on us there did
did you say you fed the animals i know we
[SPEAKER_13]: put it under the microscope in vegas me
and steve and a deaf hello no we've been
[SPEAKER_09]: hey is he still with us go ahead go ahead
okay if you can go again if you had fed it
[SPEAKER_13]: to animals yes okay yeah never mind go
ahead gil oh no sorry sorry i'm still new
[SPEAKER_13]: to this guys i'm not i'm not used to all
the group conversation on mine i apologize
[SPEAKER_13]: to the listeners but uh yeah no steve was
really excited like i said give it back to
[SPEAKER_13]: the plants and i'll say one time we were
kind of like lazy about it i'm not trying
[SPEAKER_13]: to like uh we left it in the machine
overnight you know like and then cleaned
[SPEAKER_13]: it out the next day and i'll say the water
was drastically different than when the
[SPEAKER_13]: next time we evacuated it right away out
of the large vessel into a tea brewer you
[SPEAKER_13]: know it was still very very very cold
obviously you know we were using it for
[SPEAKER_13]: ice extraction um and overnight we brewed
it we aerated it and when we came in there
[SPEAKER_13]: was stuff going on in there it was it was
fairly barren but like you'd find these
[SPEAKER_13]: little pockets of these like you know
little communities starting to develop and
[SPEAKER_13]: we definitely saw you know bacillus rod
shaped bacillus some oculus again not
[SPEAKER_13]: definitely i'll never say definitely
because like i'm not really great at
[SPEAKER_13]: identifying stuff you know like you got to
really stare there and watch it move
[SPEAKER_13]: around for a while but you saw some things
you know what i mean and uh to me it was
[SPEAKER_13]: promising and it was cool um obviously you
can't really see um terpenes under the
[SPEAKER_13]: microscope per se you know you're just
seeing the biology but uh the plants
[SPEAKER_13]: respond to it um instantly like when uh he
foliar sprayed it um you see the plants
[SPEAKER_13]: love it he watered it in um i thought it
was cool he was really into it to me it's
[SPEAKER_13]: just a way to keep you know the loop
closed do something with the water rather
[SPEAKER_13]: than nothing but uh again i'm sure mark
can tell us some more stuff or tell me
[SPEAKER_09]: what i just said was possibly wrong well i
i would i would just add that you know
[SPEAKER_09]: like depending on the volume of hash that
you're washing and the size of bed or the
[SPEAKER_09]: size of soil that you're working with
there is a level of residue that comes
[SPEAKER_09]: with having you know this water you know
so we found like if either you know if you
[SPEAKER_09]: were say doing it every single day and
every watering you were using was hash
[SPEAKER_09]: water you would start to see a little
residue develop on the top of the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: we really find that that's the overdone
part of it we find that you know for like
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor sun-grown gardens and what we're
doing is if we're washing our own hash
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're we're putting the right amount
of hash water back into the soil if we
[SPEAKER_00]: were to be taking other people's hash or
other people's material and turning into
[SPEAKER_00]: hash water maybe it would be too much but
it seems like in a garden closed loop
[SPEAKER_00]: situation if you're washing your own
plants then absolutely you got to put all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that water back into the soil we've
been like drawing a thousand foot two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand foot hoses forever from our
washing stations just to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: every single greenhouse is hit we do it
all year long even now will be uh gravity
[SPEAKER_09]: feed hoses will just go from our you know
hash station down to the next greenhouse
[SPEAKER_09]: and whatnot and we're just locking in you
know that water but I do I do agree this
[SPEAKER_09]: that that water definitely needs to be
used fresh it's like it's like cold press
[SPEAKER_09]: juice you know it's not something that you
you let sit around because it is it's
[SPEAKER_09]: living especially if you're using fresh
frozen if you're using fresh frozen then
[SPEAKER_09]: you're getting a lot of that bacteria and
fungi and things that are in the plant you
[SPEAKER_09]: know in the water and and then when you
use it I think that would be really smart
[SPEAKER_09]: to to maybe use kefir crystals and do some
kind of a kefir water fermentation with
[SPEAKER_09]: that another thing I would say is that we
tried to use the leaf afterwards because
[SPEAKER_09]: it's really easy to put the leaf back into
a compost system or some kind of you know
[SPEAKER_09]: top dress and that's a beautiful thing but
then I was like oh we should try and make
[SPEAKER_09]: bokashi from it you know so let's try and
ferment it with lactic acid bacteria so
[SPEAKER_09]: that we can lock in this green living
nutrient you know with this lactic acid
[SPEAKER_09]: but then we found it got really uh sour
fast and there was a lot of water in it so
[SPEAKER_09]: then we said oh let's take the leaf and
let's put it in an apple press and press
[SPEAKER_09]: all the water out of it to try and get it
as dry as possible so we were making these
[SPEAKER_09]: like leaf pucks in the in the apple press
and then pulling them out and then
[SPEAKER_09]: aerating in it and it was like oh it was
really nice but then we found we still
[SPEAKER_09]: needed to use like half organic bran or
some kind of sawdust in with the green
[SPEAKER_09]: leaf in order to get to fermentation
because once you started putting that leaf
[SPEAKER_09]: back into a closed system some type of bag
or some kind of thing and try and ferment
[SPEAKER_09]: it for future fermentations it would just
sour off because too much water it would
[SPEAKER_09]: it would have an the anaerobic anaerobes
would come and overtake so you needed that
[SPEAKER_09]: that dryness and then a little bit of like
either sawdust or some type of bran some
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of brown material and then saturate
that with some kind of lactic acid
[SPEAKER_09]: bacteria or em or some kind of fermenting
and that was the way we had success from
[SPEAKER_09]: turning the leaf into a bokashi and
bokashi is just any bran or any leaf
[SPEAKER_09]: fermented that's just a blanket term for
you know locking lactic acid bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and earlier you guys were saying
you know how is it that we can really save
[SPEAKER_00]: these terpenes well we feel like as
cultivators the way that we can save the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes is just give it back to the soil
because we've definitely noticed you know
[SPEAKER_00]: since we've been doing that for the last
15 I don't even know we've always given
[SPEAKER_00]: back the water it just always made sense
to us our terpene profiles and our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and everything is just really
well especially in a hugo culture carbon
[SPEAKER_09]: rich carbon sequestration bed system
you're just like saturating with this
[SPEAKER_09]: green turp water and this green turp water
just wraps around all these rocks and
[SPEAKER_09]: sticks and stuff you're just like oh hell
yeah that's my system you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_09]: and it just turns into future crystals I
mean hopefully we have crystals in the
[SPEAKER_09]: soil to charge up the crystals in the
plant because they're all crystals and so
[SPEAKER_09]: that's the thing now we're going to start
seeds really soon we should really think
[SPEAKER_09]: about starting seeds on crystals and
feeding it with your hash water right from
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning and so right from the
germination a little bit of hash water
[SPEAKER_00]: because then you get to teach the plant
where it's going to go later in life why
[SPEAKER_06]: not well you're teaching the bacteria
that's in between these chemicals and the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant where it's going right right so yeah
it's like the people who germinate their
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds by you know putting them in their
mouths first and letting the amylase
[SPEAKER_06]: enzymes and their saliva kind of like be
the first you know moisture that actually
[SPEAKER_06]: gets inside the seed when it germinates
people think that again that's a way of
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of like personally putting your you
know sort of thing on the plant but you
[SPEAKER_06]: know the thing I always like about like
what you guys say is that everything you
[SPEAKER_06]: say is that what you're you're sort of
feeding this this chemical biome or this
[SPEAKER_06]: chemo or whatever it is I mean it's like
there's these chemicals and these
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients that are being supplied by the
fungi and by the bacteria and fungi again
[SPEAKER_06]: just plays such a huge enormous role in
everything that we do in this living world
[SPEAKER_06]: fungi are just everywhere everywhere right
and the bacteria are just everywhere so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like they play such a vital important
role in life itself and if we think again
[SPEAKER_06]: that we could somehow you know use any
microbial agents or disinfect ourselves to
[SPEAKER_06]: be completely clean we're we're we're
dreaming and that's just again a misnomer
[SPEAKER_06]: of you know people who want to you know
take an antibiotic as soon as they get a
[SPEAKER_06]: sore throat because they think that
whatever they have it's something that's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be cured by some pill and it's an
antibiotic so I can take it that's no good
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway I think if we're using the hashed
water and the turp turp water because we
[SPEAKER_09]: do it for the turps like Steve Cantwell I
think that we're maybe feeding the ganja
[SPEAKER_09]: turpinome I mean it's a biome you know but
it's a ganja turpinome because we're just
[SPEAKER_09]: recycling turps but it's more than that of
course different than a misnomer a
[SPEAKER_09]: turpinome maybe maybe it's a turp gnome
potentially you know on a side note on a
[SPEAKER_08]: side note I did watch Chile's son again
the other day go through his turpinese
[SPEAKER_08]: language I just like randomly cracked it
open and showed a bunch of people in my
[SPEAKER_08]: lab and they were just like whoa that is
ridiculous who is that guy classic moment
[SPEAKER_08]: in time classic moment in time classic
shout out to the turp gnome is that you
[SPEAKER_12]: know Chile Chile are you talking about
young turp young turp I am yeah yeah no
[SPEAKER_12]: that's awesome you know it's really funny
about that yeah I just cracked up so much
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of uh you know whenever that is just
going off um but you know over um over the
[SPEAKER_12]: last many years we've been uh kind of
aggregating all our turp data and we we've
[SPEAKER_12]: created uh what I've been joking we're
referring to as uh Rosetta Stone to learn
[SPEAKER_12]: how to speak and teach turpinese um you
know which is a like a classification
[SPEAKER_12]: system that essentially sorts turpin by
primary mono and sasquiao turpin content
[SPEAKER_12]: you know into the groups that we see out
there it's actually how the emerald cup is
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be um judging flower this year so
all flower entries that are entered in the
[SPEAKER_12]: emerald cup are going to be um chemo type
right tested for cannabis and turps and
[SPEAKER_12]: pre-sorted um into their primary turpin
groups like all you're seeing together
[SPEAKER_12]: mirror seeing all limiting to get the
limiting and all turpinoline or
[SPEAKER_12]: turpinoline and then judges are going to
get uh entries anonymized that they're
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be judging within each class and
kind of choosing best in class um so it
[SPEAKER_12]: would be top one two and three of each
turpin group and then those advanced to
[SPEAKER_12]: the top uh 20 that essentially would be uh
judged heads up wow how cool is that
[SPEAKER_06]: that's pretty fucking cool right that's
super cool I want to yeah we're yeah we're
[SPEAKER_12]: stoked to kind of uh you know work with
emerald cup on that because uh you know we
[SPEAKER_12]: see you know it's you um you know of the
six primary groups you know once you start
[SPEAKER_12]: seeing how all the data sorts you start
really identifying kind of what defines at
[SPEAKER_12]: what what actually defines rarity versus
overabundance you know beyond just the
[SPEAKER_12]: hype strain of the day name type kind of
way that it goes you know describing you
[SPEAKER_12]: can do as exotic this and that but um you
know by you know we're we're hoping that
[SPEAKER_12]: by sorting it and kind of having judges
judge it in that way you know we're
[SPEAKER_12]: helping to kind of pay pay tribute to the
real diversity of what the plant has to
[SPEAKER_12]: offer you know because you see then kind
of and are able to give tribute to these
[SPEAKER_12]: you know ultra obscure rare profiles that
you know not only aren't really identified
[SPEAKER_12]: as rare but they're not even really
they're they're kind of just masked you
[SPEAKER_12]: know in kind of the the way that the
strain name name game goes you know all
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's just certain things like
awesome take on the take on the popularity
[SPEAKER_06]: of of march madness you know how people
get all all excited about about that
[SPEAKER_06]: college basketball tournament that happens
every march fuck that tournament dude
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes and you can always have like
teams rooting for different terpenes you
[SPEAKER_06]: know you have like the mercene team and
fantasy terpene league i'm on team terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: i don't know about you guys but yeah
that's my team bro that's my team dude
[SPEAKER_05]: dude give me the gas give me the gas you
can have whatever you want give me the gas
[SPEAKER_08]: but again alec again alec just not to
interrupt this is going to be quick i
[SPEAKER_08]: literally was thinking oh samin right
before you said it and i know we had this
[SPEAKER_08]: happen last uh episode as well so go ahead
and mention michael oh no that's epic yeah
[SPEAKER_12]: totally um yeah no i appreciate appreciate
the mind meld we got going um but yeah oh
[SPEAKER_12]: samin i like calling it awesome i mean um
you know it's it's like a kind of a sub
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene that we see either track with
mirror scene or we see traveling with
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene you know and so so usually it's
masked like there'll be like a huge mirror
[SPEAKER_12]: scene peak you know and then like a third
of the third of the profile of the mirror
[SPEAKER_12]: scene peak will be awesome i mean you know
but that profile all of a sudden makes up
[SPEAKER_12]: super skunk mango papaya dream queen green
crack in the pines pineapple you know a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of that subtropical fruit pineapple is
what i associate it with yeah totally
[SPEAKER_12]: totally you know but it's really rare
pineapple whenever i smell pineapple yeah
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah totally and uh and so we but we see
it like less than one percent of the data
[SPEAKER_12]: um um we'll we'll see awesome mean as the
primary dominant terpene and there'll be
[SPEAKER_12]: in absence of mirror scene you know and so
so we see certain you know kind of uh you
[SPEAKER_12]: know a recessive phenos isolated from
certain things like the pines pineapple um
[SPEAKER_12]: just like you're describing that will be
yeah awesome dominant without mirror scene
[SPEAKER_12]: um and then we you know like uh in the
emerald cup a few years ago um green shock
[SPEAKER_12]: farms uh gentleman named mark uh he he won
uh most unique turp award with a strain
[SPEAKER_12]: called tropical sleigh ride and it was an
awesome dominant peak um but yeah so that
[SPEAKER_12]: represents you know because we see what
the way we see it all kind of sort and
[SPEAKER_12]: break down is mirror scene you know like
there is the most overabundant terpene
[SPEAKER_12]: it's like it represents like 43 percent of
all the profiles of what we see um you
[SPEAKER_12]: know so a lot of mercy in that way um and
then um then we see cariophiline is about
[SPEAKER_12]: 23 percent of the data um um limonene is
about 16 17 percent of the data but and
[SPEAKER_12]: but what you'll notice is limonene and
cariophiline usually track together so a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of the most popular strains right now
the gelatos kind of wedding cake dessert
[SPEAKER_12]: type profuminent and limonene and
cariophiline but together those curbs
[SPEAKER_12]: represent about 37 percent of the data um
so they're getting close to mirror scene
[SPEAKER_12]: and you know i i speculate that this year
you know because you see it happen with a
[SPEAKER_12]: name game the way that happens you know a
certain strain like gelato will get
[SPEAKER_12]: incredibly popular and then a few years
later everybody's growing 10 acres of it
[SPEAKER_12]: you know or i mean in literally like i
guess literally in this new licensed world
[SPEAKER_12]: you know and so so so in this hard you
know the market has that profile you know
[SPEAKER_12]: it better be really exemplary you know
kind to even be able to be sold you know
[SPEAKER_12]: and so so you know kind of we're trying to
hope we're hoping that you know the way
[SPEAKER_12]: that we we're coming to understand the way
terpene sort can help in diversifying a
[SPEAKER_12]: portfolio to not get stuck in this like
you know narrow game you know kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: getting caught up in the floods but yeah
so so anyway so sorry so there's mirror
[SPEAKER_12]: scene 43 percent of data cariophiline
limonene together is about 37 percent of
[SPEAKER_12]: the data then terpenoline um is represents
10 percent of the data um um alpha pining
[SPEAKER_12]: so terpenolines like the jack train wreck
sage urban you know uh super lemon haze
[SPEAKER_12]: like that's very it's a tv type terp um
and then alpha pine smell represents about
[SPEAKER_12]: six percent of data and so that's really
rare oftentimes people confuse pining with
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenoline kind of smells a little piney
but you know all those strains kind of the
[SPEAKER_12]: jack train wreck sage don't have any
pining at all in them pretty much but but
[SPEAKER_12]: then there's actually true pine smell
where it's similar to the awesome mean
[SPEAKER_12]: it'll be you know because usually when
pining is present similar to awesome um
[SPEAKER_12]: it's it's in the abs or it's it's uh it's
masked by the amount of mirror scene so
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a lot of mirror scene and a little
bit of pining and that's like blue dream
[SPEAKER_12]: and strains like that um but it's really
it's like less than six percent of the
[SPEAKER_12]: data when it's pining dominant without
mirror scene so we'll see certain strains
[SPEAKER_12]: i'll be like the top three turbines will
be pine alka pining limonene beta pining
[SPEAKER_12]: you know that's a really fascinating
profile too because pining when together
[SPEAKER_12]: with thc helps to decrease the negative
memory impairment effects that thc has in
[SPEAKER_12]: short term um so you know that's just a
rare profile overall so like six percent
[SPEAKER_12]: and then there's the awesome mean profile
which is one percent you know when so but
[SPEAKER_12]: that's you know we we pretty much see you
know from the 160 000 turkey tests that
[SPEAKER_12]: we've done since 2013 2013 um when we
sword worked to sort it all and uh with
[SPEAKER_12]: with some bioinformaticist help uh we came
to see that there's yes six primary
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene groups that really are defined by
the monitor monoterpene content um bennett
[SPEAKER_12]: crofflin is the only dominant terpene
that's a that's not a monoterpene is a
[SPEAKER_12]: sesquiterpene um but but so we see six
primary groups and each primary group has
[SPEAKER_12]: like two to three subgroups but we really
see about like yeah like 13 to 15
[SPEAKER_12]: archetype profiles pretty much dominate
everything we've ever tested in california
[SPEAKER_12]: and oregon you know across our data set
but um yeah go ramble on about that you
[SPEAKER_09]: know which one is a cannabinoid anterpene
um what are you okay well so beta carol
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah beta cariophilin is a cb1
antagonist but that doesn't mean it's a i
[SPEAKER_06]: guess you know again you should draw the
distinction not based on what biological
[SPEAKER_06]: receptors molecules bind to but what the
structures are themselves and just because
[SPEAKER_06]: you know beta cariophilin has activity on
cb2 doesn't mean it's a cannabinoid it's
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid receptor antagonist but you
know yeah yeah it's the only terpene
[SPEAKER_12]: that's known to bind to an endocannabinoid
receptor i think so you know i think so i
[SPEAKER_06]: think there's some other analogs that are
related to beta cariophilin so humaline i
[SPEAKER_06]: think also has some activity like that and
i think that the other oh uh is it
[SPEAKER_12]: cariophilin oxide which i think isn't yeah
totally and isn't isn't humaline like the
[SPEAKER_06]: isomer of beta carophilin did you just say
that yeah humaline yeah yeah humaline and
[SPEAKER_06]: beta cariophilin are related to each other
in the fact that exactly right alec
[SPEAKER_06]: they're isomers of one another and beta
cariophilin has a very peculiar
[SPEAKER_06]: four-membered ring with a very large other
ring where humaline itself just is one
[SPEAKER_06]: large ring so it's the same atoms it's
same tinkertoys just connected at
[SPEAKER_14]: different spots mark doesn't it have three
uh isoprene units yeah which means you get
[SPEAKER_06]: sesquiterpene yes yeah yeah it's a it's a
it's a sesquiterpene i think alec properly
[SPEAKER_06]: said that yeah so sesquiterpenes are c15s
not c10s right and what's really
[SPEAKER_12]: fascinating about because from what we see
is kind of some point of conversation has
[SPEAKER_12]: been going you know the terpenes are
precious and they they're fleeting you
[SPEAKER_12]: know kind of depending how they're they're
they're cared for and preserved and you
[SPEAKER_12]: know the most of the primary attributes
that contribute to the second or tablight
[SPEAKER_12]: expression of the terpene content in the
strain you know are the monoterpenes so
[SPEAKER_12]: limonene so limonene, miracene,
pionene, terpenelene, and awesomene and
[SPEAKER_12]: like lindlule i mean they're you know
we're just some subterpenes and they're
[SPEAKER_12]: they're all monoterpenes and so those are
all the quickest to go away at the lowest
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures even at room temperature
though right so lindlule is the exception
[SPEAKER_06]: to what you said right totally thank you
now i appreciate that terpene because it
[SPEAKER_06]: has a oxygen on it it's reacted with water
so it it's a uh it's what we call a
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoid because you could call it a
terpenol but they're all terpenoid
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoid so geraniol is also another
example camphor yeah uh uh eucalyptol
[SPEAKER_06]: these are all alcohols that are derived
from terpenes reacting with water and now
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporating the water molecule into the
structure of the compound to create a
[SPEAKER_06]: what's called a hydroxyl group which is
notably an alcohol right well and and and
[SPEAKER_12]: you know so so and to to kind of wrap that
you know so so you know really you know so
[SPEAKER_12]: we're testing for like 36 uh terpenes um
and terpenoids uh at sc labs and you know
[SPEAKER_12]: essentially across our entire data set we
really see about five to nine terpenes
[SPEAKER_12]: defined you know 95 plus percent of the
profile of every terpene test we've ever
[SPEAKER_12]: ran right and so you know we test for
eucalyptol and kind of geraniol and
[SPEAKER_12]: certain things um but you know um they're
you know terpenes you'll see any amounts
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of that complement the profile
profile but most of these terpenes you
[SPEAKER_12]: show up in pretty much non you know
non-detect amounts um so it's really
[SPEAKER_12]: fascinating to be able to start to
characterize you know kind of in sort you
[SPEAKER_12]: know kind of everything we've tested by
these you know really five to nine
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes that define the primary and
subgrouping is and how it happens but but
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of um just to kind of wrap the point
on how precious terpenes are you know we
[SPEAKER_12]: see really like from the time of harvest
you know through you know the you know
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of harvest like from the time of dry
to or harvest to cure you know so it's
[SPEAKER_12]: like what time of day are you harvesting
you're harvesting in the middle of the sun
[SPEAKER_12]: you're harvesting in the middle of the
night kind of around the full moon kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: thing you know i think i was hitting on
this before um on uh you know i think last
[SPEAKER_12]: week maybe um but then but then what are
the conditions that are being preserved
[SPEAKER_12]: that are taken to preserve these
monoterpenes because they're the ones that
[SPEAKER_12]: are so fleeting and um and how they've
been being extracted and all that but but
[SPEAKER_12]: but just um i didn't did i did i mention
schwag flag last week no all right cool
[SPEAKER_12]: all right so so so yeah i didn't want to
be very redundant so so it was fascinating
[SPEAKER_12]: because when we started aggregating all
this terpene data that we've tested over
[SPEAKER_12]: the past um you know kind of since 2013 um
you know there was you know everything was
[SPEAKER_12]: sorting in the primary kind of secondary
grouping that we saw everything you know
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of very um predictably sorting to and
um and and then we had like an outlier
[SPEAKER_12]: trigger or like or an outlier flag so if
anything if there was a profile that
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't match kind of these these very
predictable groupings then it would be
[SPEAKER_12]: flagged for secondary review and and
that's where i was most excited to kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: really dive into the data because i was
like oh man that's where the most trippy
[SPEAKER_12]: land race obscure like terpene profiles
are going to be and and um and like within
[SPEAKER_12]: that you know that that data that i was um
you know there's there was a tiny
[SPEAKER_12]: percentage of that data that were super
defined by awesome mean or pining my
[SPEAKER_12]: meaning pining and type like really rare
pro data in there is was the artifact of
[SPEAKER_12]: what we've come to determine a schwag
right and so so so basically when all the
[SPEAKER_12]: mono terpenes and sesquoia terpenes that
really define the value of the profile
[SPEAKER_12]: have gone away and volatilized or or
degraded then the only terpenes that
[SPEAKER_12]: remain are these highest of boiling point
terpenes that end in an ol so like
[SPEAKER_12]: neurolytol bisbalol guaiol phytol right so
so so we came to create this like um this
[SPEAKER_12]: this this uh yeah well so so so basically
whenever and when is there all i love it
[SPEAKER_12]: the track i want to see the swag yeah it's
a strike flag so so so yeah so so we
[SPEAKER_12]: basically um yeah one of all the mono and
sesquoia terpenes are gone there's a
[SPEAKER_12]: condition that we see and it's basically
the pro it'll be less than half a percent
[SPEAKER_12]: total terpene content in the material and
they're only terpenes that are high or
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of you know showing in the expression
of the terpene profile are these terpenes
[SPEAKER_12]: so yeah so that's so so but we just
thought that was really fascinating
[SPEAKER_12]: because you know it just kind of really
dug into just uh discovering i mean it's
[SPEAKER_12]: always how precious the terpenes are and
how they are really what defined quality
[SPEAKER_12]: you know the presence of them with thc and
the cannabinoids and the relation the
[SPEAKER_12]: ratio but whenever the terpenes i mean it
could test 35 percent thc but it could
[SPEAKER_12]: have the swag flag terpenes and guess what
that's like a 90 to 1 terpene to
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid cannabinoid terpene ratio
that's like that to me that's what defines
[SPEAKER_12]: biomass you know like there's no more
value to represent that material in the
[SPEAKER_12]: market other than and to distill it right
you know and so but if it's like 50 thc
[SPEAKER_12]: but it was like harvested it was if it was
grown in living soil and regenerative
[SPEAKER_12]: conditions and the secondary metabolite
production doubled and there's like five
[SPEAKER_12]: percent terpenes in the dry flower because
it was you know harvested around the full
[SPEAKER_12]: moon at night and dried cured preserved
immaculately you know that's like five
[SPEAKER_12]: percent turps and dried flower so it's
like 15 that's a three to one cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_14]: terpene ratio right now how that's gonna
how does even though i play a role you
[SPEAKER_12]: know that has to offer in nothing totally
i mean you know they're definitely having
[SPEAKER_12]: a role in the flavor um and you know kind
of uh you know we're all kind of okay i
[SPEAKER_12]: guess like um for your i guess your you
know your that type of that area of your
[SPEAKER_12]: sensory system um but we are starting to
develop some testing for additional
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes and um some trace compounds like
flavonoid is in uh files and all actors um
[SPEAKER_12]: but um but yeah it's it's interesting
because you know we see you know like of
[SPEAKER_12]: everything we've tested you know we're
like we're we're separating and
[SPEAKER_12]: identifying the primary majority of
everything that's there in the
[SPEAKER_12]: chromatograph you know but but the time
you will see these little unknown kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: tiny peaks you know in the chromatograms
of these certain things that we're not
[SPEAKER_12]: testing for you know because each terpene
each time we test terpenes you know we we
[SPEAKER_12]: have a runtime you see columns of over 90
minutes per test per sample you know and
[SPEAKER_12]: we do that so we can get as much
separation of each compound so that we can
[SPEAKER_12]: see all the trait you know so we have no
coalition and that we can make sure that
[SPEAKER_12]: each peak and each you know is what we're
actually testing for but you know from
[SPEAKER_12]: time to time yeah we do see these little
certain trace peaks and certain compounds
[SPEAKER_12]: you know and my one of my partner is jeff
gray he kind of it's interesting because
[SPEAKER_12]: he likens it to you know if you if you're
making a soup you know and you have all
[SPEAKER_12]: these ingredients and spices you know it's
like you know certain certain all things
[SPEAKER_12]: aren't created equal because you know you
can take a teaspoon of salt and throw into
[SPEAKER_12]: the soup and maybe barely affect the taste
but you can take a teaspoon of cumin and
[SPEAKER_12]: throw it in the soup and it just
completely changed the overall profile
[SPEAKER_12]: right you know and so so even though these
certain trace kind of compounds might not
[SPEAKER_12]: by makeup profile you know clearly they
are having huge contributions to the
[SPEAKER_12]: overall you know flavor and aroma you know
certain things like you know there it's
[SPEAKER_12]: believed that like uh the the gas the the
fuel the gas skunk terp are in fact skunk
[SPEAKER_12]: terps you know like like thials are skunk
terp or terpenes from skunk and so you
[SPEAKER_12]: know because you can take the og kush or
gorilla goo or what have you profile
[SPEAKER_12]: headband profile and you know you could
recreate that you know mixing botanical
[SPEAKER_12]: terps or what have you you're not even
getting close to the smell of that gas
[SPEAKER_12]: purely kind of c type profile right yeah
i've never so so it's any certain things
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe you know that are doing that so it
sounds to me like your your your
[SPEAKER_14]: correlation between harvest times uh
temperature relative humidity in which
[SPEAKER_14]: your your uh your drying and your cures um
play a major role in all the different
[SPEAKER_14]: varietals that you're seeing come through
and all the different tests that you're
[SPEAKER_14]: seeing across the board through the years
it's now i have a question are certain
[SPEAKER_14]: varieties uh historically just speaking
broadleaf and narrowleaf uh are you seeing
[SPEAKER_14]: the hybrids or certain varieties that come
through um test higher consistency because
[SPEAKER_14]: i would imagine that you're seeing many
different types of quote-unquote headbands
[SPEAKER_14]: come come through um and many different
types of test results come through because
[SPEAKER_14]: of all these said you know points that you
you've brought up such as you know the
[SPEAKER_14]: medium when you actually harvested how
long you know it went for um is there
[SPEAKER_14]: anything that you you can share that
you've seen um that may point to uh a more
[SPEAKER_12]: hey you should do more of this and less of
that um well so on the on the expression
[SPEAKER_12]: side of things within the plant you know i
mean that's very kind of i've so much like
[SPEAKER_12]: love and respect you know for the reality
of the soil food web and dr laningham and
[SPEAKER_12]: and and just how much kind of cannabis
farmers have really put you know organic
[SPEAKER_12]: farming potential and how to grow that how
to grow plants optimally by understanding
[SPEAKER_12]: the soil microbiology it's like that i
mean we i feel like laningham has kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: received like saint status from you know
cannabis farmers that have now brought her
[SPEAKER_12]: so much more legitimacy as a
microbiologist in the world microbiology
[SPEAKER_12]: than she's ever had you know and and and
is helping elevate the potential of
[SPEAKER_12]: farming you know she shows that through
you know when you find the right fungal
[SPEAKER_12]: bacterial ratio you know that you're
cultivating the plant under you know then
[SPEAKER_12]: you can i you know it seems like cannabis
is one-to-one in that way from the little
[SPEAKER_12]: i remember you know from kind of you know
how deep i was on it back in the day but
[SPEAKER_12]: you know she's been showing side by side
by you know with hydroponic kind of or
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever other type of cultivation method
you know she's been showing and
[SPEAKER_12]: substantiating ability of you know farming
to produce um and influence secondary
[SPEAKER_12]: metabolite production so you know with
tomatoes she's been able to see like
[SPEAKER_12]: doubling of secondary metabolite a content
from lycopene you know whenever you have
[SPEAKER_12]: this soil microbiome you know like really
respected and worked out expression is
[SPEAKER_12]: going to you know the whole conversation
around appellations of origin you know is
[SPEAKER_12]: going to it's not just going to come down
to regionality or you know it's going to
[SPEAKER_12]: come down to the farm conditions specific
and how the plants are being grown or how
[SPEAKER_12]: the soil conditions are being created um
it's because there's that side of it and
[SPEAKER_12]: then you know there's you know then
there's the preservation side of it you
[SPEAKER_12]: know we're working with certain groups
that are doing live resin live resin like
[SPEAKER_12]: live rosin harvesting right so they're you
know they're they have the teams and
[SPEAKER_12]: they're going out in the fields and
they're you know harvesting the plants and
[SPEAKER_12]: prepping them and kind of getting the
freezers immediately you know and it's
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of where you know we've been working
with them to where they're harvesting kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of in the middle of the night or you know
early in the morning right before the sun
[SPEAKER_12]: comes up as opposed to you know in the
middle of the you know peak heat of that
[SPEAKER_12]: afternoon and you know we're you know just
from kind of the return in the extraction
[SPEAKER_12]: process and just difference on the terpene
content itself you know whenever there's
[SPEAKER_12]: these certain considerations around you
know harvest time of you know around the
[SPEAKER_12]: moon cycle around the you know these you
know these you know just ensuring that the
[SPEAKER_12]: temperatures that you're exposing the
plant to during time of harvest and then
[SPEAKER_12]: throughout the process of drying curing
yeah you know ever you know reaching these
[SPEAKER_12]: certain temperatures where you're going to
be compromising the terps yeah i always
[SPEAKER_14]: see you know you need to be around 68
relative humidity 55 or you know or or and
[SPEAKER_14]: or throttling it really paying attention
to the material is super super key um
[SPEAKER_14]: there's no silver bullet to try cure it's
all very very specific to that time and
[SPEAKER_14]: that varietal or that variety i should say
so hey there was a question for you sam
[SPEAKER_08]: have you ever smoked isolated novel
phytocannabinoids like 331-18b is that
[SPEAKER_04]: like a synthetic cannabinoid like uh like
hold on yeah i'm smoking some right now
[SPEAKER_04]: you're hitting that 331-18b right now well
actually it's uh b3 right i figure it
[SPEAKER_08]: sounds like it is a synthetic cannabinoid
alec and uh you know what that shit scares
[SPEAKER_08]: me it scares me too kind of i kind of like
certified by mother nature for a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetics is people haven't taken a very
long we don't know if they're safe maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: they are maybe they're not but uh yeah i
only have one brain to play with so try to
[SPEAKER_10]: be safe with it as we and by safe go ahead
as we say yeah i mean i think like factor
[SPEAKER_12]: is large what's that alec um i was i was
just gonna add like you know in the world
[SPEAKER_12]: of like these like synthetic compounds or
analog compounds off of the original
[SPEAKER_12]: molecule you know synthetic cannabinoids
do scare the shit out of me but it's
[SPEAKER_12]: fascinating you know how something like
met the compound of mescaline and then the
[SPEAKER_12]: compound of 2 cv you know 2 cv is
incredible incredible medicine and gift of
[SPEAKER_12]: alexander shulgin bless his soul um you
know and you know and that's you know
[SPEAKER_12]: seems incredibly you know safe and
effective in you know kind of controlling
[SPEAKER_12]: dose and you know effect um but but you
know it's fascinating how these end of
[SPEAKER_12]: these synthetic cannabinoids you know that
are largely untested or just they have
[SPEAKER_12]: such rate of effects that can be you know
half hazardous or negative to use i think
[SPEAKER_09]: often with those compounds they have a
potential long-term degenerative effect if
[SPEAKER_09]: overused in the case of mdma and 2 cv that
their um micro dosing capabilities and
[SPEAKER_09]: their euphoric and their their dips into a
you know a calm you know meditative place
[SPEAKER_09]: is as exceptionally beneficial and it's
amazing medicine in in the overuse of it
[SPEAKER_09]: or say the non you know pharmaceutical
ways that you may get it can definitely
[SPEAKER_09]: have a degenerative effect on your neuro
neurological system so i think it's always
[SPEAKER_09]: safe to say that the the the plant
compound itself is going to be the one
[SPEAKER_09]: that's going to be healthy for your you
know corrective you know therapy that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're looking for well apparently the 33
whatever 18b was isolated by dr dd mary
[SPEAKER_08]: mieri from a plant in technician lab
israel so it wasn't a synthetic one it's
[SPEAKER_08]: isolated from a plant it's hermatia
elucins who's in the chat room talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about 140 different cannabinoids been
found in the plant is my understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: mark probably has better number actual but
yeah there's all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that the cannabis plant makes
and i want to throw out that i think that
[SPEAKER_01]: uh the real beauty of the cannabis plant
is that it comes with this whole soup of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and other cannabinoids and that's
where some of the benefit and magic of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant really resides blessed be yeah and
things like mda i totally agree with that
[SPEAKER_06]: you know the other the other compounds
that we were talking about before like the
[SPEAKER_06]: the hallucinogenic compounds and so like
if you're familiar with sasha shogan's
[SPEAKER_06]: book so the p book so the phenethylamines
that i have known and loved and so um the
[SPEAKER_06]: the phenethylamines are similar to things
like el dopo which naturally exists in
[SPEAKER_06]: your brain and and epinephrine and related
compounds and so there are our natural
[SPEAKER_06]: enzymes in the brain that regulate these
these compounds and you'll know that like
[SPEAKER_06]: people who are who are diagnosed with
clinical depression will be giving
[SPEAKER_06]: something that are called mao inhibitors
and so mao is stands for monoamine oxidase
[SPEAKER_06]: and monoamine oxidase is an regulatory
enzyme that exists in the brain to
[SPEAKER_06]: basically degrade these compounds and to
regulate how much exists in critical
[SPEAKER_06]: synaptic junctions that are responsible
for the underlying causes of depression
[SPEAKER_06]: and so the other thing that you have to
think about like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: mdma before and microdosing it's
interesting because microdosing seems to
[SPEAKER_06]: tap some different level and function of
these compounds in the brain that's not
[SPEAKER_06]: quite well understood as opposed to the
guy who goes to the rave every weekend and
[SPEAKER_06]: just takes as much ecstasy as he could
possibly swallow i mean at some point
[SPEAKER_06]: again you're saturating your body's
ability to basically degrade these
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds and because they look like
compounds that are related to things that
[SPEAKER_06]: are naturally in the brain they're
metabolized and then reuptake
[SPEAKER_06]: presynaptically and so the whole basis of
the whole acid flashback which is where
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody just took so much psychedelics
and now presynaptically they've sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: reincorporated these compounds which at
one point flooded the synapse is now
[SPEAKER_06]: coming back and sort of again the basis of
the whole acid flashback is the
[SPEAKER_06]: reincorporation and utilization of these
molecules that you can definitely alter
[SPEAKER_06]: your brain chemistry incredibly i mean i
used to know kids on a dead tour who just
[SPEAKER_06]: took way too much of these things and they
just became like walking vegetables like
[SPEAKER_06]: they had no like they were more like a
meth head than like somebody who just
[SPEAKER_06]: smoked weed or did psychedelics they they
became more kind of like of what you would
[SPEAKER_06]: see for somebody who had a real
methamphetamine addiction as they got sid
[SPEAKER_10]: barretted the inability to to have emotion
or show emotion it just became so vanilla
[SPEAKER_10]: you know it's very strange yeah i noticed
and i think your body begins to depend on
[SPEAKER_06]: this almost there's a dependency that um
is probably underpicked underpins the
[SPEAKER_06]: addiction to them but i don't think
cannabis i think cannabis is kind of like
[SPEAKER_06]: again for that to me is like the exit drug
it's like you can still get the euphoric
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling that you get on psychedelics
without completely losing your shit by
[SPEAKER_06]: just having the right type of cannabis i
think cannabis product and i know it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: completely different set of molecules but
it's acting on the same it's a different
[SPEAKER_06]: set of uh software but it's acting on the
same computer you know it's you're you're
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not doing things that are the thing
with psychedelics and again it's so
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting how when you look at the
chemistry of psychedelics how they're very
[SPEAKER_06]: often these phenethylamine type
derivatives if you look at the if you look
[SPEAKER_06]: at the structure of lsd itself you could
actually see in in the case of lsd that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's an indole ring which basically
defines the molecule itself but you could
[SPEAKER_06]: basically map a molecule of phenethylamine
right over the top of those and you could
[SPEAKER_06]: see where they could fit in the same same
receptors kind of like as you know puzzles
[SPEAKER_06]: puzzle pieces fitting together so it's
really cool interesting conversation no
[SPEAKER_08]: doubt we've got uh we've got 15 minutes
left i've got a hard stop at noon today
[SPEAKER_08]: i'm going to be hiking up the mountain
behind my house and going and seeing the
[SPEAKER_08]: enchanted forest that's up there we had a
little girl in our neighborhood here some
[SPEAKER_08]: years back now who was hiking in the
forest with a bunch of people and i guess
[SPEAKER_08]: a boulder shifted and crushed her and
ended her life she was very young i think
[SPEAKER_08]: seven or eight years old and so they've
created her parents created a really
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful enchanted forest way up in
behind the house and there's all sorts of
[SPEAKER_08]: little mushroom sculptures and little
people go there and bring little things
[SPEAKER_08]: that they make uh from memories that they
had with aaron and the family and so i'm
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be taking my family up there
later today and honoring aaron and
[SPEAKER_08]: celebrating her life as well as just
enjoying the forest with my family so uh
[SPEAKER_08]: 15 more minutes 14 more minutes than a
hard stop so whatever you do guys don't
[SPEAKER_08]: get into an incredibly interesting
conversation in the next 12 minutes please
[SPEAKER_08]: or if you do wrap it up in those 12
minutes well hey what what's everybody
[SPEAKER_10]: smoking on today just keep it light and
lively and for fun and giggles we haven't
[SPEAKER_10]: done it in a long time but what are you
smoking on in chat well let's see what
[SPEAKER_08]: they say it's going to happen fast
strawberry guava grapefruit urban sugar
[SPEAKER_12]: lemon kush mints georgia pie with some
mature noble library we've got some dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sift uh cash's honey cross with canna sue
and it's a kind of a type two blend that
[SPEAKER_08]: tastes really lovely this afternoon oh
that sounds nice i got some mendo breath
[SPEAKER_08]: from the dragonfly earth medicine i've got
some concentrated x cookies and cream hash
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin as well as some full melt bubble
strawberry banana as well as some full
[SPEAKER_08]: melt bubble rosin from strawberry banana
all from concentrated x i got a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: of los gardens in the house got a little
of that kayas coffee grown organically and
[SPEAKER_08]: regeneratively out in the east side of the
country over in ontario and a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: of grateful heads i got a little bit of
the jagger so you know shout out to the uh
[SPEAKER_08]: eugene family that jagger and everyone's
hitting it's like icy sweet skunk dreaming
[SPEAKER_08]: diesel crazy train cheese force zittle's
breath dead orange dry sift afgoo uh cream
[SPEAKER_08]: and sugar sojay haze banana og gmo punch
sfv og wedding cake chem dog bean og i
[SPEAKER_08]: mean holy shit straw nana times triple sec
from stafely farms mother's milk crossed
[SPEAKER_08]: with wookie 15 there is some incredible
names blue gelato 41 sticky barb that's
[SPEAKER_08]: always a fun question to ask because truly
there's probably like four three four
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred people in the chat room right now
almost 500 actually so that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people puffing on a lot of things and i
wonder imagine if we all just puffed a
[SPEAKER_08]: gram during this church we would have
consumed half a kilo of concentrates with
[SPEAKER_08]: just our panel and the 500 people who are
watching on the show that's uh that's
[SPEAKER_14]: pretty cool anyway i've some triangle kush
here some uh triangle wave some lemon cake
[SPEAKER_14]: some chopped cookies i got a gift here of
some flour that i typically don't have a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of and this is uh i believe uh i think
this is uh cookies and cream i believe but
[SPEAKER_08]: uh so much good stuff out there super
silver haze crossed with great white shark
[SPEAKER_08]: old school ak-47 grinspoon crossed with
the nevels haze bubblegum crossed with
[SPEAKER_08]: bodega gmo and straw guava larry bird
vanilla frosting mac and cheese rosin chem
[SPEAKER_08]: de la chem garlic juice it actually just
puts a smile on my face to read all of
[SPEAKER_08]: this right now has the world not come a
long way mac and cheese rosin where am i
[SPEAKER_10]: missing something here this is a diversity
of genetics and access that people have
[SPEAKER_10]: compared to you know a decade ago and to
see all this it's amazing i love it and
[SPEAKER_10]: thank you all for making it all happen and
all y'all watching it for perpetuating it
[SPEAKER_02]: y 'all are awesome yeah i got this great
little run-up here i got lindsey og og
[SPEAKER_02]: kush wedding cake girl scope cookies girl
woo number four and bubba kush like that's
[SPEAKER_08]: just a nice little package it's beautiful
not too shabby i will say johnny b not too
[SPEAKER_02]: shabby package right there big foot look
at that and and i went i went to local
[SPEAKER_02]: stone i picked up this og cam dog and you
know what it's it's og cam dog it's fire
[SPEAKER_08]: evergreen's hitting that skunk ran over by
a blueberry truck with a burning tire
[SPEAKER_08]: how's that that's like i want to i want to
be over at evergreen's house hitting a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of that with just a hint of
burning tire you have to really cut
[SPEAKER_08]: through the dead skunk in the blueberry
truck to get to that burning tire sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: off off rubber taste yeah i loved it i'm
smoking more rubber band the better that's
[SPEAKER_08]: bad the more rubber band the better listen
guava punch i could do a whole show on
[SPEAKER_08]: alec talking about the terpenes and the
groups that they fit into man like i'm
[SPEAKER_08]: telling you i'm sure that's probably i
really would love to see you standing in
[SPEAKER_08]: front of a board one day with them all
written out and circles and put a book out
[SPEAKER_08]: or something like make that information
available because it's priceless and i
[SPEAKER_08]: personally will be going through
everything you said later and kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: creating my own little graph with that
because there's uh there's value in that
[SPEAKER_12]: i'll send you send you some cool uh cool
cool stuff we have a presentation vibe um
[SPEAKER_12]: for sure we just yeah we we've launched
this like vital fact report so when you
[SPEAKER_12]: know that's the foundation of a term
classification system cool man very cool
[SPEAKER_00]: hey alec i know that they were um emerald
cup is going to do an indoor certification
[SPEAKER_00]: as well are you all going to be having
intake of that i've not certification
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor competition um as well are you guys
going to be able to intake with terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios like that because that would be
really phenomenal to see the difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes from the sun grown that you're
working on and then move over to an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: competition with the terpenes is that in
the in the mix it's coming up um well so
[SPEAKER_12]: so so we're we're terpene cannabinoid
testing all flower entries across
[SPEAKER_12]: categories so and the emerald cup is doing
indoor this year for the first time and um
[SPEAKER_12]: and they are also kind of paying tribute
and recognition to third party certified
[SPEAKER_12]: organic type farms you know kind of dem
certified and all those others around and
[SPEAKER_12]: um so it'll be really interesting you know
to kind of analyze and see see you know
[SPEAKER_12]: both you know from from flower you know
grown indoors sun grown across but just to
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of compare some of the data around
terpene cannabinoid expression compared to
[SPEAKER_12]: amine across all the other data um and yes
you're stoked to connect and share more
[SPEAKER_12]: about that i'd love to show you some more
on this terpene system too so i'm super
[SPEAKER_09]: into seeing some like alex gray style
sacred g like meta terpene cannabinoid art
[SPEAKER_09]: you know where we start seeing where the
terpene profile filed over fire whoa but
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway the uh the terpene profile
overlapped over the cannabinoid and how
[SPEAKER_09]: that creates the effect because it's not
just you know a high terpene makes you
[SPEAKER_09]: feel a certain way because it's mixed with
the cannabinoids so really it's like this
[SPEAKER_09]: total shamanic fractal medicine that we're
dealing with because like in in gill's
[SPEAKER_09]: case or someone who's you know say growing
from all seed you know every one of those
[SPEAKER_09]: plants are going to have some fractal
epigenetic difference you know and it
[SPEAKER_09]: would just be really cool to be able to
overlap the two i don't know you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also breed with you know the real
putting terpenes out front breeding in
[SPEAKER_00]: accordance with terpenes because i think
it's really interesting that we took our
[SPEAKER_00]: two highest lemonine slash terpenaline
strains on the property and it came out
[SPEAKER_00]: like so not lemony just like awesomene
really earthy gassy every single time no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what so it'd be really awesome to
talk about like the marriage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene genes and then what they turn into
but maybe that's the great unknown
[SPEAKER_09]: genetics and breeding it's the great
unknown but it's also you're kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: creating the turpetta stone you know for
us to be able to speak terpenes you know
[SPEAKER_00]: so we look to you for guidance yeah thank
you thank you for being there alex we love
[SPEAKER_09]: you yeah that's awesome
[SPEAKER_14]: um kelly i i noticed a difference um from
growing a lot of these uh east coast you
[SPEAKER_14]: know chem dogs our indoor and outdoor um a
major difference in profiles from outdoor
[SPEAKER_14]: to indoor um sour diesel might be one of
the hardest varieties to actually grow
[SPEAKER_14]: well indoors um from growing a lot of it
over a long period of time and i prefer
[SPEAKER_14]: the outdoor to be honest and greenhouse
grown um version of it it's um there's
[SPEAKER_14]: nothing else quite like it to be honest
and i i stand behind that i have to try
[SPEAKER_14]: that then yeah it's it's fascinating but i
see it i see it well i say it's been a
[SPEAKER_08]: wonderful show i sure appreciate everyone
