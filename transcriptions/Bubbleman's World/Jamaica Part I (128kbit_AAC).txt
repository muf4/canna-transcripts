[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here, and I am in
beautiful Negril, Jamaica, sitting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cliffs right now at a really beautiful
place called The Sundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice yellow and green and orange condo
that they have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just next to Catch a Falling Star,
fairly far down the cliff road,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost at the lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, for those of you that are
familiar with Jamaica and Negril,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been here about three or four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on a family vacation,
so I haven't been filming much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have been trying to organize getting
some nice filming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bumped into King Shiloh yesterday out on
the road, one of the local artists,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he introduced me to the medicine man,
Gussie Clark, who I had never actually met
[SPEAKER_01]: before, but was friends with some of my
other friends like Red, who you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen on the Steam Chalice video,
and Bongo Roach, another local medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they said that they were going to
help us organize a gathering of rasta,
[SPEAKER_01]: elder rastas, as well as medicine man
rastas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to try and do an interview
with both of those groups of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially together, potentially
separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I'm going to be covering
the World's International Canvas Cup
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happening here on the 12th to the
15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole slew of people coming
over for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the meantime, I thought we
would start it off with a few dabs of some
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful rosin that I just have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, unfortunately, have a minor
disaster with my sapphire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dropped it just a few seconds ago and
smashed it into oblivion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily, the good people at D-Nail had
sent me a quartz version as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the quartz is brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sitting hot and heavy at about 640
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why don't we start this off with a
little rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll take you guys for a walk down
by the water, show you the cliff real
[SPEAKER_01]: quick, and then I'll try and fill in the
rest of the show with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: adventure here throughout the day here in
the grill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start it out with a nice wake and
bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprising how stable this rosin is
sitting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be 85 plus degrees for you
Americans, 31 degrees Celsius for you
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think we're ready for the rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh off the quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn nice taste off the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hitting the sapphire for so
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slightly different taste for sure,
as I know this resin quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got our bags of Q-tips for some quick
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just cleans up the majority of that
leftover resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was funny when someone told
me it was called the Zamboni tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's a tech, even taking a Q-tip
and wiping your bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I wanted to shout out the Fire Bros
for passing me these slick pads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very much like an oil slick pad,
but I guess they're their own little
[SPEAKER_01]: version of it with their graphics on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been coming in quite handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the length of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can fit three pieces of glass on it at
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer it to the square units.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely something to be said
for the rectangular units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I think we're going to head down
to the water, give you guys a little view
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cliffs and the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little bit rough today,
not as quiet as it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was snorkeling in there the other day
with my son and we saw a beautiful sea
[SPEAKER_01]: turtle, which is quite a lucky sight if
you're ever in Jamaica and you're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you see them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been coming for 20 years and I've
never seen one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really stoked to see one and
hopefully we can get the GoPro down into
[SPEAKER_01]: the water and we can show you some of that
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned for Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a whole week and a
half of awesome Jamaican fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take you to some
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take you to some unique
tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've rented myself a bus, so I'll probably
be doing a couple of pickups at the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport of people that are coming in for
the high times cup and just going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: an all around great time and enjoy the
vibes here in Jamaica mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so this is our little zone on the
cliffs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a beautiful little spot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice drop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are down by the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what better way to get into the
cliffs than a nice little jump in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's what I call a wake up
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call a wake up call.
