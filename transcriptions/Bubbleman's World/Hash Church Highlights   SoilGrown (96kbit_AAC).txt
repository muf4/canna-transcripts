[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: What made you squish that first bud in the
parchment, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it all comes down to I'm a hash
fiend, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting low on my melts, I really
started playing around with it when it
[SPEAKER_00]: came to my no-melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started running and getting low on my
melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started messing with my no-melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember looking back to one time
when I pressed, I over pressed the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that the oils were separated
from the rest of the hash, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think anything of it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of put it back together,
folded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some pressed hash, dabbed it to what
it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some three-star dabbing like three-star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I got low on my melts, that's when I
really thought about it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broke out the flattener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when I started flattening
the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed the rosin coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I would collect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, and what brought you to the hair
curler?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what made you use that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see someone using that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you just?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the idea came from Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen him using a hair straightener just
for pressing the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was rubbing it over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top of my nail so I can press it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using a lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemed like a much better idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't have a hair iron at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just took my lady's straightener or
curler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like following it back and seeing the
influences, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole flower, you know,
pressing the flowers and getting the oils
[SPEAKER_00]: from that, that just came.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, luck has a lot to
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do with it, the simple fact of running
out of no-melts now, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to start washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just playing around, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sitting here with my
father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it between the straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I squeezed it as hard as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think anything was going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my surprise, I seen the oils around the
flat bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scraped them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it a couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we dabbed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sweet.
