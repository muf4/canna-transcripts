[SPEAKER_09]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here with Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys may have seen him on Hash Church
the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for coming by.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a pleasure man.
[SPEAKER_09]: To Hash Church and thanks for having me by
here at your abode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm super excited to talk to you about a
few different things and we've got a
[SPEAKER_09]: couple of ships on the table so we can get
some sublimating and de-nailing while we
[SPEAKER_09]: discuss some things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool having you on Hash
Church the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always known you've had a deep
knowledge of different historical contexts
[SPEAKER_09]: where cannabis has found itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I appreciate about that
historical context is that you look for it
[SPEAKER_09]: from other sources other than cannabis
authors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well I don't want to be quoting
cannabis advocates so I'm looking more at
[SPEAKER_03]: archaeologists work, anthropologists work,
history of religions, religious texts and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that and digging around those
and then trying to accumulate them and put
[SPEAKER_03]: them in one place where people can access
that information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I heard your bird coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my bird mimics the cough and inhale
so he'll be making a bit of noise in the
[SPEAKER_03]: background.
[SPEAKER_09]: His bird takes hits and then coughs after
the exhale.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty funny and I just heard it
right before he explained that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris has a bunch of cool little things to
show us and I figured we'd probably get
[SPEAKER_09]: the party started by having a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always down for a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too big a dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly I vaporize raw cannabis and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like rolling up an oil snake with a dab
and putting that in a joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes a nice really smooth burning
joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always picture you with a joint myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you say there, kitty?
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a beautiful cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a bangal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part wild jungle cat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can kind of tell it definitely
doesn't look like your average house cat.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll come check us out when he feels damn
good and ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: So is this some hash you made?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is hash from a friend, a local friend
up north of Whistler and it's some pretty
[SPEAKER_09]: melty stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see it's of a cush variety with a
tiny little bit of nebula.
[SPEAKER_09]: It presses up real nice into a goopy sort
of sticky melty product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us each a nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: We could probably just do a dunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even need a dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things when I interviewed
Lawrence Czerniak told me that when he was
[SPEAKER_03]: documenting hashish making in the 70s and
stuff like that, generally the hash wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: off of buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the type of buds we see, it was more
like almost plants in vegetative state or
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very spindly buds and the hash,
the very restness though for some reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they weren't producing the big dense
flowers that we traditionally associate
[SPEAKER_03]: our hashish plants with here, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just took a hit out of the
mothership and it was a dry hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was okay though, I have to say,
like really smooth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't cough at all and I tasted beautiful
flavor on the angler.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exhale.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to go put a little bit of
water in though.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got a nice lovely dry hit out of
that, but I have since put some water in
[SPEAKER_09]: it for Chris.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was surprised at how nice the pipe hit
without water.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have hit that one without water and I've
hit my Taurus without water, both
[SPEAKER_09]: motherships.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if you're big on the mothership
scenario here, but these are particular
[SPEAKER_09]: pipes that are made by this company,
mothership.
[SPEAKER_09]: And well, they just really hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you smoke a lot of bongs, you really
recognize it quickly as an incredible
[SPEAKER_09]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put your phone right on the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a dunk for you here.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grab that guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get that in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really quite jealous of your smoking
blazer that you've got on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That thing looks pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_09]: 1920s?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the idea of having a Legends of
Hash party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the idea of having a Legends of
Hash party and at the door you get one of
[SPEAKER_09]: these like smoking jackets, you know,
with a little like maybe some wipes in the
[SPEAKER_09]: pocket and some whatever you require in
the other pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully some selection of hash-oosh in
your pocket or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it was just one little,
you know, your first dab, you just pull it
[SPEAKER_09]: out of your pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're utopian dreamers.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been involved in cannabis for 25
plus years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1989, he found out about Industrial
Hemp and Jack Hair and all that stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: started kind of promoting it from then on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that would have been very similar to
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was definitely into smoking of it in
1989.
[SPEAKER_09]: By 90, 91, I started to grow it and become
more of an activist and then got into the
[SPEAKER_09]: whole hemp thing out east before I came
out here and it was definitely,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's been a good foundation to have that
sort of.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack really brought more of us together
than we'll ever know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, Jack, yeah, he's the father of
the modern movement, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking herbs since I was 12
years old and grew up here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually went to smoke-ins at the
art gallery in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, grassy Jack?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know, I can't remember too
much about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of can vaguely remember being
there and smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big crowd of people, you know,
and so that, but it kind of died off and
[SPEAKER_03]: through the 80s and stuff like that,
through the efforts of a mother of some
[SPEAKER_03]: child, all the head shops got shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all pipes, bongs and high times,
grow magazines, any literature promoting
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization was completely banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was not really much of a
scene here in BC at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1990, when I started promoting it,
I didn't know anybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe Paul D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Police out in Nelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Holy Smokes guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Holy Smokes guys out in Nelson was
doing a bit of promotion out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I had to kind of search that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He definitely, they were for sure because
we were connected to them in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how that connection happened was one
of their good, old time friends and
[SPEAKER_09]: partners, Alan Middlemas.
[SPEAKER_09]: He came to Manitoba and moved there for a
while with his family.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's when he got involved with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were all involved in the Manitoba Hemp
movement together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so of course, when we went to the
Kootenays from Manitoba, who would we go
[SPEAKER_09]: see?
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd go see the Holy Smokes guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd go see Paul.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd go see Dustin Sunflower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are good times indeed, a memory of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I met Dana Larson as well,
you know, the other, well known BC
[SPEAKER_03]: activist too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like at SFU and he had a group
league for ethical action and drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had this thing called Patriotic
Canadians for hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had like one little piece of hemp
paper, you know, cardboard and a little
[SPEAKER_03]: swath of hemp cloth and a bag of hemp
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd go to these universities and
colleges and I'd say, okay, this is hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: paper and we could make all our paper out
of hemp and hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of how it really got
going.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so what year would have been the
hemp times that that brother V World guy
[SPEAKER_09]: was always having?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like 92, three, four.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, 92, 93, 94.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that's when I started coming here
was right around 92, I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we hooked up with them and we had,
you know, it was like we were,
[SPEAKER_09]: we were able to get hemp paper in large
amounts and some hemp cloth that we later
[SPEAKER_09]: found out was not really hemp cloth.
[SPEAKER_09]: The tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had a business moment because hemp
seed treats through a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first commercial venture
of wholesaling hemp seed foods,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sold those all over North America,
the US, even in other continents.
[SPEAKER_09]: We bought them and sold them at our hemp
store.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was like one of the things we
were the most stoked of.
[SPEAKER_09]: We often had the Mama Indica hemp seed
treats opened up, broken into pieces on a
[SPEAKER_09]: table so people could try them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they didn't have the hemp nut,
which really revolutionized the hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp seed itself is kind of husky to
eat in its raw form.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Mama Indica hemp seed treat,
it was kind of a sesame seed snap type
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of worked for it, but it was,
it was holding it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once they figured a method of
properly de-hauling the seed, the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: industry blew.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was even more everything than you can
imagine because the seed that was being
[SPEAKER_09]: used prior was actually sterilized seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were unable to sell live seed to one
of their tricks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was hell, you know, like I was
importing all the seed I got from China
[SPEAKER_03]: and sometimes the seed would show up and
be rancid and that'd be out my money or it
[SPEAKER_03]: would get held in customs forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I saw them renting a bakery to
make my product that and I can't get it or
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a lot of road to break through
to kind of get things going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the hemp industry, you know,
it's a real money industry and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_03]: it's already a multi-million dollar
industry here in British Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and the hemp nuts great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I throw like four tablespoons of my
morning smoothie every day and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely a big part of my diet and the
healthier things that I eat, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, as it should be, you know,
essential amino acids have that word
[SPEAKER_09]: essential in front of it and I'm sure one
day we'll see that word get put in front
[SPEAKER_09]: of phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, probably one day they'll be
juicing whole buds with seeds in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and getting all the cannabis
goodness out of all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's a juicing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Juice your oil from your seed and your
phyto-cannabinoids from the leaf and the
[SPEAKER_09]: bud simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, in 1990, I guess like
where I differentiate from a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: activists is I've pursued this study of
cannabis and its different religious roles
[SPEAKER_03]: in all throughout cultures and religions,
you know, and that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had this really powerful religious
experience in 1990 that left me believing
[SPEAKER_03]: that cannabis was the tree of life,
this, you know, holy tree of life that had
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves for the healing of the nations and
all manners of fruit and stuff and I
[SPEAKER_03]: really felt that after this experience
that all these industrial applications of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis were related to this,
you know, how we can get rid of our
[SPEAKER_03]: petrochemical needs and fossil fuels and
all that with hemp fuels and hemp plastics
[SPEAKER_03]: or how we can feed the world with a hemp
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Replace and soil the pleating cotton with
hemp, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's always been kind of what I
guess is my specialty in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: scene over the last 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I spent 25 years researching the role
of cannabis in history and religion,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly its role in magic and
religion and I have to say, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 years later, that original religious
experience at a time when I had never
[SPEAKER_03]: written anything, my high school dropout,
I hadn't been particularly a pursuer of
[SPEAKER_03]: intellectual type of things and when I,
you know, at that time I was a surfer
[SPEAKER_03]: living out on the west coast of Vancouver
Island and as much as I'm a pot activist
[SPEAKER_03]: now, I was a surfer then.
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole trip was like it grew a bit of
weed and had a job as a night watchman a
[SPEAKER_03]: few nights a week and it was like chasing
waves, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a really good time in Canada
for a surfer and there was like maybe like
[SPEAKER_03]: a dozen surfers between Euclid and Tofino
and now there's probably a dozen surf
[SPEAKER_03]: shots between Euclid and Tofino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was like a pioneering time for
cold water surfing and a really great
[SPEAKER_03]: scene, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you know, I'd say that as fun as
that was, you know, the work I've had the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to do in regards to cannabis
history has been just as fulfilling for
[SPEAKER_09]: sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's what a great thing to get you
all inspired for the cannabis historian
[SPEAKER_09]: role.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chasing waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chasing waves, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very Zen experience, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surfing is like one of the most Zen things
out there, you know, and it's up there
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're out on a good day of like say
a place like Jordan River, a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: point break over on Vancouver Island and
you get like a quarter mile ride on like a
[SPEAKER_03]: six to eight foot wave and that's right up
there with the hottest sex you ever had,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a pretty, you know, and if you
like, you know, get slotted in a barrel or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, that's just like this
timeless, timeless moment of everything is
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of stand still and you're in this
perfect cylinder of water, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just like something that sticks with
you, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, it would be so good if we could
experience something like that today after
[SPEAKER_09]: a nice session like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be like just be surfing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Endless waves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, who knows, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the sublimator now.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is his newer unit, the V.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I always get the name wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: It dabs up on top here and then herb
inside.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to hit it, you can haul ass
on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like toke right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can, you can haul ass on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different from most vaporizers in the
sense where you will, I know you said
[SPEAKER_09]: sometimes it's a little bit too much,
so I'll just pull back.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to pull.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what you got there is what I'd call
kind of the king's hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: A real nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus it's a sweet stuff, so it's not
really a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the difference between the
sublimator and other vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it hitting so much harder?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can only use the word, the metaphorical
words to pass this on to you, but I will
[SPEAKER_09]: say that what he's doing with this unit,
the way, and this is the key right here,
[SPEAKER_09]: these two touching, because it's not about
the wand.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the atomizer, this piece here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What this does is it creates an entire
space.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a particular temperature and you
put your herb in and then you pull it
[SPEAKER_09]: through this tiny little hole.
[SPEAKER_09]: A venturi, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: What it does is it basically accesses
magic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea how to say it any other way
than that, but if you are a smoker and you
[SPEAKER_09]: just test this thing against any other
unit, no other vaporizer is
[SPEAKER_09]: hitting like this thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about if you want the full rip,
the half rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on how hard you pull and how
long you leave the wand inside the
[SPEAKER_09]: atomizer for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely love the idea of a sublimator
bar where you have dab attendance taking
[SPEAKER_09]: care of the unit for you and just serving
you hits, because that's definitely where
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the taste and the smell of that is
absolutely sublime.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice little narrow leaf cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of the new theory,
the wide leaf and the narrow leaf drug
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's still like sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativas are thin leaf and indicas are wide
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say that the indicas, they kind of
came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the Hindu Kush kind of meet up with
the Tian Shan Mountains there in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the marijuana that they found
in central China that really well
[SPEAKER_03]: preserves stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still got the sativa-like leaves,
but then it's got some indica-like
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably right when they're starting
to hybridize it enough for the indicas to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce or something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if we'll ever be able to tell for
sure, regardless of anyone's theory,
[SPEAKER_09]: through genomic and through the mapping of
the actual genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that things like Acapulco Gold and
Colombian and Mexican Red Hair,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that those are just European
hemp varieties that got brought over and
[SPEAKER_03]: got adapted to the warmer climate and
started producing more resin and became
[SPEAKER_03]: those types of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole idea that hemp doesn't have to
contain any THC or anything, that's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: modern hybridization.
[SPEAKER_03]: These industrial strands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better with a little bit of resin and
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works as a bug repellent and stuff like
that and grows healthier.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to be a pretty important
component, at least for the plant that's
[SPEAKER_09]: followed us around for the majority of our
history.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems that THC seems to be a pretty
important component.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the earliest users, they were
probably just growing one big cultivated
[SPEAKER_03]: crop in a buffalo, utilizing everything
off of the plant, the seeds and the stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a cultivated crop, Carl Sagan believed
that that was likely humanity's first
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivated crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The root word for cannabis, canna,
that's like Proto-Indo-European language.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the oldest type of words that we
can trace back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the very beginnings of language
and stuff like that, as far as we can
[SPEAKER_03]: trace it back, there's references to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Current archeological evidence for
production of hemp fibers, tools that are
[SPEAKER_03]: used for breaking the fibers off the stock
of cannabis, tools like these were still
[SPEAKER_03]: in use just a few hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found ones dating back to about
28,000 BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's even older.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some evidence of stuff even older.
[SPEAKER_03]: The archeological evidence is just as far
back as we could date it through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been tens of thousands of
years before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like Dr. Jeffrey Guy and John
McPartland, Dr. Jeffrey Guy is the head of
[SPEAKER_03]: GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're speculating that cannabis itself,
the resins and the drug effects of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, may have played a facilitatory
role in the very important period known as
[SPEAKER_03]: the Great Leap Forward, when we really
start moving away from being animals
[SPEAKER_03]: living in the jungle to more civilized
beings and tool making and all that type
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That somehow the cannabis high and the
novel way of thinking that it produced
[SPEAKER_03]: facilitated that step forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got to think about just with
those dates, the history of us growing
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant beside where we live and in our
villages and growing in our human waste
[SPEAKER_03]: because night soil, before we weren't
pumping all of our human waste out into
[SPEAKER_03]: the oceans and polluting our earth,
there was a time where it was part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle of life in that we were like bear
shitting in the woods going back into
[SPEAKER_03]: nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: We utilized it into our own fields and our
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That energy of that going through us,
that put some of us back in that dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our relationship with this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a co-evolutionary relationship
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we have this really incredible
endocannabinoid system that matches up
[SPEAKER_03]: with the cannabinoids in cannabis and
other aspects of cannabis as well like
[SPEAKER_03]: gamelan laic acid, which is in the human
mother's milk along with endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in just a couple of other rare seed
oils and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we have this inherent
relationship, connection with this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's curing us of a lot of
these diseases that people are treating
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're now being referred to as
endocannabinoid deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how close we are with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe these are all starting to result
from our separation from this herb that's
[SPEAKER_03]: been part of our life on earth going back
thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a fascinating history it is too,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's completely fascinating and it's
pretty heavy when you get down to thinking
[SPEAKER_09]: about each one of those components and how
they line up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The co-evolutionary aspect of us with
cannabis, the Dr. Jeffrey Guy's theories
[SPEAKER_09]: of the Great Leap Forward being sparked by
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no big secret that the more we learn
about cannabis and its role in our lives
[SPEAKER_09]: that you can just see that a lot of this
agenda that seems to be behind making
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis illegal is simultaneously
creating different industries that could
[SPEAKER_09]: only exist with cannabis being illegal.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no need to replace the
endocannabinoid system's food,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you will, the phytocannabinoids and the
essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no real need to replace those if
you let people have them in the first
[SPEAKER_09]: place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you remove phytocannabinoids from the
person's diet, then they become deficient,
[SPEAKER_09]: then they have all these different
problems, and then they give you pills
[SPEAKER_09]: which are signalers for your cells to tell
your cell, oh, you're having a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's their version and it's never as
good as ... It's never natural.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's never natural.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because natural is unpatentable.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to be able to patent a specific
use and they, I can't believe,
[SPEAKER_09]: have any of a deeper understanding or at
least a deep enough understanding of
[SPEAKER_09]: what's truly at work here because I don't
believe we even have an understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like by prohibiting it,
they've made it also into this super
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful force of cultural change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like the classic Garden of
Eden myth and God says, don't eat of that
[SPEAKER_03]: tree of life or on that day you'll surely
die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they eat of it and their eyes
become open and they start to see all the
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy bullshit going on out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, it's pretty heavy indeed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're both proponents of cannabis,
as you guys can see, and after a nice
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis session and a tea and sitting
around and discussing cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_09]: history of cannabis, I like to unwind and
go for a longboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's skate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boosted, hey?
[SPEAKER_09]: Electrified.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you got your little remote control?
[SPEAKER_09]: Remote control, Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rechargeable little remote control,
rechargeable board, gets about a seven
[SPEAKER_03]: mile radius with about 22 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four different settings from beginner to
expert, you know, and great brakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your remote?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the remote there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just pull on here, ups forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: This way is reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, show us, let's roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Electric skateboards for the wind.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, yeah, these are super cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really loving this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're charging the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how you charge the batteries,
eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bring that break down a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy to control, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Backwards, and I'm breaking down a steep
hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I even just take the brake off a little
bit, we will go crankety.
Well,
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta say, this is pretty cool,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_08]: We head all the way down Ontario?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the seawall?
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I'm getting up next to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, but I'll let you lead the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn fine way to get around the city,
I'll sure say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm probably going about 20, 25 clicks
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently maximum this thing goes is
about 22 miles per hour, which is
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely like over 30 kilometers an
hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy was laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: How could you not laugh?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would laugh myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You stop at every stop sign just like any
vehicle would.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rolls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you roll up through with cars,
or you just go through your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, this is real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Real nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really nice, hitting down that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: No brakes needed there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I gotta say, this is pretty damn
cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: These skateboards are definitely a keeper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt was smart to grab one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kidding me right now, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: These are awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are smiling, I'll tell you,
when they see these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are always asking, where'd you get
that, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They get asked all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's like a total business in
Vancouver for these things, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chill.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get to rip this back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sea Wall, a Vancouver favorite right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Electric skateboard for the win.
[SPEAKER_07]: Following Chris Bennett through the city
of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I likes it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I likes it a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing is too cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unbelievable way to... Got it,
got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Chris just showed us the water,
and the water means we pick up our boards.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not worth the trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep your feet out of them and boom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my horse.
[SPEAKER_09]: BC Stadium right up in front of us here.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little tour of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm following your lead.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is definitely new to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the kind of skate... Oh, it's
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feels really good to carve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, really fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice layback, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick, I'll film you if you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is so good, Chris.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're living a good life, bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to walk past this,
eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy enough to pick up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay out of the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Bubble Man on his very first
day on this thing, which he's really
[SPEAKER_01]: rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's surfed or skated or
snowboarded, they're awesome on these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they just pick it up right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't even skated or surfed in like 15
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Loving this shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Electric.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those bumps really throw you for a
little spin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your commute, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you got a good commute right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going left?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going left.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, people would be renting the shit out
of these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you'd insure it by getting them to
sign a waiver saying that you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: insuring it and that they have to pay a
deposit.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much is the board worth?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, these are great, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the character.
[SPEAKER_04]: Electric.
[SPEAKER_08]: People really trip out on these things,
I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rubber necking and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much easier than a bike.
[SPEAKER_08]: All you do is stand on it and use this
little controller to just forward motion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't believe how great this thing is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris is getting going good now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shredding up hills now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still going probably a solid 20K,
which is 5K faster than we're supposed to
[SPEAKER_09]: be going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming up to English Bay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, this is killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps getting better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're killing me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should get one, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone should.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're going into Stanley Park or
what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go recharge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I could do this all day long,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll have that full ride back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that was so fucking awesome,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pound it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming to work amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are in the new cannabis culture
spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is Chris's shop, the Urban
Shaman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Location number two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks good, bro.
Clark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clark, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ride a longboard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ride a longboard?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't ride a longboard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unbelievably fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot believe how fucking awesome that
was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ripping through the city, seawall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every single person looking at Chris,
one time after another, rubber chicken in
[SPEAKER_09]: their necks.
[SPEAKER_09]: To look back and be like, what the fuck
was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes the smallest amount of noise,
but it carves up hills.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very impressed, Chris.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got me sold.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.
