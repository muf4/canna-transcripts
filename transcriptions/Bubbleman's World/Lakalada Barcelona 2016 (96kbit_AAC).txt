[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just got to Barcelona,
Spain here with Lorenzo and Tony from Blue
[SPEAKER_02]: River and we are heading to Calada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Calada?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at Calada.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going man?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good, very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do realize that you either have to
change the name or start paying Big
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling it the Jackie Emmental.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 8 grams or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: 80?
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: From 2 kilos of Malacca.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's 0.4 percent, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.4.
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.4 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Less than 1 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense for the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense for the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing this for many,
many, many, many, many years and I never
[SPEAKER_04]: got more than about 1 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I get 0.1 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it didn't matter to me because I had
hundreds of kilos of Calada.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's insane bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing he showed us when we sat down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This, what you just showed us,
it's as nice of a thing as you could have
[SPEAKER_02]: shown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one, that one is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bump, bump the bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was a 0.4 percent yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean this is for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that one, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he gave this one to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy some of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just bumped into a really cool
chocolate guy that just came into the room
[SPEAKER_02]: making handcrafted medical chocolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 milligrams per 100 gram chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pretty stoked on Spain so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have different products but so we
decided to bring that one because the
[SPEAKER_05]: stronger ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people eat them and they're like...
And also we have candy, moon candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so 75 milligrams for 50 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a little bit about on camera
how you started to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the story of this brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's a joint inventor between Italian
guy and Polish guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we decided to create this brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_05]: He provides for us Oompa Loompa and Willy
Wonka.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put together with the design and also
the card packaging and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we try to improve the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: 75 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is almost a gram right here,
this little guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pure milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is no healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that, magic milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: The concept is healthy chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we now create also a new line with CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would like to also create a bigger
line but really, really healthy with
[SPEAKER_05]: inside only pure products.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the idea is also select
different kind of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the dark chocolate was made with... The
first one is Ivory Coast, from Ivory
[SPEAKER_05]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 72 one is from Ivory Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one is the 58 is from
Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the other one, the white one and the
milk one is a good selection of nice
[SPEAKER_05]: chocolate with different good products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to create a nice line with also
good product inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to put the best medicine that we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to gobble it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it popular?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for the moment it's not very popular
because we tried to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before we want to taste the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony's gone a bit solvent-less these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubble man brand got into his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still taste it as strong as when you
hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now lick your lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harder, stronger, faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him the Jackie cheese bubble man
turf rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackie cheese bubble man turf rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is such a cool concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen this in fancy restaurants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot cream?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cannabis seed cream with a
cellulose of blue ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cream of mascarpone with nuts and
isolator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cracker is made with sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the sugared leaf too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you turn it a little bit so I can see
the leaf?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has no...
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not from cow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fresh cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's fresh cream?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fresh cream with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it human cream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an infusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat has smaller globules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little seed shell over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how medicated is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be destroyed?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hemp strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys at La Colada know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started with full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they showed us five varieties of full
melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: One from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they brought in the medicated
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they came on with this amazing epic
chocolate ball thing with the cream that
[SPEAKER_02]: melted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a non-smoke room.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a non-smoke room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs up for La Colada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Colada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go smoke the dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sweet high pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet high pie?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you forget, though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had one more little element.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filmed it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were supposed to fill the ball with
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a little stone of Pseudos of
bluish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he was going to blow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill the little ball with hash smoke so
when it opens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony got the dessert hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was supposed to be in the ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was supposed to be in the ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top notch, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so here's the hashes that have
been gifted to us so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me actually get that on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a water hash here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice greasy water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: One from Morocco, a local, and another
local.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty stoked on the flavors here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super kind of these guys to just have this
sort of thing set up as a little gift for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really nice landing here
yesterday and showing up at La Colada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like these guys are family already.
[SPEAKER_02]: All Italians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing little spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Barcelona, try to roll
through, especially if you're from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Italian community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to feel like you're with
family here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, La Colada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll show you a little bit of the place,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: These yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Thanks,
guys.
Thanks, La Colada.
