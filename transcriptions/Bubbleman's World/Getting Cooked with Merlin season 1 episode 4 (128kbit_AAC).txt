[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World
Episode 4 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a new friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to introduce our new friend
Merlin?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my buddy Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go from way back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been working in the cannabis space
alongside me and probably one of the true
[SPEAKER_04]: head reps out there that smokes more weed
than the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to keep the culture alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had dabs from a good friend of mine so
that was a good sign right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this beautiful little piece here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this piece by?
[SPEAKER_01]: JT Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Opalscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it from Drip Glass in Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deals from Drip Glass folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also made some Halloween gourd dab
rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Pickle Rick blender gourd dab
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you shaved the bottom off so
they're not going to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attention to detail is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul came over and we were going to get
the food and he's like, I'm going to make
[SPEAKER_04]: a dab rig out of a pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low and behold, they're sold out of
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went for the next option of butternut
squash and it gave us inspiration for one
[SPEAKER_04]: of our dishes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make a butternut squash
soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butternut squash soup is the first course
of today's meal and that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm down with maybe taking a little
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do this thing for like 15,
20 seconds and let it cool for 30 or 40?
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally do cold starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cold starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'll do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeps it nice and simple and that way you
can guarantee you're going to have a great
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally Marcus is the most prepared man
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today he forgot all of his equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened already twice now though out
of two times.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what they say.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend with me is a friend indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cold starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold start action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I like to heat up the part
that's away from where it's sitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a nice little crew in Calgary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're part of the Jamison's crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are doing some great work at
Big League.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bringing fire to the market and
that's what we need up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing great things in both
cannabis and the mushroom space right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely stoked to always pay
attention to what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Chris and Jordan and my phone
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold start smear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells pretty good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rosin world really opened things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, you know, before rosin,
all my friends that were of the persuasion
[SPEAKER_01]: of BHO, which I know you appreciate some
nice BHO, my friends that smoked BHO,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just never, we never had,
like they would smoke my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, I don't smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now what I find is, that most people
that have an appreciation for BHO will
[SPEAKER_01]: also have rosin in their stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about having a diverse offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pickle Rick blended.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I figured you probably blended the
soup too, didn't you?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be doing some double
blending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Merlin did a little bit of preparation
today because it would have been literally
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour more of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: To prepare what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we get into the kitchen,
he'll kind of go over a little
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction and what he's already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll make sure that when we give you
guys the recipe, if you want to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: recreate these dishes for your own selves
and families and friends, we'll get the
[SPEAKER_01]: recipes put up the best that we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try and put the best directions I can
on the recipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have any questions,
just hit it in the comments and we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: sure to answer you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the number one question is going
to be, do you do birthday parties?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Special appearance from Marcus and Merlin
to cook some food and smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a fun little lift session.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so far so good for episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see what we do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merlin's got his sights set.
[SPEAKER_01]: High in regards to the levels of
elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we announcing what we're going to do
yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so far we've been doing a lot of
comfort food and today we're going to kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of elevate it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do three courses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start with, uh,
with the butternut squash soup,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we're going to go to a beet
tartare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to finish with
scallops, cream corn, and a barbeque
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you that think you heard
beef tartare, he did say beet with a T as
[SPEAKER_01]: in the root vegetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beet tartare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time he told me we're
having beef tartare, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'll just skip that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he like served it up and I was
like, you were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that avocado bed?
[SPEAKER_04]: All the regular at our dinner table as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to get the homies together and
have dinners on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was saying earlier, I'm generally
kind of a picky eater, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: stick to heavy meat and potatoes,
but I will eat anything Merlin puts in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that'd just be silly not to on
your horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not as much of a picky eater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now as I've gotten older,
I'm pretty willing to try anything at
[SPEAKER_01]: least that's within the scope of my diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I don't really have a title for,
you know, I eat some fish, I eat some
[SPEAKER_01]: seafood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't generally, I don't eat birds and
red meats, but um, I was brought up a
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually they've been to your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully one day they can do an episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually coming out here in
December.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old hash guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad has worked on hash farms in the
seventies in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: This crazy stories before the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to tell us some stories while
you're cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just telling Paul about like,
my dad's old stories about a double zero
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred kilos for one kilo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the true double zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the true skunk man Sam
dry sip 99.9999% heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like 10 grams per kilo.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 grams per kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the fun begins.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a triple zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely the strongest product
I've ever consumed in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to hear people tell stories of
leaving his house cross-eyed and I'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, how high can you be?
[SPEAKER_01]: How high can you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tripped out pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I smoked his hash with a lot of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he kept just giving me bong wrap
after bong wrap after bong wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm certain that night he hit 50 or
60 bond rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certain I hit probably around 20 and
that was like a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember leaving there just being
like, trying to kind of get my way home
[SPEAKER_01]: from the area of Amsterdam that he lived
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bikes flying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just driving, trying to like not get my
tires stuck in a tram track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fall into the canal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Falling into the canal was never a
problem, but the tram tracks are deceiving
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you don't pay attention to them and
you, you don't cross them properly and you
[SPEAKER_01]: go like one's going the same way as you
and you go into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get ugly fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years did you live there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't live there for any years,
but I traveled there like 40 or 50 times
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of trips to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been twice, but both memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure I probably spent almost a
year in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to combine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had it up all my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a cool city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had the pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well one day soon here, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sure to all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world will open up again one day soon
and one can only hope and when it does,
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling will be a foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traveling is there, but just these vaccine
passports that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that's not really opening it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean once it's opened back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like it used to go back to like under
a medical emergency or a health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe even normal could be a bit
different because a lot of the systems
[SPEAKER_01]: we're currently operating on are like
faulty broken and just need replacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way Greta would say about the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, well, if the system is not
working, you replace the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to fix the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just replace it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to do some replacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what it's done for the workplace
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you shouldn't have to go to do a nine
to five job anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're, you know, unless you're
working a physical, physical labor job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the jobs that it was just taking
admissions for nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, think about these communities,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people spend an hour in hour out of
the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's two more hours of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or David.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's maybe think about getting into
the kitchen and start this little cooking
[SPEAKER_01]: video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merle just called Paul in to be the sous
chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I will be behind the camera,
giggling away and enjoying myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, uh, let's get to it.
Boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already done a little bit of prep
for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you just fill the pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Filled up the pepper mill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we use pepper and pretty much got to
get that beta carry off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a pot heating up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with the soup, put a little
bit of olive oil in there and wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you didn't see it, but on, on camera,
but earlier I made, uh, some butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nut with some curry with some cayenne
pepper with, uh, or not curry,
[SPEAKER_04]: sorry, with Cuban powder and, uh,
with a little bit of salt pepper,
[SPEAKER_04]: olive oil, garlic and ginger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then roast it all in the oven at 420
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 420 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's pretty much ready right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got a nice little crisp roast flavor
to the butternut squash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got the butternut squash and we got
the hot pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get the onions in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get a little bit of translucent,
get some flavors stuck to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_04]: the pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bit of salt and you can see in here,
they're kind of hidden because they kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of took on the color, but there's like
roasted garlic in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's roasted garlic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pieces of ginger in here and all that
flavor is like trapped inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once these are flavor trapper,
flavor trapper.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, speaking of flavor trapping,
my girl loves the mustache and it's also
[SPEAKER_04]: November, so, you know, we'll put a little
bit of support.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually had a few friends with
prostate cancer, so better off to support,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not look like a dirty porn star.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's fucking slick or like a plumber or
a cop or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you find it's better for the,
do you find it's better for sniffing
[SPEAKER_04]: turps?
[SPEAKER_04]: It can get stuck in there and you kind of
like, you know, air it out and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: get the right smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Paul, you want to start by
putting those into the blender right over
[SPEAKER_04]: there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the beats?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you want to stop it once or,
once or twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Move it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scrape the walls off so you can get a nice
consistent beat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather eat this than the beef tartar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just ground up the
[SPEAKER_01]: color of the sun shining through it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like so good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see there'll be a super vibrant
dish when it's all done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to stir the onions over there for
me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some onion stirring.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we have these ground up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we have these ground up,
we'll get them into this pot right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hit it with a little bit of
lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll give it a really nice shine if you
can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop it down a bit into the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes it a nice shine on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use all sorts of different oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it with pistachio oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: A pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is where the real flavor from
this part comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's with a few capers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really preparing food for all of
the senses, even beyond the palate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's nice to have different textures
and flavors that bind together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the dish better in the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you understand that, everything
flows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chop up your capers a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are those onions coming, Paul?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming along great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting nice and brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just reduce the heat a little bit on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get our capers in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get this to marinate a little
bit is why I'm getting this one done
[SPEAKER_04]: first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the capers in, and then this is the
part that really adds a little nice kick
[SPEAKER_04]: to it, is some horseradish.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little horseradish, a little Hass and
Feffa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get all that mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so close to having a sun shining in
it, but it's just not quite there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're right here if we can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The color is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth doing for, honestly,
because it was just in the shade and it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vibrant, so vibrant red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super vibrant, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that that's marinating, we'll just let
that sit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to try it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make sure that you're the taste
tester here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was after a flavor explosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we'll get these squashes up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All grilled up and mashed, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 15 to 20 minutes at 420 degrees
in the oven, and it gets nice and soft.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what did you put on there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you put ginger, you put garlic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whole ginger, whole garlic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put cumin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a little bit of cayenne pepper,
a little bit of olive oil, all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can see where it's going to get a
nice coating in the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a little bit of wine in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that body flavor really up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to burn it to the bottom almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stir that all up and grill
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just absorb, done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll get a little bit of veggie
stock in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to take the stuff with no salt so
that you can adjust it yourself after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we'll turn up the heat on here to get
it boiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: One little extra thing we'll add to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cooking with that, the squashes and
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bay leaf in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember to take the bay leaf out
before you blend it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're going to blend this,
I just want these flavors to sit together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure we mention that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely very, very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to eat sharp bay leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually when we make a bunch of courses
like we're about to do, we serve them one
[SPEAKER_04]: after another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, it's all going to be about timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soup's going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the next part we're going to do is
the bar glass sauce because it takes about
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 minutes to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little pot on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medium heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get some olive oil here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a bar glass sauce?
[SPEAKER_04]: A blah blah sauce?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bar blanc, which means white butter
sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like on fish a lot of the time,
you'll see a yellowish white sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really going to go well with the
sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're calling it bar blanc?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bar blanc.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a classic French sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to go really good with the corn
and with the scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just let that heat up a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: While that's happening, we'll make the
avocado mix here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're going to do, I cut up these
avocados already.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a little bit of lemon on them so
that it would preserve it and it stays the
[SPEAKER_04]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: You squeezed half a lemon onto them,
eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just preserves the acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It preserves it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept them from browning out completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just scrape that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green color.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go two full.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two full avocados here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For four people, I would suggest about two
full.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe put a little bit more lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The avocado has an amazing texture to the
dish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This time I'm going to go with a little
bit of dill extra in there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually people put cilantro, but I like
dill in a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the terpium on dill?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a nice variety of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so pungent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a little bit of that in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super simple for the avocado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simple is better with Mexican food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I consider this Mexican,
but this bottom part of the semiguac
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just mash it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a good mash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to add a little bit of fat in
there and put a little bit of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives it that nice shine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get it mashed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when we're going to put it into
the molds after, it'll just be easier to
[SPEAKER_04]: work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're not mashing it
completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still want big chunks, but I want it
mashed enough that it's emulsified.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let that just sit there for right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: While this is hot now, we'll get our
shallots in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have just a bit of oil in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just a little bit of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to add a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once these get a little translucent,
we're going to go with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: salt as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so everyone knows, if it looks like
I'm putting a lot of salt, it's kosher
[SPEAKER_04]: salt I'm always using.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot more granular, a little less
salty.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot easier to salt stuff with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little bit of salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sweat those onions out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or shallots, I should say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to get a little bit crazy
with this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put some white wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put some white wine
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want this to be super hot and get
some flavor stuck to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_04]: pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you throw in the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll really let these reduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finish it with some good butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: These shallots are getting nice and
translucent and super cooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see they're melting almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to hit it with a little
bit of white wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: About a quarter cup to a half a cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to boil out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping for a little more of a boil,
but I think it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're also going to put a little bit
of white wine vinegar in there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to let this boil out and
kind of reduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll add the rest of the
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those flavors are coming together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just turn it down and let it simmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end we put a little bit of coconut
milk and it really brings that creamy
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let this boil down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn this up a little bit
next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next is prep the corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be for the scallops that
we're going to do after.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite dish to cook?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to cook something new pretty much
every time I eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to always try new things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I like something, I'll make it again
and again until I perfect it and then kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of forget about it and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the journey, not the
destination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to always eat different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's like a decompression from a
super stressful work environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's what growing always was for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always walking the plants,
getting in there, training them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always very cathartic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: This corn has already been boiled.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty hard to find fresh corn in
this time of year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, this one's from,
I think it's from Mexico or southern US.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to have fresher corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it with canned corn as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not canned corn, frozen corn,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're ready to go with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to fry that into a pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I can put this in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say you're going to fry the corn
in a pan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to fry it in a pot and
cream it with a little bit of cream and a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of Parmesan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what I'm going to do here is turn
this one on in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where the butter comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also going to prep butter for our
barbonaise sauce, if you can look over
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting to reduce down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to need more of a thicker goop
with the shallots.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we want to be prepped for is to have
cold butter to add in there in increments.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a decent amount of butter in here,
so it's not for the faint heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think butter is good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should put a little rosin in there with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put a gram in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I ate about a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sleep great all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hash smoker, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash smokers don't not sleep great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a difference between a cannabis
smoker and a hash smoker for sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when I smoked cannabis,
it was different from when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking hash, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to cough and have phlegm in my
throat and cough up little things
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had that for 20 years of just
smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that was 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was only like 28.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking, I was like, I shouldn't be
coughing up phlegm and stuff, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking major joints, dude, like a couple
of zips worth of weed a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big three, four, five gram joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, the ceiling was no bueno for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you made a good decision on your own
to concentrate healthier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm addicted to just having a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you having your joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my friends, speaking of which,
some of my buddies call me the smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smoking chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always got a joint in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is getting pretty good here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can see, it's very, very syrupy
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to reduce the heat down on
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to add in a bit of cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get the heat way down because
you do not want to boil your cream,
[SPEAKER_04]: so take it off for a sec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your cream in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: About a third of a cup in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job not boiling it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stir that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll get this shot of like you
stirring the pot with the joint in your
[SPEAKER_01]: other hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be our thumbnail for this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Butter is going here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the butter, we're going to just wait a
little bit and get it a little bit brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a bar noisette.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of has a little extra flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll add to the corn and then we'll cream
it and we'll put some cream in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll still be a bit chunky too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you can see this is turning into a
nice medley right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add a little bit of salt to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want to keep this constantly
stirring and then as the heat is low,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to just stir in cold chunks of
butter bit at a time and it'll become like
[SPEAKER_04]: a bechamel kind of consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with our first one right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really just want to slowly melt it in
each chunk at a time, kind of whipping it
[SPEAKER_04]: in almost if you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Melting it and whipping it and adding air.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do this a few times until
this sauce thickens up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll just put it on the side and
wait for our scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cube number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of us actually, I guess we all
eat fairly healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Paul did have the record this
summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen anything quite like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We spent a lot of time on the road
together this summer visiting dispensaries
[SPEAKER_04]: across this great country and we had a
blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bumped into each other twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: In different provinces.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ate some pretty good food but Paul ate
how many 72 pizzas?
[SPEAKER_03]: About that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I touched about 72 different pizzas across
the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: In one road trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was having like pizza anxiety like I
need to get pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long was your trip?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 65 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: 73 different cities and we had 421 stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can imagine in the 70s of pizza,
that means you had pizza almost every
[SPEAKER_04]: single day of your trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking it was like a two week trip
and this motherfucker was eating like six
[SPEAKER_01]: or seven, eight pizzas, 10 pizzas a day or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes in the next butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Whoa, how many pizzas did he
eat?
[SPEAKER_04]: You see it kind of thickening up and
getting kind of shiny on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, we don't want to forget
seeing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to get a little bit of a
hazelnut color into the butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're building flavor on the bottom too.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, we're going to so-called
that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This soup is coming along quite nice as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting very thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: One meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a three course all at
once, which is hard to do usually,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think I can time it right for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's anybody that can, it's Matt
Merlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't wear white shirts when
I cook anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had good clothes on last week and I
cooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just melted butter everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable turmeric pancakes,
gluten free, wheat free.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was with rice flour, corn flour and
turmeric.
[SPEAKER_04]: And coconut milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes these crazy pancakes that
Ben, I can't even pronounce it,
[SPEAKER_04]: B-A-N-X-O.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Vietnamese dish and I had all these
chives.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I finished the dinner and I had
nice clothes on and my girl was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you ruined all of your clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did ruin all my clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless her soul for taking care of her.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had turmeric everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pretty much ruined everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting nice and browned here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to hit it with our corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: That nice browned butter, it's going to
need a lot of flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now just to pick up the juices on the
corn, you will add a bit of, oh wait,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the wrong broth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to add some vegetable
broth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have some left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of broths around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's collecting broth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love cooking vegetarian food,
but during the week I do cook meat as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: In very good moderation though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to eat it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was brought up a vegetarian,
so I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to add a little bit of
vegetable stock here and kind of clear off
[SPEAKER_04]: all that stuff that's on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a little bit of liquidity to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep that heat moderately low because
we're going to put a little bit of cream
[SPEAKER_04]: in there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cream and the corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Creamed corn, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to hit it with a bit of
salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going to let that simmer a little bit
while it heats, and then we'll just hit it
[SPEAKER_04]: with the emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be able to do the soup at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, how's our bar of line coming?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it's starting to thicken up on
us a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we add butter a bit at a time,
this sauce is going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard not to be with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the shallots, the vinegar,
and the wine really give a nice acidity to
[SPEAKER_04]: it as well, so it makes it cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to just have a few little dots
on the side of it with the scallop and
[SPEAKER_04]: with the corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're all going to really meld
together as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Emulsification to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to go too much because we
still want those beautiful kernels of the
[SPEAKER_04]: corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nicer if you can get it deeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: This shot should be in 3D.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's flipping everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't notice on the camera,
there is stuff going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a nice thickness here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get one more stick of butter in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more stick of butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it cools, it gets really thick
because of all the butter as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to strain out those shallots.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be a nice sauce, a little cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great with the scallops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what they say, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A stick of butter keeps the doctor away,
no?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that's what it is,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a Quebec motto.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to not forget our bay leaves
before we emulsify this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the bay leaves out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not poisonous or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but they're super brutal texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't make you digest them very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bay leaves chunks in your meals are back
at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing is thickening up pretty good
for the barbona sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's strain out the shallots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have our little sauce here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, filtering it right through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not joking about how smooth that
silky that sauce is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it cools just a little bit,
it's going to get really thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if I have a little bit of truffle
oil in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use a spoon sometimes to mash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell it is drier than you think,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gravity does most of it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little volute sauce there, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put my joint out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it's getting a nice
consistency there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a little taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Lion's Bay water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Lion's Bay water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresh from the mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right off the mountain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we'll emulsify this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might want to get more
[SPEAKER_04]: puree at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you roast the garlic and you roast
the ginger together, it really works well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to turn that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a pretty good consistency here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it looks amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to add a little bit of
coconut milk to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this brand, Arroy D.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you know in the future what we'll
have to do is we'll have to get our guests
[SPEAKER_01]: and the sous chefs short training seminar
before we film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's all sorts of things you
could be doing for you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the timing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You only know when you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that whole cannon goes in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to get extremely creamy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just diluted the color so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the color of spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or fall, I should say.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color of fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Butternut squash is like a very fall time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of our favorites at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never had one before.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've never had a butternut squash soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't eat much vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most things you cook, I had not eaten
it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put butter in the soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thick it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it just makes it a nice silkiness,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it gets a nice shine to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what this can use?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truffle oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of the soup that we talked
about last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a tiny little bit of herb spicy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say a little bit of salt as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can really taste the ginger in the
soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Season it all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to grab a spoon there,
Paul, for her?
[SPEAKER_04]: Give Marcus a try.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to try it too, Paul?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab another spoon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that is on point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that is delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't really do that much placing
besides the initial one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if he spiced it slightly different,
it would be a doll.
It tastes like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A butternut doll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokes, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too far off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the lentils could be a good
addition to the soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some of these sautons in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a little salt, slice them on an
angle, put a little bit of olive oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit of salt, a little bit of
pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to put them in the oven at
our favorite number, 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: In they go.
[SPEAKER_04]: While that happens, I think that this is
ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the pan hot for the scallops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get the pan hot for the scallops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you don't fuck up the risotto.
[SPEAKER_04]: No risotto this time, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that's heating.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to prep the scallops at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'll show you guys how to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find where I put them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're up to the left,
above your tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And above the tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so it's really important to
prep your scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows this, but there's a little
membrane around a scallop, like a little
[SPEAKER_04]: muscle that you have to take off when you
get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that little muscle is super chewy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I wonder if that muscle in that
little creature ever thought there would
[SPEAKER_01]: be a group of beings that would classify
that muscle as chewy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a real existential crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If only scallops evolved to have more of
that muscle, maybe humans would leave them
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuck alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they have it, sometimes they
don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily on this nice beauty one,
we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So OK, here's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can see right here, there's an
extra muscle that you can see that's
[SPEAKER_04]: attached here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you kind of just peel that guy right
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have your scallop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one's good, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's good, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to put them on a nice dry
towel, because you want them padded dry
[SPEAKER_04]: for the technique that we're going to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like I'm peeling off the
eye on a ribeye.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that last one has one too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, before I realized this, every time I
made scallops, and especially when you
[SPEAKER_04]: make a ceviche or something, and when you
make a ceviche, you know that chewy part
[SPEAKER_04]: of a scallop ceviche that everyone is
like, ugh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wash my hands again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a favor here, and we'll drain out
the beet mix that we had here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've kind of let it sit together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, there's a lot of juice
left in the bottom of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll spill out all over the plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I like to do is grab a little
strainer, and then just put all that beet
[SPEAKER_04]: in there, and then press it down so that
we can get all the liquid out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll build our plates for our beet tartar
dish.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to grab a little mold here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like to do it with a round mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, you've got your little mold there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to start with the
avocado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of push it down to the bottom there,
and really nice distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to grab our beet mix here,
Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going a little too crazy over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this stuff already strained,
is what that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to go too hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get a little bit of the
juice out, so it didn't go all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't sure what kind of pressure you
wanted at the plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: No stress, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here now we're going to add some beet
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm pretty baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely would hit a rip before we
eat this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Paul, you want to know what my
favorite sous chefs do?
[SPEAKER_04]: His line up dabs while I'm cooking is the
best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gourd dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gourd dabs it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so now that one's ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to slide this off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we give it a quick wash here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy Christ, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it right in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't have had it in a better place
to share with everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reveal was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_04]: While these are making these, I'm going to
have a rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, look at that mustache.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Halloween, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to roast a few pine nuts
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this is always tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to burn those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roasting pine nuts and burning them to a
crisp is a fine line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very fine line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I learned this week,
though, is that a dry roast is much easier
[SPEAKER_04]: to handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to have no oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to dry roast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a cool pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a cool pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put it at a low heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to take very long,
but it'll be just gravy, and they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to burn before that nutty flavor
kind of comes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll just finish these up real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that just looks so nice with the sun
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm blocking the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had about a month of rain,
and it's nice to have a few days of sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two colors are a banger just alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you add the textures and the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a triple threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Paul, would you mind checking on the
crouton?
[SPEAKER_04]: Croutons in the oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard, and then it pulls out nice and
straight there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number three.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want to make sure when you do it
with the beets that you push it down
[SPEAKER_04]: really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, well, not really hard,
but like with a bit of pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way the mold comes out nice and easy
and you don't get beets all over your
plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see you tapping the edges,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to really push that down,
make a nice flat surface on the inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you messed it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, now we got our three dishes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pulled out the croutons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pulled out the croutons.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're nice and brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can just let these rest a little
bit while we get the rest of the meal
[SPEAKER_04]: ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are going to smell a little bit the
pine nutty flavor coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting a little browned on the
edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're dry roasting, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dry roasting, a little pine nut
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes, you know, you really get the
flavor out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get them out of here before burning
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put oil, they'll burn before you
get the flavor out.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we got a little preparation going on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little behind the scenes B-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may make it into the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old B-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set up the table outside since it's so
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, how about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give them a little shot of the
glacier across the way.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter is here from the mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get my drone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have done a drone video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did let everyone know that the drone is
going to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The battery's ordered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the top of Anvil Island that we're
looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Squamish the other day,
and there's faces that you can ride right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Whistler has like three meters of
snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Squamish the other day too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see if we have enough
time to do another quick little dab-a-roo
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching Merlin get a dab made me want to
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little cold start dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best dabber for dropping cold
starts in, but I didn't bring any of my
[SPEAKER_01]: gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm blessed to have access to what I
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it a cold start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three perfect low temp dabs right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, perfect dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ready for some perfect meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you guys have both been in the
background of this little clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to clean this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all nice set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well I'll come set up the
camera over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get in the banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the tripod here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably have to go get my other battery
cause this one looks like it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nuts are roasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry roast, nice brown color on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how am I going to set this camera up?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to finish the cook first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our pine nuts cooling over next
to our tartar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the next step here is get our pan
super hot for the scallops, which is the
[SPEAKER_04]: final part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of our dish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prepped plates are made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're getting to good heat here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to add a little bit of
grapeseed oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of these, not too, too much,
but just to coat it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a sec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a little out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to get the coat there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're getting hot there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get our scallops that we prepped
earlier that are super nice from the
[SPEAKER_04]: market down the road here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a nice padded dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of paper towel on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way we get a really good sear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of round them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we've got this high temp here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you put them down, this is the
most crucial part for the good sear is you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to get them down and really place
them and push them down firm so that it
[SPEAKER_04]: gets a nice crust on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to be the widest side down first.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for me, I know that my pan is hottest
over here, so I concentrate mine right now
[SPEAKER_04]: with a gas grill.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really feel that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same hot spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine there's hot spots on the gas
grill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's where a good pan comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even then there's still a hot spot in
that pan for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely cast iron is the way to help on
that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let those things fry out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the whole key to this thing is you
want this first sear at the high heat with
[SPEAKER_04]: the oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once those are seared, when you flip
them, you essentially want to start
[SPEAKER_04]: hitting it with butter and basting it as
you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I think about it just sort of a
little bit better, we're going to add
[SPEAKER_04]: garlic into the bottom of that pan as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make it super tasty butter
that's going on top of garlic out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll keep those sitting on the side right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our cubes of butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these you can tell underneath it's
starting to get a pretty good browning
[SPEAKER_04]: sear on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get some tongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Paul, while we do that, you want to
just help out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can grab those three bowls right over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Place them all in, all three of them,
and place it in so you don't splash it
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you were going to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I wonder if he'll pass on his
level of chef OCD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does make all the difference in the
world if you drop a drop on the side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: You eat with your eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just what you want it to look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we get a nice sear on all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see they kind of stick in place
when you flip them back over.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when we hit our garlic down in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start hitting it with a bit of butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really a lot less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a little bit of flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we want to just tilt your pan up like
this as they're frying and just literally
[SPEAKER_04]: spoon butter, garlicky butter all over
those scallops for them to finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now get that garlic right up in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really want to do this at very high
heats so that it really gets that good
[SPEAKER_04]: sear.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go down, you can get a little
more heat going back to it, and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: can pull it back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to do this too long,
about two minutes aside probably at the
[SPEAKER_04]: moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see all that lactose foaming up,
but it smells so garlicky good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the butter pretty much bases and cooks
the scallop itself, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are getting pretty close to ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to let those rest for two
seconds in that pan and let them finish
[SPEAKER_04]: off while I grab something to hold them in
while we wait to plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want a little bit of paper towel to
hold that off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our nice Bar Blanc sauce that is
really kind of reduced down and super
[SPEAKER_04]: nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, we will set up plating
over here as well for our scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three plating areas, if you guys can see
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going crazy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's going to be plating time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start with our, we'll start with
the scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul's wonderfully done our soups over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't mess up at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start with the corn for
the, for the scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll put a little dollop on each one
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to make little piles first to kind
of measure exactly how much corn we have
[SPEAKER_04]: each.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be nice and generous on the
corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that like burnt butter or
browned butter, I should say, color of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just give her a quick little
swipe down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make two nice little dollops there on
the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when it comes in handy to be baked
to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of take your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got our scallops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that looks spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in that butter, white butter sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really has thickened up as a cool
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then get a little bit of parsley on
there as well over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put parsley on all of our
soups.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got a little more left here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to throw it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's finish our, let's finish these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a little bit of pine nut, roasted pine
nuts on the top of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to grab a little bit
of these alfalfa sprouts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just build a tiny little nest there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiny little nest there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we'll grab a little bit of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is infused with garlic.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of this 12 year old vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 year old vinegar, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not very much left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still getting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just for a little touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just add some toasts to here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're scooping it up.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finely baked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finely baked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to put this up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's set up the chairs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goodness, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, this is so ridiculously
gnarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know where to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should start by announcing what each
dish is and then we'll just gobble it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got pans here at Scallops with a bar
blat and a creamed corn with a bar and
[SPEAKER_04]: lozette.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have our butternut squash
roasted soup with garlic and ginger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then our beet tartare with roasted pine
nuts, avocado, and some sprouts and
[SPEAKER_04]: vinegar and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just absurd and ridiculous on all
levels, but why don't we take a bite of
[SPEAKER_01]: each kind of thing here and as we do,
we'll let you know what we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you know what we're going to
think, but oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fell apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scallops just fell apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trick is to get a bit of the corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That bar blat is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is really quite
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the sweet with the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the sweet with the corn and the
scallops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The texture of the corn is nice too
because everything else is so buttery
[SPEAKER_01]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contrast plays really well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need teeth for these scallops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about crushed the whole thing.
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a bite of each thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try a little bit of each thing
before we turn off the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have crushed that like nonstop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to put it away right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soup is just delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even like the way the aftertaste of that
plays with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of works so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the creaminess of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture of it is absolutely silky.
[SPEAKER_04]: The odd little chunk up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scallops, ginger, garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is such a sweet looking dish as well
as clearly being delicious with the 12
[SPEAKER_01]: year vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again,
[SPEAKER_03]: that contrasted texture is just
impeccable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be a really good theme working
through today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two thumbs up from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you give it six stars?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely give it six stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 90 micron full melt meal right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the full melt clear dome right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try going that zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purely excellence achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way for people who have a
hard time with avocado.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get past it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a different dish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: With the horseradish gives it a little
pungent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like a spring dish for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the capers to give it that salty kind
of prime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, knocked it out of the park once
again, Merlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you pulled a caper on my taste
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Paul, it's a super pleasure having
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was an absolute honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say with the amount of time and energy
that Merlin put into this, we owe it to
[SPEAKER_01]: him now to focus our attentions on this
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recipe will be in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crash mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fine there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crash mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
