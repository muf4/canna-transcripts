[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Journal Club,
where we review and interpret United
[SPEAKER_01]: States cannabis patents and scientific
journals with concise overviews of complex
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific literature in an understandable
and easy to consume manner to expose the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge hidden in the scientific
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not claim any medical utility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We advise you to obtain your own copies of
these public documents and share them with
[SPEAKER_01]: your doctors and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to talk about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about cannabis
as a new classification of antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is Cannabis Journal Club,
and I'm Dr. David Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a retired cardiovascular and thoracic
surgeon, and I'm board certified in
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac surgery and general surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm self-taught in the cannabis
science, the endocannabis cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we have a cannabis epiphany or a
cannabis revelation that cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are a new class or
classification of antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I say that is because
cannabis cannabinoids kill bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses by really unknown mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all antibiotics are classified by the
mechanism of action of how they kill
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all kill bacteria by one
mechanism, not multiple mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, penicillin kills
bacteria by disrupting the cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, which protects the bacteria and
it allows the bacteria to die because the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall is not protecting the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three main mechanisms of
bactericidal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one is disrupting the cell
wall membrane or cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is disrupting RNA
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third major mechanism is
disrupting DNA synthesis of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So membrane disruption, just to start with
number one, such as CBD and CBG are
[SPEAKER_01]: lipophilic and they interact with bacteria
cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually insert into the lipid
bilayer, increasing membrane permeability,
[SPEAKER_01]: disrupting membrane integrity and causing
leakage of cellular contents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you explain that a little bit to
the viewers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bacteria are really batteries and
they maintain themselves by moving
[SPEAKER_00]: positive and negative charges in and out
of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you disrupt this mechanism of
maintaining the proper charges inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the bacteria, it causes the
bacteria to absorb things it doesn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, maintaining cell wall
integrity is important to prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria from absorbing too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put a bacteria in plain water
with no salt in it, hypotonic solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens is the water will go into the
bacteria cell and cause the bacteria to
[SPEAKER_00]: explode because it has too much water in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maintaining cell wall integrity is
important for bacterial survival because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are really little batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you discharge the battery,
then it kills the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually that's why salt kills a lot
of bacteria because it disrupts this
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of maintaining the proper amount
of water inside the bacterial because all
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanisms inside the bacteria,
they need a certain concentration of water
[SPEAKER_00]: and salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you disrupt that, they don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by disrupting this mechanism,
you disrupt all the cellular functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is particularly effective against
gram positive bacteria, correct,
[SPEAKER_01]: as their single layer cell walls is more
susceptible than the double layered gram
[SPEAKER_01]: negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact mechanism of why cannabinoids
kill bacteria is not fully delineated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently cannabinoids kill bacteria
by multiple mechanisms, not just a single
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism like antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that fact in itself, the fact that
cannabinoids kill bacteria by an unrelated
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism to the other classes of
bactericidal antibiotics means that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are a new classification of
antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what the drug war doesn't
want you to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this cannabis kills bacteria by an
unrelated mechanism of action that kills
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is exactly like the discovery of
penicillin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when they first discovered
penicillin, they knew it killed bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't know the mechanism of
action and they had to wait for science to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up to delineate that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the drug war doesn't want doctors and
scientists to know this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it kills bacteria by an unrelated
mechanism of action to the other classes
[SPEAKER_00]: of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to your physician about this and
they will look at you with a surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: look on their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you know something that they have not
been taught in medical school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interference with cellular processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids may disrupt bacterial
metabolism and replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, CBD has been shown to inhibit
DNA and RNA synthesis in some bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, impairing cell division and
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also affect efflux pumps,
reducing a bacterium's ability to expel
[SPEAKER_01]: antibiotics, thus enhancing antibiotic
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really mind-blowing statements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, we're making this new
discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have obviously known about this,
but just seem to want to bury it and not
[SPEAKER_01]: expand upon it because it would seemingly
be so helpful in the medical field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if this was to be proven,
and it will be proven at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would go against the Control Substance
Act, which clearly states that there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: medical utility for cannabis in the United
States and not safe under doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to prove that cannabis is a
new classification of antibiotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would mean that the CSA schedule one
classification is a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inappropriate to say cannabis has no
medical utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the drug war doesn't want this
knowledge out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we've got our key examples of
CBD highly effective against the... Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: geez, I couldn't even pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staphylococcus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Staphylococcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staphylococcus aureus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then CBG shows potent activity against
MRSA, which is of course by targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: cytoplasmic membranes and inhibiting cell
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: MRSA is one that really travels around
prisons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an infection that is popular in
prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's resistant to a lot of different
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I also wrote an article, CBD in the
treatment of Ebola, because CBD is proven
[SPEAKER_00]: in medical literature to stop cytokine
storm and subsequent disseminated
[SPEAKER_00]: intravascular coagulation or DIC and
microvascular clotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote an article about CBD in the
treatment of Ebola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new evidence has come out since this
article was printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And University of Washington has proven
that CBD inhibits COVID viral entry into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell because it blocks what's called
the ACE2 receptors, acetyl coenzyme A
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the COVID virus uses the ACE2
receptors to gain entry into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Washington study also proved that CBD
decreases the amount of viral protein
[SPEAKER_00]: production by 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Washington study proves that CBD is
useful in the prevention and the treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of Ebola infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabinoids have a wide variety of
antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal
[SPEAKER_00]: properties that have not been delineated
as yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since they don't teach this in medical
school, it may be quite a while longer
[SPEAKER_00]: until this evidence appears in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, you can check out
Cannabis Journal Club with Dr. David Allen
[SPEAKER_01]: and Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will make sure to bring this
information to the light every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next week on Cannabis
Journal Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ciao for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ja ova evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always live it.
