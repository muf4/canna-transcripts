[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with D420K in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy to have you up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like multiple seasons since I
saw this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not on a Facebook or a Skype type.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was last winter.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was last winter, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spring and now into the July month of
summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just rode up on your Harley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Must have been a bit of an epic adventure
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's at least 10 plus hours away to give
you an idea if he beelines it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know he didn't beeline it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not with the long way, because it's better
when you're riding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're definitely going to do a
little bit of that today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've brought some of your world famous
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the fresh frozen that it stuck to
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, does that stuff reek.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is just incredible, that fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was powder.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just beautiful sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like a little ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll photograph it for you guys so you can
see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nugget.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that nice cushy smell to it as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG?
[SPEAKER_04]: OG, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG, tried and true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is that full mount clear dome that
we all know D420K so well for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hand presses, finger presses just
instantly into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to taking a big old
dab with the Bubble Man's World's
[SPEAKER_04]: audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a treat.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not messing around with small dabs
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going big.
[SPEAKER_04]: As usual.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Darren's around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big dabs will follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, you put the little cheese plate with
the berries and the fruit on the table
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to have a snack when we're in
between puffs, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cleanse the palate.
[SPEAKER_11]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give the nail a little bit of a
cleansing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, the melt factor on that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just boils, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fine, fine amount of residue,
which of course will be when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with hash and not oil,
we're always going to be left over with
[SPEAKER_04]: that tiny little bit of wax membrane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be alarmed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it smoke off and then just blow it off
the nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something you need to be feeling
that you have to inhale.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first part of the hit, that first 90%
is just so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I love doing the most.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got all sorts of nice treats in the
house, eh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, this is what I gave you there
and this is some stuff that's cured up
[SPEAKER_11]: since the last time you were up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's been curing since then.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the glass jar too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's waited out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's done that thing, but you showed me
the method there when you're in video was
[SPEAKER_11]: there on how to get it gooey again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty straightforward and works well.
[SPEAKER_11]: For myself, if I'm dabbing it like that,
I like to have that consistency.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sure is interesting how the resin can
pull moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when it's left open for any
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially coming down here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It still presses up nice though.
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff is new.
[SPEAKER_11]: I made this last week.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just sifting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was sifting literally about two hours
before we left on the trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: My bro Chance from Iron Heads,
he came down and picked me up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was sifting about two hours before that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just finishing up, putting that stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to definitely send you back
with some new screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the 250 micron and the 180 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm very excited for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quick little trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a real quick trick with the 250 to
the 180.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can throw your material over it very
gently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lift up the two screens and you should
have a very clean, high percentage of
[SPEAKER_04]: gland heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing compared to how much Darren's
making on a regular basis using carding
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to hearing about what he
comes up with with the two extra screen
[SPEAKER_11]: sizes and how he starts playing with them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I got here is two different screen
sizes.
[SPEAKER_11]: One's the 70 micron or 73.
[SPEAKER_11]: One's the 107.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the 107.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the 107 a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've even got it on the 120.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've even got heads off of that and
they're so fat.
[SPEAKER_11]: You look at them under the microscope and
you take a toke of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely interesting how you can
separate the different profiles and the
[SPEAKER_04]: different effects via just the size of the
glandular trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mixed both the grades just because I'm a
bit of a pig that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a nice big fat dab there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be able to talk for 15 minutes while
he's hitting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're basically going to do a few
different things today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to take you guys for a little bit
of a sea to sky highway motorcycle ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the GoPros mounted on the
Harleys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get out on the boat and take
you guys out on the house sound a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just float around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe bring the D-nail or a pure hash
joint and chill out for 15 or 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: with you guys out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we will also potentially go into the
city today and maybe we'll see if Megahill
[SPEAKER_04]: is open.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, we'll find another spot where we
can go potentially have a session down at
[SPEAKER_04]: the CCHQ or one of the dispensaries.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a full day planned with you guys
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're definitely going to do a whack of
cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super looking forward to getting on
the Harley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even tell you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been on it for three days now steady.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I probably was on mine was
probably with you driving around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big time ready to ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that don't know,
my Harley, I have a very different
[SPEAKER_04]: connection to the bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: My father, of course, he passed away on
the bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had purchased it for him for his 50th
birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time he was 55, him and his wife
hit a deer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going quite fast on the highway
and all that were involved, parents,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I fixed up the bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of how I visit with my dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been thinking about him quite as
much lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been nine years since his passing as
well as his wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be another day for me to sort of
visit with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an awesome way to connect for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're cruising around, you know that
I'm in my head talking to my dad and his
[SPEAKER_04]: wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful day for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're surrounded by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Jamaican seedling that's seven
and a half weeks old.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lamb's breath?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bread of the lamb, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bread of the lamb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have John's Mehdi Kush,
John Berfalo, sharing his medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rimo, the urban grower, has shared his
medicine of course as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then this is the first cut from the
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already rooted and happily growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you can see that it's missing a
top.
[SPEAKER_04]: That top is in my cloner and it's rooted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have a clone from the seedling
cloned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to start sharing the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_11]: See what it looks like when it's in full
bud.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It could freeze your face or something,
you were telling me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it totally numbed out my mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years ago?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in 1995, so 19 and a half years
ago, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: January, February, March, April,
May, June, July.
[SPEAKER_04]: Substantially, about 19.2 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: In that process, how did you store your
seed?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it in a special container?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it in a freezer, in a fridge?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it just in a drawer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, all of the above, none of the last.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took care of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that keeping it cold was essential.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the longest time, it was just in a
sealed plastic casing and then inside a
[SPEAKER_04]: little container inside the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: After probably several years of being in
the fridge, maybe upwards of five to
[SPEAKER_04]: seven, I put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I remember being like, I wasn't sure
if the freezer... You don't want the
[SPEAKER_04]: freezer to get too cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have it crystallize the embryo,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had it in a freezer that was
basically turned substantially down,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it still produced ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was still... No problem,
these rips are intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, for most of its 20 years,
it was in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a third of it, it was in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I dare say there was probably a year
or two that it was just at room
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, which is incredible because
the last seed I brought back from Jamaica
[SPEAKER_04]: at room temperature in this warm weather,
cracked in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically cracked before I put it
in paper towels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one's now growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost three inches tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wanted to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got all sorts of life blooming
forward from these Jamaican trips.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, of course, just got back from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there with John and some other
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were working on some projects there
that we'll hopefully be able to talk to if
[SPEAKER_04]: they pan out and if the future allows us
to do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm back to Jamaica in 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad I caught you while you were
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing this trip before we get married,
me and my honey.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next month, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing a trip with my bro Chance and his
wife.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And having a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they done trips before?
[SPEAKER_11]: Chance and his wife?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is his first trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not his.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's his wife's first trip on a long trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's done a few hour trips.
[SPEAKER_11]: You kind of got to give him props for that
because it's really not easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, she went from Dawson Creek to Prince
George, first leg of the trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about four or five hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we went from Prince George all the
way to Kamloops.
[SPEAKER_11]: We arrived at Kamloops at like 1230 at
night.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she didn't complain for a second about
anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: She just trooped through.
[SPEAKER_11]: We pulled over, put some sweatshirts and
some leathers on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty top notch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to give her credit.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a genuine official biker's lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you, doing those five
hour tours, I've driven across Canada and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just like, it's like 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_11]: She slugged right through it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And five hours at a time on a bike is
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you get into any sort of
weather changes and wicked rain or
[SPEAKER_04]: something, you can make five hours just
seem like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: Props to you, Jess.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm definitely ready to put a couple
hours out on that bike myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where you want to head out,
but we should definitely figure out which
[SPEAKER_04]: direction we're going to go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can come back later and do the sunset
out on the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could call Mark, the weed guy,
see if Mega Hill's open today and see if
[SPEAKER_04]: we can't get down there for a medicated
pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be a good idea for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got a ton of shit that we're
going to do here, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're coming along with us, so we're
going to have a few more puffs here
[SPEAKER_04]: surrounded in these beautiful cannabis
plants on this just epic bluebird British
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bringing you with us, so stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the voice of my soul.
So, let's make sure we don't have to be in
a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have?
[SPEAKER_09]: She was killed at the age of 23.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, killed in the highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super beautiful girl and dynamic human
being.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, this is her spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever want to stop on the highway,
she's got a bench.
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic fucking view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck, dude, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a sick little ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice little rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're here at the Shannon Archer
Memorial.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen me stop here before,
have a puff on the bench that she's got
[SPEAKER_04]: back there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful spot, memory of a beautiful
girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a really nice spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: No tragic bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff has to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know about water or do you want to
hit this dry?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do it dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do it dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do a dry rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: On our next stop, we'll hit the...
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll fill the cooler up with waters and
ice so we can have water for next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very often that the focus isn't
100% THC, but when you get Darren and I on
[SPEAKER_04]: our bikes, THC just takes a back seat to
getting onto the highway.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this highway was built for riding,
and our bikes were built for this highway.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, we're supposed to hit this
highway no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's a pretty beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I grabbed some dry sift off my desk
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to...
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the heating upage of the... Well,
you know, I'm never sure on how long I
[SPEAKER_04]: heat this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just heat it up till it kind of turns a
little orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, make sure you can kind of... It
is a bit tricky outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say hold it good and close like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of on that one side away from the...
You know, like right where you're hitting
[SPEAKER_04]: it on that other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect, right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of hold it up against the side
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it gets nice and hot, we'll dab this
little dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is the Pacific Ocean behind us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen me out there the other day on
my boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got killer whales, Pacific seals,
Pacific white-sided dolphins, sea lions,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, giant octopuses.
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pacific Ocean is definitely stocked
with epic ocean mammals and fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty smooth for a dry hit, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: These little Hitman baby cakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that dry sip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that in the bike all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll turn you into a gob of goo,
a gooey goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in the sun right now, it's starting
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so... We're not sure exactly
how far we're heading up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll stop at Shannon Falls and check out
the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll maybe stop it in Squamish and check
out the new gondola.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll go past Squamish and go check
out Alice Lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which side did you heat up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've taken our rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to relax here and enjoy the
view till we feel the full feelings of our
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine wearing off so we're safe to
drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get back on those bikes and
rip up towards Whistler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the epic stops if you're
heading from Vancouver to Whistler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shannon Falls is generally a spot to stop
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of our taller waterfalls even
here in Canada, aside from maybe Niagara
[SPEAKER_04]: Falls, which is epically huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's beautiful here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The creek starts right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally right behind us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little creek.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's feeding out from up in
behind those trees up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a serious motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we're just going to walk up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, D?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to go have a session at the
base of that thing or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should drink the water when we get
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and fill the pipe up with water more
importantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've stood under the falls.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's summertime now, so the falls
won't be falling quite as they won't be
[SPEAKER_04]: quite as raging as they normally are in
the winter, but definitely it will still
[SPEAKER_04]: be a humbling experience to stand
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is all new, a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can do the trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can walk in the trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the fall right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to bring my honey here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a good spot to bring the
girls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely brought my wife here many
a times.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should be my wife at it next month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is also the beginning of the
Stalwimus Chief.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you notice that giant rock of granite
as we rolled in around the corner,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a huge chunk of granite.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's called the Chief and that's a
pretty epic trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say we head in this way.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some boulder hoppers, some rock
hoppers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is all coming from the waterfall
feeding out and going right down and
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have to climb up through the
falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to put the GoPro on for that
footage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I could probably hold this
camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: You good, Dee?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little bit cougar-like on these
rocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very cat-like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cat-like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome, hey?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one of the many super fucking cool
places that you can check out in Shannon
[SPEAKER_07]: Falls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic sized trees and rocks that have
collided and collapsed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dee's over there climbing up a tree like a
maniac.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got himself into a zone there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: You going to go around that way?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see if I can meet up with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll meet up with you up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll meet up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Careful of that rock, it'll be slippery.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is gnarly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super gnarly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Here too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Dee.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely come around this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: You end up on top of this giant boulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some kick-ass climbing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the real fucking deal,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't done this in a decade or more,
Darren.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't able to have the camera on that
one, but we just came around this corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it was sketchy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did it on our stomachs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dee's up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says we're getting to the waterfall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's fucking do it, Dee.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tenacity of the hash smoker shall
prevail.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to head up, smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say glaucoma?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had to get him the cannabis drops.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been some years since I've been here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking A.D.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I can feel it in my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bottom of Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super powerful place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Len's going to get covered up with water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very misty here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dee made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking kick-ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're driving Harleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're floating in boats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're visiting epic nature sites like
Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to get my suit off and
go stand over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: These rocks are going to be slippery as
fuck, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powerful shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: What a beautiful spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Haven't done this in years, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: For whatever reason, today we inspired it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Touch and go, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We just trucked up here hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might take us back the far away,
which is a creek.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll just take us down without any
of this gnarly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: We probably won't be able to have the
toque right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we can go have it right there or down
in here around the corner, literally on
[SPEAKER_09]: that flat rock over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took off my waterproof phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was just like wet a little bit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I went there too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where you stand.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where I've stood before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've ever stood anywhere
different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've only done it a handful of times
in my life, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Un-fucking-believable, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just showing me your shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to change the camera around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I might have fucked my camera up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful British Columbia with Shannon
Falls behind me and the Pacific Ocean with
[SPEAKER_03]: the mainland, Sunshine Coast, Squamish up
this way, the Big Chief, and just epic 30
[SPEAKER_09]: to 40 foot fall on either side.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some seriously dangerous hiking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because Darren and I like to stay safe
while we hike, we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: bubble hash session.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready, Darren?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right,
[SPEAKER_07]: guys, Darren and I just soaked under
Shannon Falls.
[SPEAKER_07]: We stood under there and let the power of
the waterfall smash us down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Powerful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're fine here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good hike up, walk the rock off in and
stuff I haven't done in 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then standing under that waterfall
right there on that rock.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we figured we'd take a little rip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should put some water in the bowl
now that we're going to need so much
[SPEAKER_07]: water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do it real quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I'll hold on to the tools.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you a little bit about our trip,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're going to be heading to a
place next and grab something to eat,
[SPEAKER_12]: some of the fine food in Squamish or
Whistler or somewhere our bike trip ends
[SPEAKER_12]: up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've driven by this place probably a dozen
times, but never stopped here.
[SPEAKER_12]: What a treat.
[SPEAKER_12]: If any of you ever go by this place,
if I go by this place again and I'm with
[SPEAKER_12]: friends or not, I'm stopping in no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_12]: What a place.
[SPEAKER_12]: The beauty and the energy of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then to have some nice dry stiff,
full melt, just killer OG dry stiff hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: What better way to top it off?
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't think of anything better.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder how Bubble Man's doing with the
water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, look at that, here it comes back.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a good climber, this guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: He knows what to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: You made it, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a little water in the baby cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not so sure-footed in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we've got that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to grab that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to view up the dab first.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: How fucking awesome is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: The beautiful British Columbia allows you
to cruise around, enjoy her parks and her
[SPEAKER_07]: waterfalls and her lakes and her creeks
and her rivers and her oceans,
[SPEAKER_07]: her mountains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we jumped the gun on having a hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be empty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks too bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're out of fuel.
[SPEAKER_08]: We came all the way up to have a rip,
but we're not having a rip because we left
[SPEAKER_07]: the red torch, which was a little bit
bigger, down on the bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we save this, we carry it down,
and we have a rip with the bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I found some trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still having a fucking hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right up here at the falls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do this up, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice and light, but nice and tasty.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Babylonians want to arrest me,
but tell them ganja's not a habit,
[SPEAKER_06]: it is necessary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much ganja man and jildap,
we're going to set them free.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're smoking, smoking, it shouldn't
cause no bother ganja to the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, when we're smoking, smoking,
shouldn't cause no bother healing to the
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we are the designated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it or not, it's in a paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a link up, but we call that a filter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, oh, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't cause no bother ganja to the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, when we're smoking, smoking,
shouldn't cause no bother ganja to the
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, yeah, fish and chips.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just went to the Sushi Sen,
killer sushi place here in Squamish,
[SPEAKER_04]: and got denied.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't open for a fucking hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we waiting an hour?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got the Wigan Pier here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is old school, one of my favorite
fish and chips place in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't tell you how many times on my way
home from Whistler I've hit the Wigan
[SPEAKER_04]: Pier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they're always open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go have some Wigan Pier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanna just go in or keep going out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go right into the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cooler inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do the video.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're filming for the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, this is going to be on
Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ninja doubt, though?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should go have a puff down on Pepe
Gringo's.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, where do you want to sit right down on
this bench in the shade over here?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to run over to my bike
and get the butane, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Darren and Bubble Man D420K.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're stealth dabbing in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the Squam.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see over there you've got the
diamond head up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some other surrounding mountains over
this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wigan Pier with D420K hitting it hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not very stealth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're medicating.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting its right grab now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to take the first rip?
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one's yours, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice rip on this beautiful afternoon
so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a nice session at the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've ripped up on the motorcycles,
stopped at the Shannon Archer Memorial.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stopped at Shannon Falls, climbed up to
the base of the falls, and let the
[SPEAKER_04]: waterfall smash down on our shoulders.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was humbling shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still wet from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we came to Sushi Sen, which is right
across the street from us here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're an awesome sushi place locally in
Squamish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally denied.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't opening for an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hit the Wigan Pier, one of my
favorite fish and chip places to hit on
[SPEAKER_04]: the way back from Whistler.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was ready to go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delicious, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_11]: You liked your fish?
[SPEAKER_11]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: You betcha.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had nine to 15-ounce pieces of cod.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I had, cod and fish and
chips.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking deadly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm eating this for dessert, for a treat.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have to do another rip,
though, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one did the job, but another one
will be even better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All these two is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't fly on one wing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need two wings, so let's wing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's wing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got a call from Phil from True
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's at my house right now cutting mother
clones off of my mother's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Told him to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also brought me some strains,
apparently the Ortega and some other
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not exactly sure, but we're going to
head back there right after a couple more
[SPEAKER_04]: rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to bump into Phil and see what
he's saying and maybe do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic talking and puffing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you're good?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hitting this and across the street
is like a woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got her dog on a leash.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got her young son with her.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even look.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost becoming more of a normal
thing to just see a couple of dudes
[SPEAKER_04]: dabbing on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Digging it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because them greedy Babylon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready, buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cars everywhere, bikes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: How we doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's let that bad boy cool down for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, we're going to jump on the
bikes here in about a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be right back with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the GoPro for the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to keep this day going,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the ganja more and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the ganja more and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I rise this morning.
I've got to have me some ganja.
But I see the new day dawn.
More light and split for the ganja.
Everyone got their own thing doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But me, I've got to have some sentimental.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the ganja more and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the ganja more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each and every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come plant your seed and give it water to
let them grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the hills of Mendocino,
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiskers in my hand, I trim my weed and
don't mess with coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I mix my ganja, butter in the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wash some pomegranate choppers,
fly over my crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I light my back with blood right on the
mountaintop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Asha, I say pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say good ganja, man.
I'm not fooling around.
Good things are made the way we sow and
reap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we pass the ganja on the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say the ganja, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep a hustle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say hustle from afar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Babylon, you want come stop, mister.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom, keep high.

[SPEAKER_01]: We got the highest grade from outdoor to
the indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out my seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: TGA genetics rooted when I sprout my seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cooking rattlesnake and living in the
redwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till up the soil and then we feed organic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja farmers, mentors of the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sending it to the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pulling it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me ganja pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say Mr. Asha, when me light it.
Man, I'm not fooling around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm not smoking, no baming,

[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm in a Mendocino town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say pass it to me neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say neighbor, pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grown in the backyard.

[SPEAKER_06]: Love the ganja more and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day.
Love the ganja more and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day.

[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't no clown.
I
[SPEAKER_04]: ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
I ain't no clown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no clown Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to come home and see you up on the
deck surrounded by all my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess we're about to do a little
bit of that sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that get a little upset,
have a little minor aneurysm when you see
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm sharing strains that you feel I
don't have the rights to share,
[SPEAKER_04]: you should turn off the video right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't want to see this is what I'm
saying if you get upset when I share
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics because we're about to kick down
a good dozen strains, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely are, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: A dozen strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got we got some strains from Johnny
B here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some strains from the Doc Atomic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some from the Great Gardener,
some of my own that I've collected and
[SPEAKER_04]: planted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to get yourself a pair of
scissors tossed over from the sidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little pair of those little Katie
scissors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good toss.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got right off the start,
we got what do you got the Afghan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one is, of course, from the House
of the Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very reminiscent to me of the old school
Romulan that Romulan Joe used to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the first things that I've
seen in a long time that had that smell
[SPEAKER_04]: and that taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy goes going large.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to go large.
[SPEAKER_04]: Woody, Doc Atomic said the same thing when
he was here the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then many people said, no,
that's not true, which is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But cannabis is the dichotomous plant
where you just have so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: One guy says one thing and it's like,
no, it's the other guy swears against that
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're so resilient.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll do these two opposite things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people are like, no, I'm doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, dude, you're both doing it
right and simultaneously both doing it
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Barb is right next to you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first two that he picked Afghani and
Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the great gardener is happy to
share his genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, most people are that are selling
them because they sell the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether you're sharing them or not,
people are able to buy them and acquire
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both of these two, the Barb and the
Afghani, are purchasable in seed form via
[SPEAKER_04]: the Vancouver Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we should be probably hitting bowls
while he's doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Dan?
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't want to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be rude, but I was just about to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm about to crack into your hash,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the November.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last November, and this was the day before
I left.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, five days ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I let it set up for a good month on
the screens before I sifted it all out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one's
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Barb?
[SPEAKER_04]: Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Barb, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in the fucking car, Barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to fucking go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little treasure chest as you
pull one out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Haas number 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: His Hayes OG skunk cross.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should take a break for a
second and have one of these.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Darren, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dig yourself out a nice toe for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just clean the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try her out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we can't have dirty dabbers going
into the clean hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's your little blocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are cute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concentrate.
Hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Haas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you get some nice little clones
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a tough looking plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very barky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, this one was so loose.
[SPEAKER_04]: At first, I remember it being just like,
it was so weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a tall stalk and then it had this
like mass just right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like kind of falling over and
loose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, man, I don't know
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes OG skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And John was just like, you should
probably just hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of his OG crosses have been great so
far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's hard to hit something with OG
and not come out with something pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've yet to see a terrible OG cross.
[SPEAKER_11]: That OG is always such a treat.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: It gives good quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of strains when you cross it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've got that headband for you as well
that I collected up at Weed MD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not Weed MD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was from... Those boys in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a patient that was sealed up and
they used it for cluster headaches or
[SPEAKER_04]: migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they're patients consuming a
half ounce a day to keep his cluster
[SPEAKER_02]: migraine today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you got to do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hoss it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same way, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also have, once we get you these
eight, because you're taking a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: each from the four that are here,
I've got some more in the cloner and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: go check out that afterwards and see if we
can't grab you a couple of clones out of
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me assume with a 107 screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little 107.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between this guy digging for hash,
between this guy cutting for stash.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got my custom D-nail in front of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just tore up the Cedar Sky Highway with
my buddy on the Harleys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went and climbed to the base of Shannon
Falls and let the waterfall smash down on
[SPEAKER_04]: our shoulders and humble us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quite good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very good day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we might do the sunset out on
the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still could happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful day here in British
Columbia, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice big, tall clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got all eight already?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had only four.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Hoss and another Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your Afghani is over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe with the Hoss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A-F-G-E-N-I.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's the torch in the case?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to clean something up or?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know I wanted to give our friend a
taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, dude, the D-nail can pass off
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a huge long whip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Already?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pass on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Off-camera action.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll use some of this cured up stuff for
a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try that first.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to pass him this, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass him so much shit that he has to
literally be like, how the fuck am I
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to grab all this with two hands?
[SPEAKER_04]: The fucker's giving me a bone with a nail
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's going to pass it back right
after.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's professional, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: He handled it just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our secret guest off-camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll never tell you who he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to tell you it's a he.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a she.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a fucking hermaphrodite for
all you.
[SPEAKER_10]: No offense.
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, you want to exchange?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've already taken the haus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to bring it up here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you want to leave it down there?
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's gearing up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's only got a couple of left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're both OG ROM crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any of that stuff finished
from Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, all the OG crosses have been
killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, it pukes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That haus, as well, is a reeker.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant right there is one of the
stinkiest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Afghani, as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might as well try one of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, because the sweet skunk,
the Congo, they don't stink quite as much
[SPEAKER_04]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have a good reek.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a good nose on them, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anything Afganica, I found in my
opinion, man, like the OGs, like the sweat
[SPEAKER_02]: band, anything like that just stinks in
veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the sweat band Katagiri still stinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to drop that one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I smell that astral boy burning
again or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just starts.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take a hit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is that your?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you guys finish doing this,
taking these clones, you've got two more
[SPEAKER_04]: clones to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you said in all the years he's been
friends with you, that's the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's had a chance to sample resin
that you did yourself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's never really thought about that
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to go back over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nothing that you from start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: For eight quick cuts, four strains,
boom, bam, boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just gave you OG crossed with ROM.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just gave you the Haas number 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you remember that number 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you got the Barb and you got the
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next up, I'll take you over to the Era
Cloner, Power Cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: A plethora of strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: A plethora.
[SPEAKER_11]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got a little bit more for you over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can show me what you brought
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, lovely.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to pop a few more bowls here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just finished taking these cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably get these into the cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the cooler's right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go through real quick?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go through it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that while we're hitting bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got yours right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are nice and secure in the shade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely wouldn't want to take cuts this
fresh and put them in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would harsh out and droop over.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't mean you couldn't bring them
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stress them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stresses them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stresses me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I see them, I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stressing me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet skunks all like laying on their
side.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plant can have a stress-free start.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got all sorts of fun things
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it stress-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make you happy and stress-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an OG that I selected through Bag
Seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a story behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some of the best OG that I've ever
seen, reminiscent of what Dee sifts with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some fucking flame OG, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're the only person that I've given
it to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Secure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have something to put it in?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want me to hold on to those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Flame OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flame on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just get that lined up nicely.
All
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So flame OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Ortega.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ortega.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really old school seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you collect these seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not allowed to tell the person or my
relationship with them, but they're an
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was something that they acquired
and had for years, even before I was even
[SPEAKER_02]: of age.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Ortega.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like a strain that we used to
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ortega is actually the Ortega crossed with
Cinderella 99, which is smacked with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Apollo 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the Astro Boy, which is right behind
us here, right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy as that, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Family.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a family friend gave me those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: He saved them for a bit and then gave them
to me quite recently, a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just expecting me to keep them as a
gift, a sentiment, and they germinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite, quite awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice when a breeder brings you
something that they themselves didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: breed, but it's like an old stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, here, you should appreciate
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Ortega.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on, shit is wicked strong,
produces trippy crazy resin and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: narcotic in its high.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the Ortega well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have smoked a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you got something, some more of
your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is some work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is TruGenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys produced this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that, again,
this is an extremely complex hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was MedMan Silver, Silver Skunk Cross
to Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected a very skunky, blue cheesy,
gross smelling phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit that with my sweat band F1 male and
came out with the sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that sound attractive?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells stinky.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like jam, toe jam, stinky, like blue
cheese.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Toe jams.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, come on, this is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Riding for three days, no change in your
sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel pretty sweet about that right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also, in the tent, we gave you a Sour
Berry Cross Sweat Band, which we call
[SPEAKER_02]: Berry Macduff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really big glaucoma hitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Berry Macduff is in the tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sweat Band F1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweat Band F1.
[SPEAKER_04]: The strain that you use to produce the
sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Berry Macduff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Berry Macduff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Berry Macduff is... Sweat Band and Sour
Berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that bag that's sitting in my
freezer that we never washed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So busy that I can't even afford,
I can't afford time to go wash the resin
[SPEAKER_04]: with my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty pathetic, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: We tried twice.
[SPEAKER_13]: We definitely tried twice.
[SPEAKER_13]: With a broken hand, I even went over to
your room with my lizard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get these into the cloner here
real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's six right here that need to go
into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got, in the cloner right now,
that you're going to be able to gain
[SPEAKER_04]: access to quite a few strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are rooted, some are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to hit a bowl of the Astro
Boy, because you haven't hit any of my
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh frozen yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to go dump these into
my cloner, pull some more out for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got in there, just to name a few,
Medi Kush, my Jamaican, the East Coast
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour Diesel, Hash Plant, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's endless when you start sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, wow, what happened if
you're in scarcity?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I started with two and now I have
like 28.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called love and abundance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, shit is like peanut brittle.
[SPEAKER_11]: I teach that to my grandkids all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you teach your kids and your
grandkids, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I go to the room, they hand me a car
or they hand me a train, one of the toys,
[SPEAKER_11]: because they want to share with me and
have fun too.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's, you know, you teach them at a
young age and it works out to the end,
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people just never got people you
can't share.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't like to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back up there with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the peanutty brittle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dessert ash, pure dessert ash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dessert ash.
Sizzle.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can hear that sizzle from on the cat
in my bed.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no way you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just boils oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: And silence and a clear dome for like a
substantial amount of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then you get this rip that he's
about to get followed by the, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe the taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on my lips.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in my throat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Took the words out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right from the top of your head,
right down like a fucking blanket.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste the parentage in there so
much, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even if you're smoking OG out of that
next, you still taste an Astro boy after
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking OG, which to me, I've never smoked
anything that dominated over that because
[SPEAKER_11]: it's such a strong taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, he's like the Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, this was found in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the sizzle is more from the fact that
there's moisture still in it, but do you
[SPEAKER_04]: see it melt?
[SPEAKER_04]: We found it accidentally under my fridge
door yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: My son was opening and closing it and
pushing all this food into the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got under there and I was,
I pulled these two pieces out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, he thought he was in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, thanks Tosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, thanks bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taster's choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give a rip to our friend
off camera and we're going to go meet you
[SPEAKER_04]: in the office where we'll show you the
cuts that he brought and we will give them
[SPEAKER_04]: the new ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in my office.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at the power cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the strains that you gave me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get them into here and then
we've got four more empty vials for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the, you need these vials and
these vials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So did you grab that marker?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So probably won't even need that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just, uh, let's say the first ones
we're grabbing are Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The loms bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finding anything that's pretty
non-existent these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: True story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I've been after,
I actually asked you about the loms bread
[SPEAKER_02]: sometime during our winter sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just said it's really, really hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have some, but it's really,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely forgot that you had the beans
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you said that it's just basically
hard to find non-existent DA spraying in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll hear from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like sweet skunk?
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like Congo?
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I, I didn't grab sweet outside,
did I?
[SPEAKER_10]: So sweet outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll go sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a great strain to give away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch your back.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're sitting in front of the camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a real nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going right to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, here we've got some water right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, we don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, uh, released all this water.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go grab some cause it's
important we get some.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a sweet skunk and those other
three.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will fill them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both Jamaicans.
[SPEAKER_10]: How excited are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't given these Jamaicans to anyone
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the first to receive them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably the someone who wants it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the most, but wants it really bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad that I can just give it to you,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Without any weirdness, without any.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I know man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really happy that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we know that it's going to reading
work, patients, medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to get hoarded by us
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you brought me.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG or Tega sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say, look at that ceiling
already.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that Jesus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just growing out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the Jamaican that I just cracked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The little one, the little one.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know this has this and look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now so rooted down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got sweet skunk and Jamaican
though that we're going to give you right
[SPEAKER_04]: off the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, sweet skunk and Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet skunks right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Roots are just starting to numb out on
that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to cut it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put the scissors, slice them in there
sideways and time a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a nice step.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like these roots are going to go right
away.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, another sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here we'll give you this nice little
one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a root.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that for a pull?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to cut that open a little bit
with the scissors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those small cuttings got really big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these are nice little stalks and I
don't want to damage the.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jamaican, I know there's some roots on
these Jamaicans, so I'll try to cut them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I give you ones that don't have roots
because they don't go through very nice on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and actually have another.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are Jamaican too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have some of these as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we'll just won't have luck
pushing the Jamaicans through here with
[SPEAKER_10]: roots on them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've taken these as such big cuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to stress them out any more
than they need to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jamaican,
[SPEAKER_10]: darn you.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's four.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go ahead and plop the clones that
I gave you because they have tags right on
[SPEAKER_02]: the cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we're going to do these.
[SPEAKER_10]: These can go right in here as you are
correct because they have tags right on
[SPEAKER_10]: the cuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: How professional is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're running a large license breeding
facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even need this much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to cut these down quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did it in half a second.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gave you lots to work with.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's plenty to work with for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very good.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll give this guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least an inch and a half to two inches
below.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put this leaf out a little.
All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was the OG.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the OG.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's another one for you, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Strip it a little bit on the way out.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's outay.
[SPEAKER_10]: She is outay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really walked through the mother
room last night and it's basically like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumanji jungle in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to figure out what you would like
to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what I got to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: All this seems like a real nice surprise.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never talked to you about any of this so
I wasn't really expecting a big slurry of
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it seems as though since I've been
giving them away, I have to admit they are
[SPEAKER_04]: coming more readily like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just because people want, but people
seem genuinely to want to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be a medical breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just go against everything that
I'm about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I started breeding in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to just cure my own disease and
illness, was to spread it out to other
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done exactly that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely the righteous thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the righteous thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that was Ortega,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ortega, we did what, two OGs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OG, OG, Ortega, Ortega.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get them in there pretty good,
bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gots to admit, you do, you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: These will be much longer than they
normally do.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pretty big and woody.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay though.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put them in the otter reader like
that, they'll just, they'll grow to a half
[SPEAKER_02]: a foot in the otter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed that myself with my cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the aeroponics is really,
really... It's quite efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to deny it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can try.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just hard to flush if you're fully
completing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the other two?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I only take out two for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Two sweet skunks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, two and two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put those four in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to make room for two more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is it next?
[SPEAKER_04]: We give you the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congolese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congolese, coming right up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congo, Congo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a couple Congo.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's starting to root.
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting to seem to root.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're all good.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all healthy and good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to take a couple of the Congos?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have, what are you writing on
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Congo right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Congo.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got two Congos?
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit loose, not too loose,
but a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, another Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real deal Congo for any of you out
there watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be that real deal Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever that means.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the thing we know is the Congo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be growing it out and I'll
assure you when it's flowered.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my source was quite good, so I
wouldn't be too concerned with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let me find you a couple that don't
have roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you want a bigger one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much, Flath, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a bigger one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went after that one for a minute too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll give you this bigger one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like 10 years of me searching for
genetics and they're all in one person's
[SPEAKER_02]: balcony.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If only this was easy 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, you know, there's your East
Coast Sour Diesel one.
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast Sour Diesel two.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right,
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast Sour Diesel two.
[SPEAKER_04]: That gives me a few more sites to work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just gave you four.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see, I can put your sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that for a string?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sock, sweat.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: The female weather was, it looked like
skunk number one and just blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheesy, cheesy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rotten, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like roadkill skunk with a little bit of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just super gross.
[SPEAKER_10]: The docks I know there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Super gross in the greatest way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, in the best way possible only.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can get your docks on now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't gotten that to you yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just doing the sock sweat.
[SPEAKER_10]: One more for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just really thought you'd enjoy
everything about that string.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sock sweat?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the resin is phenomenal,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks great.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, better cut these down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just makes life so much easier in the hair
cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see people all the time, listen,
listen, listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you should.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have the room, if you don't,
if you have the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many reasons why you should.
[SPEAKER_10]: But exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many reasons why you should.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't affect the plant in a negative
way.
[SPEAKER_10]: It turns it down and gives it room.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it prefers to have that room over the
big healthy fan leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two sock sweats are in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm secure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's two more that we're going
to cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Knock out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a jammy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is going to have roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're so lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two that are like all rooted up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The roots are going to get damaged
sticking them in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this will be somewhat sensitive.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll probably droop over.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see roots starting in this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back down to the head.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll probably be a little droopy,
but it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because it's been a while since we
turned the cloner off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the clones are starting to hopefully
that will secure there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any water in there at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make room right now,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have these lovely Max T's of
plant to cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got, I've got, I can take three
to four of those right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Take away a roll.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the video being so dark guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just such a bright day out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought we'd close the back here and
maybe be able to get some decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that one has some really cool deformities.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of things going on with
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came from the bag seed from the Max T's
and the two other mothers that were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up just looked like tiny monsters.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just grew it from seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely grew it from seed through a
couple in his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how it's going to,
how it's going to end up come harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if he wants to, wants to reassure that
he's got some cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well it looks like he's reassuring
that right now because the cuts are ending
[SPEAKER_04]: up all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a real mutant dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a serious mutant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you don't really mind where I cut?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't mind at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going back to veg for a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez, look at these clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like starting to shrivel up on me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you please put the lid back on and
turn the, the pump on please?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you want to write me a few small
labels, Mac teaser or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can even do it on like an old business
card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can write like that, like four
little Max Emmy acts or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many did you take?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to grab four.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be all secure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a little choppy chopped,
but Hey, that's what happens when you
[SPEAKER_04]: shave clones.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not meant to be kept in your basement.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well it's a different time nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're all sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this nice?
[SPEAKER_10]: Max Tiva from my buddy Ben.
[SPEAKER_10]: Small world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just throw these on top of these
little guys here.
[SPEAKER_10]: She has the little labels.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take a picture of it and I'll be
like, why would you be so gentle with this
[SPEAKER_04]: little guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Give him a little spot for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give these guys a little mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The harmony is like drooping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the wonderful thing about these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put the thing back on, turn the light
on and you're back in business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Phil, I want to thank you brother so
much, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genetic kick down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reefer man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank Doc Atomic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank the great Gardner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank D420K.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank John Burfellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyone else that I'm forgetting that
has passed on strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remo the urban grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got your UBC chemo kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make sure it goes home
with, uh, with Phil as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just cleaning up all the mess that we
made.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, thanks for watching bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is this again, Phil?
[SPEAKER_04]: The sweat band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweat band F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: The F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that you can go to my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clones of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're roaring in that little four by four
monster nuggets.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's another little gift from Phil
and the crew at true genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of their work with an absolute
pleasure get into my garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know what I'm going to
do with it guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to turn it into hash and see
what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that's all I really do care about.
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of this particular aspect of the
plant, the medicinal aspect, really
[SPEAKER_10]: getting that profile off of there and
checking it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to have to chop this guy down.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a little tall for my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'll do honestly right away is I'll
probably cut here and I'll get,
[SPEAKER_04]: this will be a clone and this will be a
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll get two cuts off just this little
top right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go right into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I figure out something else to
get rid of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to get these into your cooler
soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll keep a, keep you guys peeled on
both.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your YouTube channel going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not quite yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you should get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get one true genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be up on true genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put the link in my YouTube channel
comments of this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, you'll be able to watch what he
does with those and you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: watch what I do with these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty stoked man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Found it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back in Toronto on our first trip,
John and I went and visited those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a real nice show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 150 lights or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't remember their names, but super nice
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're watching, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember you gave me the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem?
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said it was good for their cluster
migraine or migraine headache patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned Phil.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start that over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start that over.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing I wanted to mention while
Phil was still here back in, geez,
[SPEAKER_04]: was that March?
[SPEAKER_04]: May.
[SPEAKER_02]: May?
[SPEAKER_02]: End of May.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed a call from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Champs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Champs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were visiting that nice 120 light,
130 light facility John and I got invited
[SPEAKER_04]: to by those fellows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the name, but if you're
watching, remember you gave me the Chem
[SPEAKER_04]: 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it was good for your patient with
cluster migraines or headaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we mentioned Phil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave us this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't touched it or opened it since
and I'm putting it in your hand,
[SPEAKER_04]: brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the cluster migraine headache.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sift that up and get some dabs and see
how it does for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see it come full circle
months later, June, July.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So winding down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a fucking day, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking like, you know, motorbike riding,
eating good food, seeing nothing but
[SPEAKER_11]: incredible mountain scenery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ripping tough the whole time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ripping, dropping down the highway.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, the fucking waterfall.
[SPEAKER_11]: The waterfall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys enjoyed all of it today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were just going to do a
little wine down, kind of say good night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Darren was like, why don't we
smoke one of those fucking hash joints,
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble man?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, shit, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a nice one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those waterfalls with the, with that water
hit me in the back coming off of all that
[SPEAKER_11]: height and everything like that was just
pure fucking energy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Power coming off of that mountain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mother nature at her best.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cooling me down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was all around the board killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to go out on the boat
tonight, but I think what we'll do is
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll start tomorrow out on the boat and
we'll wake up early.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll head down to the boat and we'll go
down on the water, smoke a pure hash
[SPEAKER_04]: joint, listen to a bit of tunes,
maybe go for a little swim in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe find some dolphins, go find some
dolphins and go swim with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fucking cool to swim with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never done the Mexico, Florida thing where
you swim with dolphins, but they're like
[SPEAKER_04]: in captivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely did the jump into the middle of
the ocean when tons of Pacific whites on
[SPEAKER_04]: the dolphins were all around me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of freaky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could be like, these things could
kill me if they want pretty go fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: One time you'd be dying, but they don't,
they're really fast and they're slick and
[SPEAKER_04]: they move all around you and you just feel
like, you know, like, these are multi a
[SPEAKER_11]: hundred pound mammals and they can,
they can swim at you so fast and ram you,
[SPEAKER_11]: take your whole head right off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem like a conscious animal though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the sun's down here on the house sound
right now, both Darren and I are lit up
[SPEAKER_04]: from my metal halide bulb that's behind
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful with the whole garden full
of light.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the whole dark out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It lights up the whole neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does the trees.
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at it last night.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was standing out here smoking one,
just thinking, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one day I hope to have the
greenhouse behind the house here,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for now it's a, it's a decent
facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm able to grow my mother's and my plants
have a couple of tents for blooming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is getting hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Summertime is, is tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any special air conditioning
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my tents get warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely going to end up with a,
with potential bug problem if I don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cut the crop down that's in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the new tent is like, I seen some
white flies in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to fucking figure out
what I'm going to do there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, the good thing is,
is that you have enough that you can take
[SPEAKER_11]: them out individually, clean them up,
put them back, clean it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the stuff that's not flowering
yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you don't have to use anything with
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can just rub all everything off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You really want to get down to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not use your anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, not in bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, pre-bud like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use safer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them a couple of shots of it a month
and just make sure everything's down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way when people come and grab cuts
from me, I'm secure in knowing that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not giving them a bunch of bugs,
but my mothers do hang out outside all day
[SPEAKER_04]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the safer soap is going to
be essential, especially with this hot
[SPEAKER_04]: summer heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's fucking kicking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to find a bed and breakfast for
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at a bunch up on air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a whole bunch of options.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried finding that on my iPhone.
