[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, hey guys, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble Man here and welcome to Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here in my somewhat pre-spring
clean-up garage and I have received a most
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible package in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have received my peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they have a particular name on
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is called, I saw it on the,
ah, the long, the long peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check this out, this is one of the peer
pressure rosin presses that of course if
[SPEAKER_03]: you watch the rosin episode of Hash Church
2.0, I believe it was Eric who came on or
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe it was Josh, one of the other,
maybe both, they came on to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: their unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got the little unit that amps up
the pressure on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got the recipes that you can
program in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really quite a nicely advanced unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell that it's a rosin press,
not started by cannabis aficionados,
[SPEAKER_03]: not started by welders, but started by
engineers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a combination of the three in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're going to do is we're going
to do a little unboxing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you guys stay tuned for the
uncrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, great looking crate.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I spend as much money as I spent on
this unit, they retail for about 8,000 US,
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to see it show up in a proper
package.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be worried about the
integrity of the shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like so far that they've
really done a good job.
Booyah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice that the screws come right out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a difficult battle to get
them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, spoke too soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually I spoke too soon again.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came out quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to get pressing with this unit
and try it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I love for those of you that
are going to ask right away, what about
[SPEAKER_03]: your Sasquatch?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my Sasquatch unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use them all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that this unit
really sold me on was the fact that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could program your batches into the unit,
which is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a person who you're paying
to really know this stuff, but maybe they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have the time to do all the pressing
and they need to retrain some people,
[SPEAKER_03]: a unit like this is wonderful because you
can retrain with the programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got up to 30 programs that this
thing will take and they've all got
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers and you could program for moisture
content, for press time, for different
[SPEAKER_03]: factors in the melt or in the resin,
in the amount of time that you press for,
[SPEAKER_03]: the heat that you press for.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these things are going to be fairly
important and they're the subtle nuances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, look at this right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to bring the camera over and
show you guys what I'm looking at here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right off the bat, we've got some plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some pressure, some screens,
a giant oil slick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice job packaging it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty, pretty heavy for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some scoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they even threw a little butter cutter
in, which is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys have seen these
units, but they are very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come in handy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got all sorts of different brackets,
dual pressure tubing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess there's a little bit of putting
things together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, they even sent a really nice
skillet tool for picking up the resins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what we'll do is we'll pull
this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll pack it over to the left here
and then we'll gain access to what's
[SPEAKER_03]: inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just pack it exactly as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just packing it exactly how it was packed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In here, all sorts of different size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, then what else we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got pure pressure, rosin press,
rosin bag accessory.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quick flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more level has been opened and I of
course want to show you guys what's going
[SPEAKER_03]: on in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like we got t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: T-shirts and of course, how rosin is
pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a nice amount of literature here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure pressure pikes peak and the long
peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the long peak here,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the long peak, the unit that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 by three plates with dual pressure
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% 60 by 61 aircraft grade aluminum heat
plate assemblies with premium heat rods.
[SPEAKER_03]: 60% more available force than the Pikes
Peak V2 coupled with unparalleled pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: control with the dual pressure system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure pressure is industry leading press
wear, full color LCD touch screen
[SPEAKER_03]: technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Press wear offers total control over your
rosin extraction process including the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to save and store up to 30 preset
recipes with multiple pressure stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Premium quality components backed by
industry leader customer service,
[SPEAKER_03]: engineered for long-term durability and
reliability.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Long's Peak is truly built to last.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight tons of force, pneumatic oil-less
and maintenance-free cylinder save up to
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 preset recipes built in Colorado touch
screen LCD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds pretty good to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to getting in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put the camera back on the
tripod and we're going to further open up
[SPEAKER_03]: the package here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the professionalness of the packaging
on this unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely stellar.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really well, well done here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dinging and a beeping, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to look.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna look.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let me open this up a little
bit more because for some reason I'm way
[SPEAKER_03]: cut off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, so, okay, well let's flip it up I
suspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's our unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that we're not balancing on
these components.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to find the start of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got this sucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see it packaged so
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, packing's arrived in the past
and I've just been blown away that the
[SPEAKER_03]: product A even made it in the first place,
but just that, you know, someone would
[SPEAKER_00]: sell such a nice product and not package
it up the best that they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I think what we're going to
do is lay it down on these.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there's the little amping unit
that goes on the side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like I've even already got plates
and the plates that they sent me were just
[SPEAKER_03]: merely extra plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got our long peaks, pressure gauge
that goes in on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing these are probably some legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed they do look like some legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some large brackets for the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to have to get the Allen
key out for this little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make it happen here in a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wanted to show you guys this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered some parchment from these guys
and check out the professionalism on these
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment slabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's literally like a thousand pieces
of parchment in here pre-cut perfectly to
[SPEAKER_03]: fit into the press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to get that ready right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Corey or from, from ACCA
alternative cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is consumption awareness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys saw, but we did a
little thing about six months ago to maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit longer now even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it in around six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we did a little demo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of on a Google chat,
Skype type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Corey ran the process in front of a
group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All about safe extraction methods and
rosin pressing is definitely one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: top things on our list for safe
extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the peer pressure, the long
peaks, longs peak press from peer
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, we just did a little test run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's dark, but we really wanted to
share this with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't want to wait till tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got the unit set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the beautiful touch screen right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the plates heating up to 210 top
and bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to show you with the camera
up close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, why don't I do it right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Show you right this second.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we got going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing what they've got in this,
uh, this press for all the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the screen that we're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can heat up your plates by
simply clicking on that and going save.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will save, uh, save your plate at
the temperature that you're putting in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a little mistake there,
so I'm just going to fix it, get it back
[SPEAKER_03]: to 210.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've got a recipe that we're running
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're going to put that on and we're
going to put that on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to run recipe number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see flour, um, 10, 10 grams on the
two by nine bags, 115 microns,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, medium pressure, medium speed,
sorry, with 16% humidity or moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see our air pressure is a kind of
low over here, but we haven't turned it
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also I want to show you another
part of this press.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool, which is on their
website as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they've got the safety emergency stop
right here that you can just hammer down
[SPEAKER_03]: and that stops the whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they've got the dual buttons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One on the left and one on the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this allows you, you hold these down
for five seconds and that engages the
[SPEAKER_03]: press.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't move the plates par se,
but what it does is it engages the press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this particular one also has
plate speeds, how fast and how slow
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is the real doozy right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the dual unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the amping up of the pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming in at about 25 to 30 PSI on
the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming in at about a hundred on the
right and you can probably hear a tiny
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of a leak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have the Teflon tape,
but this is something you're going to want
[SPEAKER_03]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're setting this up, I can feel it
leaking right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a tiny little bit should be okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the little toggle shift that
allows us to go back from A over to B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where most of the pressure is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to, you'll see us using the
toggle to the right more often than the
[SPEAKER_03]: left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I guess, uh, Jay is over here
preparing the flowers and what we are
[SPEAKER_03]: using is some beautiful, beautiful where
is my bike?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys know this one very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a solid, solid, solid yielder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the unique terpene profile with a
good yield, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We flipped the bag inside out already.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, I didn't have the tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to show you guys this really
cool tool that these guys came out with
[SPEAKER_03]: flip a bag, another bag for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've got this very simple,
simple tool that I'm sure anyone can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna shut that door there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's inside out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, you got the seam on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right side out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your tube in, push your other tube in
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that just flips the bag just like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to use that tool to press out
the corners to make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you won't get any product caught
in that seam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what we want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on top of that, they have these cool
little funnels that fit right into their
[SPEAKER_03]: bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling you, this might look
simple and not that impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was stoked when I watched the 10 grams
of powdery bud just flow right into the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get back to this here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: This peer pressure unit is just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long peaks for those of you interested in
finding out more, you can check it out at
[SPEAKER_03]: peerpressure.com and this is the,
I love it when you go through and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see the watery view through the plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a little parchment holder here
that you can use if you decide to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't use it the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had a couple of magnets that we
used, but yeah, very, very cool little
[SPEAKER_03]: unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this unit has these feet on the
end of it, but it also has some other ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that go on and put feet here as well as
screwing into the back feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can move this whole unit down to
lay down on its side to use as the Elysian
[SPEAKER_03]: research and the gorilla press using the
gravity aid as an extra added bonus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this press does both.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be using it this way today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The press is heated and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, well, why don't I set up the
tripod right on the plates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and let's see what we get oozing out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just work that flower in a tiny bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to get.
Okay.
