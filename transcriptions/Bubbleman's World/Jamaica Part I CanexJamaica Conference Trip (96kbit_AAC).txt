[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here in Montego Bay, Jamaica for the
CanX Conference 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the third annual conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been before myself,
but this is my first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 80 of us speaking at this
conference, and there is a substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of people attending, over 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have just gotten to our place here
in beautiful Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really funny story that I have to tell you
guys about this house that we've rented.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's beyond anything I've
ever rented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge property on a private big
chunk of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we rented an Airbnb,
and we paid, and we went through Airbnb
[SPEAKER_00]: Lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 or 12 hours after I paid,
they called me and said they made a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake and that they needed to refund my
money and that I couldn't rent the house
[SPEAKER_00]: that I rented.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rented something much smaller than
this, much more reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three of us here, so we were going
to split a couple hundred bucks each or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, so we could afford a nice place
instead of getting little hotel rooms like
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else is doing at the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airbnb made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, what are you going to do about
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, we're going to find you another
house, don't worry about it, and if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a difference in price,
we will cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me tell you, the difference of
price on this particular house was
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously about $12,000 or $14,000,
so I'll give you guys a little tour real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the master bedroom that I'm
staying in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite beautiful, nice closets and stuff,
and a little bathroom over there en suite
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see out this window, there's our
little mothership doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll go take a dab real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're upstairs on the second floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entrance to the house just right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see nice windows out there too,
so you can see outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice beautiful staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely bizarre that we're staying
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling them the story, Luke,
about how we got this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just making some video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here, look, he's probably
looking for his buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably looking for his buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bird right there that just flew
by, we had one earlier fly right by my
[SPEAKER_00]: face, and actually he's passed away here,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hit the wall pretty quick, pretty hard,
so we feel pretty bad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a weird vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're gonna have to get him a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know his buddy's out there flying
around, trying to see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take these guys on a little tour
of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we got another bedroom down here
where he has a real nice view and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll come show him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, come check out the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woop, woop, woop, woop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This huge fucking en suite bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pretty sweet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what the?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showed him two rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, this place has like eight or
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another room with a balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this upstairs, but the downstairs
is quite beautiful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's a little lounge for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little room for chilling,
office desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably where I'll be doing
most of my work while I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, yuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you saying, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Woop, woop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so then we got more nails set
up out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to set up as many little areas as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part is, because none of us
really drink alcohol, we've got a dab bar
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we'll be dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice little area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little outdoor shower right around this
corner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinda sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love me a nice outdoor shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor dinner table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another little lounge for watching TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watching TV, Everton?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, what's this, Hawaii 5-0?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so back to our entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our rented van.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some ponds with some fishies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even really looked at the house
from the back, but
[SPEAKER_00]: here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever want to rent a sweet place
in Jamaica, this place is called Tech
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, after a quick tour,
I think we need to go have a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to decide where we want to
have a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get black tape and cut it into the
shape of birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have it on our windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put like a raven, or some type of
bird that they're afraid of, there's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be some type of bird that kills them,
like a predator bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have hawks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hawks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just get stickers that look like
it's got the wings open, and they'll stay
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that landed in the tree is a
chicken hawk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that we have up there is some sort
of pigeon or dove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dove, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have been trying to get him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly why they would be diving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go, we've got to go now,
because he's going to have dinner ready in
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to have a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like, is your nail on?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you turn it on?
[SPEAKER_00]: The back there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clickety click.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have brought all the hash
upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go back upstairs and hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't be giving you guys a tour with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh damn, that bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right buddy, I guess we're dabbing
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bougie bougie.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of my hat, get rid of his shades,
and find my bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hash got to be somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's soaking in for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that is greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice big bottle of water, some ice in it,
and I am ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really using a... Oh, that's what's
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the camera down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the sketch in this, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a tripod with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about as good as it's going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to laugh at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest, it is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy, yummy, yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a bunch of videos
here in the next six days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and get as much footage
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it will probably be from the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get some interviews and whatnot,
but we're also going to maybe go do a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fishing tomorrow, maybe drive to
Negril, and we'll make sure we film some
[SPEAKER_00]: fun videos while we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the beginning of the
Bubble Man Jamaica series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for six days, and I should be
able to release at least let's hope six
[SPEAKER_00]: plus videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
