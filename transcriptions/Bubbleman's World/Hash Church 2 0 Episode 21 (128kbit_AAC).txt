[SPEAKER_14]: Preparing the stream.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are setting up our meeting to go live
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam, give us a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we will say our piece,
which is welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome everybody to Hash Church episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: 21 episode 2.0 21.
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny B's in the house already lighten up
a fatty.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hemp guy's in the house trying to figure
out his camp.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a camera?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny's muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came in muted.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I better be on mute.
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen, we better walk Mr. Sam through
this or he's going to talk over us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to see his little doll.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what can we do for you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to figure out how to turn your
camera on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn my fucking camera on.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's usually on the bottom left where it
says mute and stop video, or it might say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, it's off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now remember when you turn it on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, we almost saw you there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: We saw your elbow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, very well in fact.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very well in fact.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man, that's it's so different starting
this up in the morning from the Google
[SPEAKER_14]: hangouts that I have to admit,
I felt a little bit of nervousness this
[SPEAKER_14]: morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just trying to, it's crazy how fast when I
send out that link, how fast you guys are
[SPEAKER_14]: in here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got to kind of hit the record button.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, how's it going, Debbie?
[SPEAKER_14]: Nah, she's got to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe her mic, maybe her video for video
and microphone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure you have live chat up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm supposed to get a link.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to change the link in
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to know in chat.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're in chat right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I see them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: How come I'm just getting a screen?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably on the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's help Debbie get her microphone
working there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it working or it is?
[SPEAKER_14]: It is now actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, I'm on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been trying to get you on for a
while, haven't we?
[SPEAKER_10]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you guys?
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got Johnny B and Etienne and Spunkman
Sam in the house so far, as well as you
[SPEAKER_14]: and myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: Put the link out to a schwack of people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, oh, they need the link to share in the
other chat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you're in here, can't you just
... I'm sorry, I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm looking on YouTube and I'm not
seeing it playing.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's because you're not looking at the
right one.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't play out of the one that I have
to ... The one I start that tells everyone
[SPEAKER_14]: there's going to be a show tomorrow,
that goes through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to just push a button called Google
Chat and I could go live through there,
[SPEAKER_14]: but now Zoom doesn't hook up that way.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I go live on Zoom, it starts a new
YouTube box immediately.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I just put that into the link.
[SPEAKER_14]: I put it in OG brick.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't post it there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, maybe I'll go over to the other one
and post it because this shouldn't be ...
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm in both right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, you probably want to switch to
speaker view too.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on grid view.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the grid view.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I could change it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We could go to speaker view.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We posted the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm using a microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn it off and see if you
still hear me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you still hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: We can, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my on and off switch on the microphone
is useless.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mic works great, but it doesn't turn
on and off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, as long as it turns on, that's all
that's important, Sam, because we need to
[SPEAKER_14]: hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you don't need to hear me anymore
because you could just read everything I
[SPEAKER_06]: know in my bibliography.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, so what's going on in the world of
cannabis this last week?
[SPEAKER_14]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw some funny stuff the other day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I found an account.
[SPEAKER_14]: On Instagram, and at first I thought it
was going to be one of these sort of
[SPEAKER_14]: trolling accounts that just trolls any
aspect of legal corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, it wasn't all.
[SPEAKER_14]: These guys had a whole bunch of
information about, oh, what's the name of
[SPEAKER_14]: this company?
[SPEAKER_14]: The James E.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wagner Cultivation Corporation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the Raven question, the other
one.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to check out this guy,
James.
[SPEAKER_02]: JWC.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't even believe the stuff that he
says.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: He forgot the word.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess he doesn't use the term entourage.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, well, it's about the cohort
effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: All of our cannabis is 2.5% terpenes
minimum, and it's all about the cohort
[SPEAKER_14]: effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: And trying to listen to this guy talk,
I was like, what the hell is this guy
[SPEAKER_14]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of went in a little deeper and
realized that, I mean, we all know this
[SPEAKER_14]: coming from the industry for as long as
we've been here, but there are absolute
[SPEAKER_14]: frauds entering the industry who are now
just going to sort of fake it till they
[SPEAKER_14]: make it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the things that you hear these
people say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Marcus, I'm really honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I start my cannabis company,
I'm going to call it fraud cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fraud cannabis from Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Won't get you high, but hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it'll get you high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything I say about it will be a lie.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you should do that brand.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we'll release it in California and
we'll see how it goes there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll fit right into the market here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on with your market?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, seriously?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just a nightmare now?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's recovering.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's recovering.
[SPEAKER_10]: At my shop, we lost almost a fifth of our
customers to the underground market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: For a whole year.
[SPEAKER_10]: A whole year.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's starting to come back now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because I mean, so many of our
friends couldn't get into dispensaries or
[SPEAKER_10]: get legal licenses.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what were we supposed to say?
[SPEAKER_10]: The underground market stayed alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if I'm going to make such
restrictive regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then our friends turned to the
underground market to buy their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think part of the bounce back is,
you know, the quality is really up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hardly even believe it myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, we've got all this toxic
products on the market now with these vape
[SPEAKER_10]: pens and that thickener stuff giving
people pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're seeing the bounce back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've almost got all of our clients back
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a cure for pneumonia,
smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, some of those cheap vape pens that
popcorn lung and some of the other things
[SPEAKER_14]: you see going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I saw an article the other day and
they were like, it's an epidemic.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, like more of an epidemic
than half a million people being killed
[SPEAKER_14]: from tobacco every year in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_14]: and like more of an epidemic than three
million people being killed from alcohol
[SPEAKER_14]: related deaths.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I mean, sure, it's probably bad,
but it's got to still be harm reduction to
[SPEAKER_14]: smoking radioactive tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only that, but the newest epidemic in
America is the random mass killers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it used to be once a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's once a week or twice a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was talking to David Downs the
other day, the guy from Leafley,
[SPEAKER_10]: the author, and he said it's that
thickener that they use in the vape pens
[SPEAKER_10]: that the thickener is giving people
pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a side effect of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when it's used wrong and smoked wrong,
you're going to get pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I mean, to the point of harm
reduction now that we know, hey,
[SPEAKER_10]: let's not use that stuff anymore or maybe.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this is why we started testing for
this simple fact.
[SPEAKER_15]: We wanted to know what we couldn't see.
[SPEAKER_15]: And once we started testing, we started to
find all kind of unsavory not good things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's one reason people were
complaining.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, your weed costs more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, we have to test it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to pay employees.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to do all these realities that
come with, you know, staffing 60 some odd
[SPEAKER_15]: people to be here and actually deal with
and handle everyone from patients to
[SPEAKER_15]: retail.
[SPEAKER_15]: So definitely we're seeing a bounce back
from people because they realized that
[SPEAKER_15]: they are getting safe product because
there is a plethora of bad products out
[SPEAKER_15]: there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying every legal products out
there bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, I used to support the black market,
used to be part of the black market,
[SPEAKER_15]: used to purvey some of the best stuff in
the black market.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have great stuff in the black market.
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, still is always moving.
[SPEAKER_15]: They said it was a third.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's probably closer to half now.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the numbers are bigger than what
they anticipated originally.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just the fact of the situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why we need to test everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got any CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sam does not want a CBD, whereas so many
people want it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And on top of that, I'm getting calls.
[SPEAKER_15]: I talk to people weekly who are asking,
hey, where do I get a safe CBD product?
[SPEAKER_15]: What's a safe CBD product I could order in
the middle of Texas and somewhere?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I tell everybody, buyer beware,
you know, caveat emptor.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the reality.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea what's out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have no idea if it's tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask if it's tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we tell people is,
you know, as much as they don't want to
[SPEAKER_15]: hear it, it's safest still in the
dispensary to purchase because it's
[SPEAKER_15]: actually safe, efficacious, as well as
it's been approved, as well as it has lot
[SPEAKER_15]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's a problem, it can actually be
pulled from shelves, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_15]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas in the black market, same thing
happened before 64 happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you don't want it?
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, we'll just take this somewhere else,
which they do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that cannabis goes somewhere else
altogether.
[SPEAKER_15]: And where it goes, nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_15]: And nobody knows to ask these questions
about why does this taste funny,
[SPEAKER_15]: because they're just going with the one
choice their dealer has.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need legalization in every state.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm tired of people in states where
it's not legal yet are going, I got
[SPEAKER_15]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I get a lawyer still?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, there's still a lot of fight
that we have to do from, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: testing to a state, you know, in states
where it's not even considered legal yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, look at Kansas.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at some of the other places in middle
America where, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_15]: wallowing while watching everybody else
get successful or get sick from this
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're watching the full caveat of
reality of what we're experiencing and
[SPEAKER_15]: wondering how can they bring it to their
reality?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'll tell you, Sam, being worried
about not getting CBD, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: it works even crazier the other way
around, because I know someone who's super
[SPEAKER_14]: sensitive to THC does not have an interest
in having it in their body.
[SPEAKER_14]: Purchased a CBD product and I guess it
ended up being contaminated, like vastly
[SPEAKER_14]: contaminated with THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got super cooked.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, she's a mother.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was like, she told me she was about to
go to her kids, like play at the school
[SPEAKER_14]: and had to bring all her other kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was not a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of like, you know,
like we need to make, make sure that for
[SPEAKER_14]: people like that, that aren't really
cannabis users, but they're now using some
[SPEAKER_14]: of the, you know, maybe this person was
just using like a pure isolate and it was
[SPEAKER_14]: working really nicely for them until they
got super stoned.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now they're like paranoid because it's
like they, you know, they took like an ML
[SPEAKER_14]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, it would be like the equivalent of
us eating like a strong brownie or
[SPEAKER_14]: something.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was, she was lit for hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a poster on your wall behind you
from the hashish, the in, hashish in Eden.
[SPEAKER_10]: True.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's one of the originals.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what's funny, me and my wife
stayed there for two weeks in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found that poster out on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_10]: One time, some guy had made a bunch of
them back in India and hadn't found him in
[SPEAKER_10]: a garage and was just selling them on dead
tour.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think they're like real OG from back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: That place was really running.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had like a dozen different kinds of
cannabis and a dozen different kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I had to do was knock on my floor
and somebody would come up and deliver me
[SPEAKER_06]: what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yesterday I was thinking, man,
legalization is nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can get all the best flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's good concentrates, but I can't get
any traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, that alone is probably worth
the trip to the Netherlands just to try
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, you know, we're maybe the homeland
where it's sourced.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were there in 71, 72 when marijuana and
hashish was still legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: They made it illegal a couple of years
later in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that open still or it's long gone?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might be gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's long gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was run by a guy named Sharma,
but I don't remember very well anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Resurrection.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an opportunity right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: One day, worldwide global legalization
hits.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that your spot, Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a picture of my wife and me
thinking our head out of the window next
[SPEAKER_06]: to the sign there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our hotel room.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there you go, people.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a idea and concept in a legal
area that you have seen in the past that
[SPEAKER_15]: somebody who's watching is like,
what could I do in the world of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go open up a hotel in one of these
legal states and provide it for a nice,
[SPEAKER_15]: comfortable place for people to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's Airbnbs, but I don't really
know of too many hotels at this particular
[SPEAKER_15]: junction, unless I'm incorrect.
[SPEAKER_15]: You see the top?
[SPEAKER_14]: There was only about four or five or six
rooms in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check out the top of the sign,
the Eden Hashi Center.
[SPEAKER_14]: What does it say right on the top?
[SPEAKER_14]: Your old and favorite joint.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they used a pun there.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to think that Sam and his wife are
in that picture while it was being taken
[SPEAKER_14]: because that picture is definitely and
that's old Freak Street.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you guys called it or is that
just what this author's called it,
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: It was called Freak Street.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a Freak Street in what was
actually called Chicken Street in Kabul.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Freak Street, Kathmandu, huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you're full of Kabul.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Freak Street for those of you that
wanted to see the rest of Freak Street.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of your old photos, Sam, like
Kathmandu and some of your old travels
[SPEAKER_14]: are, I mean, they're epic.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're literally like you got to do a
book one day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you hate to be photographed and you
hate to be in pictures, but do it when
[SPEAKER_14]: you've gone and passed because people need
to see those images.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel blessed to have been.
[SPEAKER_06]: After I die, I will definitely make a
book.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Once you're dead, you should make a book,
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to get on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But once you're dead,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll puff to Sam being alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm puffing to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm testing the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is one of their little,
I don't know, solvent list number two
[SPEAKER_14]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is everybody's opinion of Zoom
compared to Google?
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the other one called?
[SPEAKER_14]: The other one was called Google Hangouts.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my opinion is that I like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the option of doing like grid view
versus speaker view.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the fact that for whatever reason
on this technology, us not having
[SPEAKER_14]: headphones and constantly muting each
other causes less of a problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like the audio and the video is
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I kind of miss being able to post
right through YouTube the way we
[SPEAKER_14]: originally did, but I figured out a way to
work it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm pretty stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You called it Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you guys fucking back already?
[SPEAKER_11]: About time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We rolled, we did, we rolled 15 hours
yesterday from Edmonton, Boston Creek,
[SPEAKER_11]: and then we went through the fucking Pine
Pass last night at midnight.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pitch black, fucking moose everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fucking unreal, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: What a road trip.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe you're both sitting in the
room right now because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you guys are supposed to be in Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saw you guys out on the road.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were, we went to Slayer, not Slayer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slayer was last month.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Iron Maiden.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Release the Beast?
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Legacy of the Beast.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good game actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never seen Maiden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've never seen Maiden before.
[SPEAKER_11]: And did you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you guys kidding?
[SPEAKER_14]: You've never seen Iron Maiden before.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was your first concert.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've gone to fucking every Slayer concert
that's come to Canada pretty much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maiden we didn't do yet.
No.
[SPEAKER_14]: My first concert was Iron Maiden in 1984.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't an amazing concert.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm for the 88 for the Power Slave.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: They put on great live shows.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you, if you haven't got a chance.
[SPEAKER_15]: The most amazing light show.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what'd you think Darren?
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it worth the wait?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it was fucking awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And listen to this.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're cruising around there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we went to Slayer, the weed
policy at Slayer was you guys go ahead and
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke wherever there's people drinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're allowed to fucking smoke weed too,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we, we, we walked in with our case of
doobies and we smoked all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Maiden was inside.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're allowed to smoke inside,
but we're allowed our doobies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we cruise in there and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't get caught with them.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking for a place to smoke for
about two hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just like, cause we, cause the
VIP thing, you got to go at four o'clock
[SPEAKER_11]: before the concert starts and do all this
rig and roll, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is really cool and fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you miss the lineups to the merch and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're sitting back looking,
okay, well where can we smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_11]: here, man?
[SPEAKER_11]: We find a spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: We go, we go way to the top of this
Roger's place and we go to the stands
[SPEAKER_11]: cause we're going to go to the nosebleed
section, smoke there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this fucking, it's like this steep.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, it's almost fucking scary
standing up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just like, okay, well we'll go
back to the seats, whatever way to the
[SPEAKER_11]: concert starts.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we're sitting right in front of
two security guards.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can't get away with this shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we go to the top, we find a stairwell.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we didn't know the stairwell was
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're waiting for the, we're going to find
the escalator to go down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the guy's like, no, the
escalator's not going down.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to take the stairs or the
elevator.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as soon as you said stairs,
we were like, yes, we go to the stairwell,
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke fucking, there's no one in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We smoke two, three fucking joints right
away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Went and sat down again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we did it, then we did it again,
but we're doing it real sneaky on the
[SPEAKER_11]: other side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you get much higher if you sneak
it in a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were going to do that, but we didn't
end up doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We smoked in the stairwell and when we're
smoking, we still were spark of a joint.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were like, oh, we could hear someone.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're being real quiet and then we can
hear them again.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking around, we're looking,
we come around the corner and there's two
[SPEAKER_11]: people doing the same thing we were doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking, there's someone that we
just started fucking laughing,
[SPEAKER_11]: shared the joints together and fucking
carried it onto the car.
[SPEAKER_14]: And five of getting kicked out of
potentially getting kicked out when you're
[SPEAKER_14]: VIP, you got the good seats.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just, you've traveled 10 hours or more
on your motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like having a super nice hotel.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, dude, don't get us kicked out
of here tonight.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the added risk in front of it all.
[SPEAKER_15]: As Sam said, it gets you just a little bit
higher, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I only got kicked out of one concert and
that was because I took a portable DAT
[SPEAKER_06]: digital recorder with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just pocket size, like a large
Walkman, but they refused to let me in
[SPEAKER_06]: with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I refused to let somebody watch over
it for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Darren.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I'm thinking about at the
concert.
[SPEAKER_10]: You go up to the top so you can smoke weed
and then you have to come down that
[SPEAKER_10]: staircase where every step is a different
size.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like one's a foot, one's three foot,
then two foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like you're holding onto the railing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that happen to anyone else?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, can't they just make standard steps?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the steps were standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You weren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Sam, check this out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's a DAT recorder.
[SPEAKER_14]: For Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, I've got one someplace.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tasty shows from the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_14]: I can almost hear the static and the
coughing in the background.
[SPEAKER_14]: Masters, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Masters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me show you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me show you what's on my wall.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Darren, just for shits and giggles.
[SPEAKER_15]: Real quick.
[SPEAKER_15]: My my foxhole in the Gulf was named 22
Acacia Avenue, which is a maiden song.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that thing, Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, what's Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: It says development of indication specific
cannabis chemo bars to improve efficacy
[SPEAKER_06]: and safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Russo and Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you're going to you're going to need
to read that buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this the is this the poster that was in
Leiden at the International Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_14]: Research Society?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is hilarious, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about that study that just came out
about the cannabis flavonoid that fights
[SPEAKER_10]: pancreatic pancreatic cancer, which is
absolutely terminal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they finally found something that
helps it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis left some flavonoid in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing that's funny for science,
everybody raves about flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you smoke them, they're
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't smoke flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to eat them warmly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
Great.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you suspend them so they won't degrade
so you can ingest them?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know any way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go, chemist.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go, chemist.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go, chemist.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, they'll degrade if you heat them
up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Often like the color that you see in a lot
of cannabis extracts has to degrade.
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you deal with flavonoids?
[SPEAKER_12]: Flavonoids are highly colored and are very
sensitive to exposure to air and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think they're somewhat responsible
for that so-called red ring of death that
[SPEAKER_12]: you often find in distillate where you'll
see the distillate that's exposed to the
[SPEAKER_12]: air often turns sort of like this reddish
color.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that there's flavonoid chemistry
that's involved in that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that for sure, but they're
very highly colored compounds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you have to do, Marcus, leave the
flavonoid in the resin head and eat the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole resin head, but then the THC is not
very active, so you can't win.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't think they're orally
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, certainly there's a lot of
flavonoids in the human diet.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't know about their
bioavailability and what prevalence you
[SPEAKER_12]: get just from like an oral consumption of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know who I think has done some work on
this?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Napro has done some work on this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they have a bunch of unreleased
information on flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, an interesting question for
Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Has anyone ever bred cannabis for
flavonoid content?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there are people who are doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was very interested in flavonoids
after we had discovered in about 2000 that
[SPEAKER_06]: the terpenes had the power to modulate and
potentiate the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to look at flavonoids next.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Dr. Mishulam and Roger Purtry and
a few others told me flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you smoke them, are completely
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're obviously not going to potentiate
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So does that mean raw?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you couldn't like say bake them into a
THC brownie or something like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my gut feeling is if it will
decarboxylate, it will deactivate
[SPEAKER_06]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as fresh as possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're thermally degraded.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, maybe this is an option for,
you know, juicing or things that are just
[SPEAKER_12]: carried out at lower temperatures to
isolate the extract.
[SPEAKER_12]: So so long as the extract's not thermally
or subjected to any heat, it shouldn't
[SPEAKER_12]: degrade the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, again, I know that they're highly
sensitive to air and they oxidize and form
[SPEAKER_12]: very highly colored compounds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so certainly just exposure to air or
shelf life could be an issue with
[SPEAKER_12]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think what they turn into are
actually degradation products.
[SPEAKER_12]: That are also cancer fighting compounds as
well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're just sort of like metastable
compounds that, yeah, do have somewhat of
[SPEAKER_12]: a half life, but certainly have a lot of
biological activity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And flavonoids are rich in in any oxidant
properties and all kinds of things like
[SPEAKER_12]: that because they're they're they're
phenols.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these things react with ultraviolet
light and air like any oxidant should.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave it in the resin head and stick it in
the minus 20 freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me tell you, 10, 20 years later,
99 percent of the flavonoids are still
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was I was contacted this week by a
gentleman whose wife is going through four
[SPEAKER_15]: stage pancreatic cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I put him in touch with that article.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was like, well, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_15]: How do I get it now for her?
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, I immediately shrugged
because I don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the patient a cannabis user?
[SPEAKER_12]: Has the patient?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, she is.
[SPEAKER_15]: She is responding to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have her on different ratios.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's trying the different.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, prior to having her diagnosis,
was she using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_15]: A casual user barely once or twice a year
at a concert or something like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, so this again speaks to that
notion that all cannabis uses is medical
[SPEAKER_12]: because, you know, the cannabinoids,
especially CBD, and like basically act as
[SPEAKER_12]: antioxidants in the body and fight
reactive oxygenated species that end up
[SPEAKER_12]: leading to mutations that cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the great thing about cannabinoids is
they're fat soluble, unlike a lot of the
[SPEAKER_12]: antioxidants in the human diet,
which are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they protect fatty tissues like the
pancreas and the brain and the liver from
[SPEAKER_12]: oxidative damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that might really help
her is to eat resin, in other words,
[SPEAKER_06]: dry sift or water sift that has not
degraded at all and is basically still
[SPEAKER_06]: THC-A because she won't get very high,
but she'll get full flavonoid effects.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to welcome Wade into the room and
Josh and Kelly as well snuck in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't I had to like move the thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Over it was it just showed like five or
six of us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So welcome to you guys as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My video camera is not working today,
so I'm just listening in and I'll pop in
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate you in all forms,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate you in all forms.
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as we can hear your wisdom,
we're good.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's something very soothing about
Wade's voice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he could narrate like a lot of
good shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: He has a gentle timber in his voice that
is very reassuring and calming.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just puts me at ease.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like kind of at the end of my seat
kind of a guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when Wade starts talking, I'm a little
bit like, all right, let Wade talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let Wade talk.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's don't have much to say this morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what I was going to say about
Wade.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I was going to say about Wade.
[SPEAKER_14]: He'll he'll speak when he has something to
say.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: As well about you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm the other way.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just say anything any time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to throw out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the conversation around that
flavonoid and the pancreatic cancer study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, it really brings me back to
cold ethanol extractions and or things
[SPEAKER_00]: that preserve the acid forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole area in these flavonoids
that likely are going to turn out to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting when we get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that thing of feeling like we have to
vaporize or smoke our cannabis in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's a question to the panel.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you guys think about different
cannabinoid profiles being present in the
[SPEAKER_14]: different types of trichomes?
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason I say this is I've noticed
some difference in I've noticed that the
[SPEAKER_14]: differentiator between oil production and
hash production comes from the bulbous
[SPEAKER_14]: head, meaning when I do mechanical screen
separation or water extraction,
[SPEAKER_14]: I can isolate the glandular trichome head
mostly off the capitate stocked in the
[SPEAKER_14]: capitate sessile.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the bulbous tend to sit on that single
type cell and really hug the leaf.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't snap off in the water
extraction process quite as easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they don't really even break off when
you make them extremely cold with screens.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I've noticed is that cultivars
that are high in CBD give very,
[SPEAKER_14]: very little hash from mechanical screen
separation and usually give a much higher,
[SPEAKER_14]: sometimes two times higher.
[SPEAKER_14]: So like literally 50% of the yield is in
those bulbous heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the resin that you get from CBD has a
drier feel to your hand.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a totally, it's definitely
different.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just wonder like if we're ever going
to go deep into what's being produced in
[SPEAKER_14]: those different types of profiles.
[SPEAKER_14]: And is it when you put the two together
that you get this full profile that's hash
[SPEAKER_14]: and when you put the three together,
when you make oil, because I remember from
[SPEAKER_14]: being the bubble guy and being all into
obsessive about isolating out the heads
[SPEAKER_14]: into different micron sizes and realizing
that there were actually different highs
[SPEAKER_14]: and different effects present in those
different size heads, because I'd seen it
[SPEAKER_14]: over and over again, that I started to
tell my oil friends, listen, like,
[SPEAKER_14]: why not make some hash first?
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you make your oil, you've got like
some 90 micron oil or some 70 three micron
[SPEAKER_14]: oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the few that did it were definitely
like had the profound revelation that,
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah, that's quite different.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just wonder if there's going to be a
conversation, if we're ever going to get
[SPEAKER_14]: to a point where we can really decipher,
you know, isolating those heads
[SPEAKER_14]: separately, seeing what profiles produce
in those heads and just seeing if you guys
[SPEAKER_14]: have noticed anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we really want different cannabinoids,
the best idea is to breed it with those
[SPEAKER_06]: particular cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be a great study to do in the
fact that there's so much more testing of
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis now and, you know, labs that are,
you know, looking at different different
[SPEAKER_12]: aspects of cannabinoid chemistry.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's perfectly valid study to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, what's the impact in terms of
the chemical profile on on screen?
[SPEAKER_12]: And it would be an easy study to do,
easy just mechanically.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you had all of the instrumentation at
your access at a place that was growing
[SPEAKER_12]: multiple cultivars, you could generate
lots of data doing that study real quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a good study to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's going to be needing to be
studies plural.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you'd need one on almost every,
you know, macro on that available
[SPEAKER_15]: currently.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you'd also need to start to look
at some other macrons so you can start to
[SPEAKER_15]: reach those so you can isolate those even
smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, as you know, they're in all
different sizes and every different
[SPEAKER_15]: genetic considering its growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say that I really
appreciate the way you pronounced micron
[SPEAKER_14]: macron.
[SPEAKER_14]: I totally liked it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I dug it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to smoke a bowl to it,
in fact, right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's early, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't even busting your ass.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was straight like I I appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was going to say that from a
patient perspective, and when I separate
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do all different, Mark, you've
taught me everything from separation from
[SPEAKER_02]: how to refine my hash even to my my dry
sift and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always talk about the different
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even I have that 304 screen,
it's really fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't press much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the resin that comes from it is just
by far more relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always wondering if those,
you know, has anybody ever tested a
[SPEAKER_02]: different micro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that say I've seen different
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same profile, but just even
cannabinoid levels from what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I would point to the
research of Paul Malberg in the late 70s
[SPEAKER_12]: and early 80s from University of Indiana,
Bloomington, who had a schedule one
[SPEAKER_12]: license and did a lot of his testing just
on hemp, but did do some testing to
[SPEAKER_12]: basically his publication.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got like 12 publications in a period
of about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the generation of cannabinoids
in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he did, you know, these micro
pipetting experiments where he actually
[SPEAKER_12]: went in underneath the microscope and
sucked the fluid right out of the trichome
[SPEAKER_12]: and analyze that by GC.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is back in like the late
70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went and visited his lab at Bloomington,
Indiana University there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's also where Rob Clark went.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was working under Malberg's license.
[SPEAKER_15]: So going off the further off of just even
the macrons, then even the just taking
[SPEAKER_15]: that microns, taking each individual,
each individual one, and then vaporizing
[SPEAKER_15]: it at different temperatures, too,
to also see the different variables that
[SPEAKER_14]: come off of each you know, the one that
I'm most interested in is the difference
[SPEAKER_12]: between the capitate sessile and stock
versus what he found is that there's the
[SPEAKER_12]: what I think I'm redoing this off memory.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I don't get this right, just look up
his papers.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's these cells that are called
the stipes cells, which is kind of like
[SPEAKER_12]: the transition spells between the stock
and the bulbous head.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like right where that right where
the junction of that gland is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's type cells.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think they identify that as being
the area that's basically making
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids, which are then excreted into
these things called plastids, which are
[SPEAKER_12]: these things that migrate toward the edge
of the membrane and create the oil on the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think if I remember correctly,
this is all from memory.
[SPEAKER_12]: So don't get me on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're if you're getting the plant
at the right period of time, you're you're
[SPEAKER_12]: getting it at as that cycle is completed
such that the biosynthetic pathway that's
[SPEAKER_12]: leading to both the terpenes and the
cannabinoid biosynthesis has kind of like
[SPEAKER_12]: completed its shuttle of all of these
compounds from those type cells into this
[SPEAKER_12]: what's called secretory cavity,
I believe it's called.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's just a bunch of these little
vessels that basically have the oil that
[SPEAKER_12]: are like ready to burst or ready to
migrate to the surface of the membrane to
[SPEAKER_12]: release it to the extracellular world.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: He did some incredible work.
[SPEAKER_12]: He really, really did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul Mauburg, that's M-A-H-L-B-E-R-G.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe his paper in the Hash Church Forum
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were also all done by his graduate
student, I think, from Korea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think his name was Soon Young.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget, but he worked on all those
papers with Dr. Mauburg.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to mention how awesome I think
that it was, of course, and standard when,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, Mark mentions this paper from
like decades ago that your that your
[SPEAKER_14]: reply, Sam, is, yeah, I went to his lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: I went to his lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I was there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he was a contemporary.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were contemporary.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were doing this this work at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the beautiful thing is, again,
I think he obviously had to have NIDA
[SPEAKER_12]: funding.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe his material did come from
El Sole's operation down in University of
[SPEAKER_12]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had Carl Hilling working for him,
who did some of the first taxonomy papers
[SPEAKER_06]: using DNA materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent him legally from the Netherlands to
Dr. Mauburg's lab because Dr. Mauburg had
[SPEAKER_06]: a DEA importation license.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, if you look at the way that cannabis
has evolved, the cannabis has evolved to
[SPEAKER_13]: produce terpenes, terpenoids and
cannabinoids throughout its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it expresses the terpenes at different
points, terpenes, terpenoids and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: At different parts of its life cycle and
throughout its plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you look at even at vegetative,
vegetating plants, they're going to
[SPEAKER_13]: contain primarily the sisal stalk
trichromes, which are the hairs without
[SPEAKER_13]: the bulbous trichromes at the head.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those sisal stalks contain primarily mono
terpenes that are that scientists are kind
[SPEAKER_13]: of believing are exhibiting a anti
insecticidal and anti fungal bacterial
[SPEAKER_13]: role.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in order to actually synthesize the
precursors into the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_13]: because those cannabinoids exhibit a
antibacterial fungal and microbial
[SPEAKER_13]: properties, they have to be produced in
specialized cells, the glandular
[SPEAKER_13]: trichromes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what you'll actually see is that in
vegetative stalk and primarily sisal
[SPEAKER_13]: stalk, you're going to have those mono and
di terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas when you start getting into the
bulbous stalk and the glandular trichromes
[SPEAKER_13]: on the sisal stalk,
[SPEAKER_13]: bulbous, bulbous hagen trichromes and
sisal stalk glandular trichromes,
[SPEAKER_13]: those are going to be the ones that are
actually exudating that the two precursors
[SPEAKER_13]: in the that are then synthesized into the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, we know that there has been some
studies produced recently that are showing
[SPEAKER_13]: tricyclic terpenoids even being produced
in the roots.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the more things I've found,
found learned more recently is a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: the precursors that are actually being
produced by the precursor terpenoids are
[SPEAKER_13]: translocated through symbiotic
relationships in the roots, in the in the
[SPEAKER_13]: root zones, through symbiotic
relationships with microbiome in the soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: That means the soil microbiology,
the fungi which are bringing nutrients to
[SPEAKER_13]: the roots, and then the bacteria are both
trading terpenes in exchange for sugar
[SPEAKER_13]: from the from the roots, because
obviously, fungi don't produce sugars,
[SPEAKER_13]: sugars are produced by photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the plant will actually exudate sugar
into its root zone in exchange for
[SPEAKER_13]: minerals as well as nutrients that are
traded symbiotically between bacteria and
[SPEAKER_13]: the cannabis roots.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as the cannabis absorbs those minerals
and transfers them up the stem,
[SPEAKER_13]: some of those trichromes are going to get
exudated into the sisal stalk,
[SPEAKER_13]: the non glandular trichromes.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it isn't until the trichromes exude
the THCA synthase or CBDA synthase in the
[SPEAKER_13]: glandular trichrome that you actually get
that conversion from the precursor mono
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenoids into the di or tri terpenoid
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember the name of a student,
Dr. Malberg, who's Ensu Kim.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to drop the mic for Mike,
because that was really, really well put.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I loved listening to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it really was a beautiful scientific
explanation why a cannabis plant seems to,
[SPEAKER_14]: for a fact, express itself so much more
abundantly when it's got that living soil
[SPEAKER_14]: that it's growing out of, when it's got
that entire living, you know, bacteria,
[SPEAKER_14]: fungus, all of those things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Working together to, like you say,
trade terpenes in exchange for sugars.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, that was a really beautiful
picture you painted there, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also, go ahead, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_15]: You succinctly broke it down, you know,
very eloquently, actually, because people
[SPEAKER_15]: wonder the difference and always ask,
well, what's the difference between soil
[SPEAKER_15]: and hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, right there alone is an
understanding on why the uptake and what
[SPEAKER_15]: you're looking at scientifically at the
end.
[SPEAKER_14]: So someone should write down at 42,
at 42 minutes, Mike West came in and
[SPEAKER_14]: started to drop, drop the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also, it's good hash church,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for coming.
Yeah, boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Using a lot of hash water on our plants
that are about three to four weeks into
[SPEAKER_08]: flower right now and trading that terpene
rich water and those waxes and those water
[SPEAKER_08]: soluble terps and enzymes that come off of
the, the trichome and go into the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we spin it with like a,
oh, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_08]: The plaster, like on a drill, like you
might, we use that in the water just to
[SPEAKER_08]: agitate just the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we gravity feed it into our
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that that goes into the soil
food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know, I trust that the microbiology
knows what to do, that the plant knows
[SPEAKER_08]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can take those, that the raw material
from the plant before and synthesize those
[SPEAKER_08]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It don't want them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wants sugar that it can trade from the
terpene.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's microbiology.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can, the plant's going to produce sugar
and exudate that sugar into the soil,
[SPEAKER_13]: but humans culturing cannabis can actually
contribute to that soil microbiome.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's things, you know, fresh plant,
plant juices or fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now is actually a wonderful time for
everybody who's watching past church.
[SPEAKER_13]: If they have fruit, fruits or berries in
their local environment, they can actually
[SPEAKER_13]: press those plant juices.
[SPEAKER_13]: We may not have time to ferment them,
but obviously pressing a plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: plant juice, incorporating that into your
compost tea or into your watering
[SPEAKER_13]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, if you add blueberry juice to
a compost tea that's brewing today and
[SPEAKER_13]: water it into your plants tomorrow,
that may add some of those blueberries.
[SPEAKER_13]: Blueberry terpenes to the soil that the
soil microbiome is going to absorb,
[SPEAKER_13]: potentially translocate.
[SPEAKER_13]: The micro bacteria will likely use the
sugar.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll, it'll consume it and turn it into
CO2 before it even gets into the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: that those terpene terpenes in soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they have much of a half
life.
[SPEAKER_12]: If the bacteria is right, you know,
that bacteria will consume those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just feeding the bacteria in the
soil by putting that organic matter in
[SPEAKER_12]: there now, locating terpenes into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plant doesn't have any problem making
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't need to move terpenes in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, it's not that you're taking
terpenes from the plant, sticking it
[SPEAKER_08]: straight into the root and getting
terpenes out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not, that's not what we're
implying.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're implying is the trans... You're
feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're feeding soil food web, the
intelligence of the microbiome and the
[SPEAKER_08]: microflora within the soil knows what to
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It exchanges the information with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the plant says, Oh, I have
nutrients and, and, you know, hormones to
[SPEAKER_08]: work with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where you just trust and,
you know, evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I just wanted to add really
quickly to what Mike was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been doing fruit ferments,
you know, for 20 years plus, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's always the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the apples are ripe or the plums are
ripe on our property, that that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll start to do ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to tell people at home
that it's really important that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with fruit and fruit
juices, it can turn to alcohol incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly, especially with your fall fruit,
because you've got a lot of wild yeast on
[SPEAKER_01]: the outer coating of that fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will change very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always tell people that if you're
going to be doing any type of a fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: ferment, that it's really just for a
couple of days and make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: testing it and really looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just turns to alcohol super quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will definitely kill a lot of the
microbiology in your soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, St. Bernard's observation booth who
is, uh, seems to be a smart fellow in the
[SPEAKER_14]: chat room is agreeing with Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's saying it's the microbial metabolites
that the plant uptakes is what will
[SPEAKER_14]: increase terpenes, but who knows,
maybe we'll learn something new about
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis with the way it operates and
works.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't pretend to think that we know
everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that we think we do, but there's
always breakthroughs every 10 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seemingly there's some sort of a new
breakthrough where we understand a new
[SPEAKER_14]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to put words in Mark's mouth,
but what I think he was saying was that if
[SPEAKER_06]: you put terpenes in the soil and they're
uptaken by the roots, that's not going to
[SPEAKER_06]: make more terpenes in the resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but by feeding, by providing the
precursors, which are oftentimes
[SPEAKER_13]: degradates of what you feed to the roots
and by up, by providing more of those
[SPEAKER_13]: nutrients that can be absorbed,
be symbiotically traded for sugar with the
[SPEAKER_13]: roots.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're essentially increasing the
fertility of the soil, which then
[SPEAKER_13]: increases the bioavailability of those
nutrients to the roots.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think all you're doing is you're feeding
the nitrogen fixating bacteria that the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant relies on because plant doesn't fix
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the bacteria and the microbe and
the biome and the soil is sort of
[SPEAKER_12]: symbiotic with the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in order to get soluble nitrogen to
make the DNA and the protein and the
[SPEAKER_12]: enzymes that actually do the, all those
atheists, you know, the synthases,
[SPEAKER_12]: those are all proteins and those proteins
all need nitrogen and it needs to be
[SPEAKER_12]: soluble nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think it's just, yeah,
I mean, like you guys have already talked
[SPEAKER_12]: about many times feeding the soil and the
symbiotic relationship that the soil has
[SPEAKER_12]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you remember, Mark,
but in the sixties, people used to hang
[SPEAKER_06]: their plants upside down when they dried
them because they thought all of the THC
[SPEAKER_06]: would come from the roots and drip down
into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was still believed into the nineties
for people there, Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess some people, yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and the roots don't produce THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: They produce tricyclic terpenes and
bicyclic terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just at a Amish tobacco farm last
week and there's some truth to that in
[SPEAKER_12]: tobacco drying apparently is that,
yeah, they do hang the leaves upside down
[SPEAKER_12]: and you start to actually see a collection
of oil kind of as the plant dries and
[SPEAKER_12]: shrivels up of tobacco oil, I guess,
or exudate or whatever the hell it is,
[SPEAKER_12]: toxic shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And boy, I tell you what, I've never been
to a tobacco farm before.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is intoxicating when you walk up to one
of those drying barns that just chuck
[SPEAKER_12]: filled with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's... And that's automated
man-bred tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you grow the medicinal Indian varieties
that they used to smoke before white men
[SPEAKER_06]: came, let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you even touch the plant, there's so
much resin on those tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no conception.
[SPEAKER_01]: In herbology, whenever you're drying or
you're working with herbal remedies,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're always drying it upside down
because of those oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the very end of the plant is
where a lot of the medicinal values are
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular plant, which is where it's
gonna dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna have a slower dry, which makes
a lot of herbal plants more medicinal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And harvesting them at dawn is the most
medicinal time to harvest your herbs with
[SPEAKER_08]: the highest terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I was just wanting to talk about
a little bit about the living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that people who are cultivating in
deep living soil, we are preparing and
[SPEAKER_01]: creating cannabinoids that we don't even
know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know about yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's an incredible
relationship that goes on within the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere that's giving the medicinal
values within the trichomes of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have a beautiful soil,
then you're giving ultimate potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular varietal or that
particular chemovar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that putting in its most
natural environment with the best food
[SPEAKER_01]: possible for the proper microbiology,
then you're definitely gonna get the
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate potential that you can out of
that strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it's really hard to tell,
but we were showing some of these hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: varietals that were growing this year,
and they're just unbelievably filled with
[SPEAKER_08]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're really excited to see what's
gonna happen this year with the testing
[SPEAKER_08]: and the, I mean, the trichomes are going
all the way out to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't look like a cartoon filter from
like an app to anyone else, because it
[SPEAKER_14]: looks super trippy when you hold that up.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can tell it's frosty, but it looks
like a trippy filter to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now, in the way that we're
breeding our hemp and the way that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been upping the CBD values and a lot of
the breeding here, we can't actually tell
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference at all now after working
with it for so long between our THC
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our hemp varietals and our high CBD
varietals are starting to create way more
[SPEAKER_01]: smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes coming out of the greenhouses
are just really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they hybrids between drug varieties
and CBD hemp varieties?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have both on the property.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have hemp varieties that we've
collected from Colorado and Oregon that
[SPEAKER_08]: are open to breed, and we've been breeding
with those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you analyze hemp varieties,
they have a whole different suite of
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes than marijuana drug varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've just been doing quite a bit of
testing, and we're really noticing full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, a whole bunch of them are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever Anandia Labs is testing for,
all of them but a couple are not present.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all there, which is really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really being able to tell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're mixing the drug cultivars with the
CBD cultivars, as well as CBD with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're having a lot of success
in both of them, but incredible yields and
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichomes are just huge this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have everything from spectrum
number five box, auto, cherry wines.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Ringo's gift, Harla Sue's,
Ringo Harla Sue's.
[SPEAKER_01]: ACDC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Abacus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Healer Strain, which is a one-to-one
ACDC to 840, which is ours.
[SPEAKER_08]: A Temple Spice, which is a THC variety
that got a lot of CBD in it recently in
[SPEAKER_08]: the last couple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're definitely noticing that a
lot of our high THC varietals,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we're working with them, is starting to
show more full spectrum cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our CBD production is absolutely going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in cultivars that weren't showing CBD
before are showing CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that this is part of living soil
and the relationship with that rises here
[SPEAKER_01]: that brings out the ultimate potential
that I was talking about before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to give you skunk number one to
grow because it has a non-functional CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read it that way on purpose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's what I love about the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like fractal medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just comes out whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many terpenes do you get in your
analysis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've never tested for more than
about 75.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only 36.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only able to test for 36 right now,
and we're showing pretty much about 34
[SPEAKER_01]: being present in a lot of our varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's 150 that are known so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's just we don't have access
to that type of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more that we're learning and more
scientific knowledge and money is being
[SPEAKER_01]: dumped into cannabis, then people who are
home growers even and people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to up their breeding program
will have more access to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: better at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any grower would want the best test that
they could get.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it not an issue that all labs test a
little bit differently?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we speak to that?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we get all labs to create similar
data?
[SPEAKER_05]: Standardization.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: The issue with lab variation comes from
because when you look at the way that labs
[SPEAKER_13]: run their equipment, A, they have to
perform an extraction on their equipment
[SPEAKER_13]: to make it into a soluble form that they
send through the machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not all extractions are done the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondarily, the way that they run their
analytical equipment is not using the same
[SPEAKER_13]: standardized formula.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then obviously there are standardized
samples that you can get from cerulean or
[SPEAKER_13]: standards, but not every lab quantifies
those standards the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you run a GC or HPLC on a method
that takes five minutes to run or 10
[SPEAKER_13]: minutes to run or an hour to run,
you're going to have much better
[SPEAKER_13]: resolution on the longer runs.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it obviously has a larger cost to run
it for an hour versus five minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any lab that's testing wants the five
minute run because they can run more
[SPEAKER_06]: customers through their machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we see in the recreational
market.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to try and run as short of a
lab as possible to get as accurate as
[SPEAKER_13]: possible, but still be within a acceptable
margin of error.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then as long as the consumers aren't
complaining, they're not going to read
[SPEAKER_13]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my machine, they would show around the
six minute mark to the eight minute mark,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the different cannabinoids over that
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing with the GC that Paul used
to run too.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then they're also supposed to
calibrate that machine after each test as
[SPEAKER_15]: well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that you're supposed to, at least when
I was originally doing it and actually
[SPEAKER_15]: working on the testing here in the US.
[SPEAKER_15]: But prior to everything, I always showed a
calibrated machine before the test was
[SPEAKER_15]: even done.
[SPEAKER_13]: How many standards?
[SPEAKER_15]: 1,500.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because when you do your calibration
curve, if you run it once with one
[SPEAKER_13]: standard serial dilution of a standardized
sample, that's going to give you a good
[SPEAKER_13]: standard.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you run it at six different
dilutions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you don't need to run that between
every standard.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to basically ISO certified labs
that do this in the non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: industries basically have to do that
calibration maybe quarterly or maybe three
[SPEAKER_12]: times a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, if you're using a standardized
method where you're talking about
[SPEAKER_12]: measuring cannabinoid concentration,
yeah, you're going to be probably looking
[SPEAKER_12]: at anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes per
test.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have to do it in a way that,
again, just as reproducible from lab to
[SPEAKER_12]: lab to lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of sort of hyping
numbers in the testing industry to make
[SPEAKER_12]: sellable flowers in new markets because it
seems as though I can't imagine cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: flower being greater than 30% in THC,
but I see it all the time from labs that
[SPEAKER_12]: are basically certified or running
equipment.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the labs that sell product in
places like here's ATN.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, the point is that,
yeah, do we need standardized testing
[SPEAKER_12]: methods?
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: But part of what hinders that is the whole
schedule one thing because some of these
[SPEAKER_12]: companies are even still scared to sell
the equipment that's required.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the companies that have sold,
like Shimazu and other companies that are
[SPEAKER_12]: basically customized their equipment to do
cannabinoid analysis.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can basically get an HPLC for well on
the order of about $50,000 US that can
[SPEAKER_12]: basically measure cannabinoid
concentration to the degree that the
[SPEAKER_12]: industry needs to by a standardized
method.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe even their analyzer has internal
standards already built into the machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't quote me on that, but I think you
have to still get the standards every
[SPEAKER_12]: quarter and just do a calibration curve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You run it through a GCMS and do it once
and then you've got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and then your GCMS is also going to
give you a way of determining whether
[SPEAKER_12]: there's trace other things like solvents
or other because the GCMS is a lot more
[SPEAKER_12]: sensitive and it could basically sniff
cocaine off of a dollar bill that's in
[SPEAKER_12]: anyone's pocket.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it's a very, very sensitive technique
for basically determining trace amounts of
[SPEAKER_12]: contaminants that could be in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, now you're talking about a
piece of instrumentation that runs north
[SPEAKER_12]: of about 150 thousand dollars and you
really need to have a trained chemist or
[SPEAKER_12]: scientist to basically operate this
because it's not a trivial piece of
[SPEAKER_12]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_15]: To clarify, gentlemen, to clarify what I
was talking about with the testing in
[SPEAKER_15]: between is when we come up with the actual
standardization.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying what was there and to
clarify further, I was going to say it's
[SPEAKER_15]: falling now more on human error and
depending on who's working in the lab
[SPEAKER_15]: currently now more so than anything which
is because we've seen also an expenditure.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was one thing when I was working
one-on-one with a lab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you're talking about 3000 samples
coming in and they're being absolutely
[SPEAKER_15]: overrun and then trying to find qualified
people to do anything from pipetting to
[SPEAKER_15]: getting everything up and running happens
to be the biggest problem because I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: having people come planning and saying
they're failing because the calibration or
[SPEAKER_15]: the cleaning machineries are off gassing
is actually on the actual test.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you bring up a good point and a lot
of the error that's introduced into these
[SPEAKER_12]: measurements is the actual sample handling
itself where not only it runs the risk of
[SPEAKER_12]: having contamination but there's just so
many places where error can happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not just the mixing up of samples if
you're running hundreds of samples a day
[SPEAKER_12]: in these labs but just the notion that
again there's a systemic error in the SOP
[SPEAKER_12]: itself where you're constantly getting
either a high or a low result because of
[SPEAKER_12]: the way the sample is weighed,
the way the sample is prepared.
[SPEAKER_12]: As Mike was saying, cannabis isn't soluble
so if you're sending in flour it has to be
[SPEAKER_12]: dissolved so if you're doing a weight
determination for how much percent of THC
[SPEAKER_12]: is in a sample that's a weight
determination so you have to weigh
[SPEAKER_12]: material.
[SPEAKER_12]: It means you have to have somebody who's
competent that's able to use an analytical
[SPEAKER_12]: balance and weigh down to 0.1 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not just anybody- And a proper
representative sample as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you get a proper representative
sample?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: What if the customer gives you a little
bud for testing but he just- It's funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just by analogy, we're going through this
in Pennsylvania now with hemp and so what
[SPEAKER_12]: the state requires is a sample of the hemp
to basically certify it's below 0.3% THC
[SPEAKER_12]: and they don't care and there's nothing in
the regulation that says when or where you
[SPEAKER_12]: take that sample from so here we are
probably like a month before harvest and
[SPEAKER_12]: we're basically just clipping leaves off
the plant and saying, okay, state,
[SPEAKER_12]: here's your test result.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're bringing up a really good point
which is the sampling and how do you use a
[SPEAKER_12]: certificate of analysis in a laboratory
result regardless of how precise that
[SPEAKER_12]: result can be, how do you use that result
to characterize a bulk sample of cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: or hemp or whatever and so I'll point to
the Oregon folks seem to really think this
[SPEAKER_12]: thing out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the Oregon reg is the one that
I've read.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've read the California one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've looked at a couple Woody other ones
in other states.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seems like the Oregon folks give us a lot
of good thought on how to basically
[SPEAKER_12]: statistically represent a large bulk
sample of medical cannabis, how many
[SPEAKER_12]: samples, individual samples and how like
if you're looking at like a five gallon
[SPEAKER_12]: pail or a bin or whatever you're storing
your cannabis, they actually talked about
[SPEAKER_12]: dividing it up in sectors and taking a
sample from each sector and going lower in
[SPEAKER_12]: the barrel and I don't know who's got the
time to stack their barrels with high
[SPEAKER_12]: testing cannabis on the top, low on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard people who spray the tops of
their barrels or whatever with distillate
[SPEAKER_12]: so when the testing labs come in,
they can try to get a higher test result
[SPEAKER_12]: because boy, that'll make it through the
marketplace quicker because it tests
[SPEAKER_12]: higher for some reason.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, the consumer who walks into the
regulated market who feels that again,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in a dispensary so I'm already paying
top dollar.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna make a choice based on THC
content when I make my purchase so the
[SPEAKER_12]: test results have a lot to do with what
moves off the shelves and so yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean there's a lot of moving parts here
but to go back to the original question
[SPEAKER_12]: and then I'll shut up which is that we do
need a standard set of tests but I would
[SPEAKER_12]: say that again, if you got either the
Shimazu cannabis analyzer or any current
[SPEAKER_12]: form of HPLC that's gonna require again,
calibration, as long as you stick to the
[SPEAKER_12]: SOPs for cannabinoid separations,
there's really good analytical methods to
[SPEAKER_12]: give you baseline separation of all the
major cannabinoids and so with that type
[SPEAKER_12]: of testing available, I'm sure that this
will be something that won't be something
[SPEAKER_12]: that will be unknown in the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: People will be able to have access to
these results.
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's companies that take out of state
samples now.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a new thing because with the hemp
industry opening up, it was difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: Say if you weren't in California where SC
Labs is, how do you get a sample tested at
[SPEAKER_12]: SC Labs?
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there is mechanisms to send state or
sample samples across state lines so it's
[SPEAKER_12]: becoming a hell of a lot better.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you what, it really is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's try and look at how we can set the
example, what I guess CBD extractors or
[SPEAKER_13]: hash extractors can look for.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that when I've built my labs and
there's especially the labs in Oregon for
[SPEAKER_13]: CBD, we were sourcing biomass from various
farms in and around our region trying to
[SPEAKER_13]: minimize the distance from the farms that
we had to ship it but we would always,
[SPEAKER_13]: obviously the farmers had to test it
before it could be sold to the processors
[SPEAKER_13]: to certify that it was under 0.3.
[SPEAKER_13]: The minute we start processing it,
in Oregon for example, Oregon passed a
[SPEAKER_13]: rule in their administrative rules
committee that allowed for the product to
[SPEAKER_13]: be sold after it tests below 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when the processor processes it,
it may go above 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as you have a COA, independent
third-party analytical test result that
[SPEAKER_13]: certifies it below 0.3% THC, with that COA
you can then sell the lot that's.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, that's right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the interesting scenario.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that there's interstate commerce
thanks to the farm bill, when those
[SPEAKER_12]: tractor trailers or train cars get pulled
over, how do they know?
[SPEAKER_12]: They're based on some piece of paper but
boy that stuff still smells like cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: back there and you're looking at a huge
tractor trailer that's just full of hemp
[SPEAKER_12]: pulled over on the roadside of I-95 in
between Philadelphia and New York City.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just going to be really interesting
to see about the transport and how this is
[SPEAKER_12]: kept distinguished from medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pennsylvania is going to figure out how to
get its tax out of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to have to be detained.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to have to be tested and it's
going to have to find a lab to actually
[SPEAKER_15]: test it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the reality is this time is going to
have to happen and it's going to be a long
[SPEAKER_15]: slow process and somebody is going to be
the test case and it's going to be a very
[SPEAKER_15]: expensive and a very sleepless night
situation for those people.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those test cases are already ongoing.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been truckloads seized in Oakland
and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been truckloads seized in southern
Idaho.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but it's going to have to be in
between in each individual state until we
[SPEAKER_15]: have an actual federal law, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because as you know, something passing
through Oklahoma or Kansas is going to be
[SPEAKER_15]: different compared to like Texas.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm watching sometimes I will watch live
PD and watch these cops now struggle
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's a CBD pen.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to actually field test that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you and I know also those field
tests will fail saliva even.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just terrible tests.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're watching actual officers right
now struggling with that because Texas has
[SPEAKER_15]: a law that allows for CBD, but no THC
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can still go to jail and watch this
girl get arrested for actually having THC
[SPEAKER_15]: in her pen.
[SPEAKER_15]: So she was actually arrested and thrown in
the pen where the cops are just like,
[SPEAKER_15]: eh.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's still a conundrum even in these
states, depending on the access of the
[SPEAKER_15]: legal as well as.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Texas is medical CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't even they don't even allow CBD
for hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no gas station CBD there because
there's gas station CBD everywhere,
[SPEAKER_12]: everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see ACM came out with a study that
14 percent of Americans are using a CBD
[SPEAKER_15]: product?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and it's great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's critical.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's it's the healing of the
nations, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's if anything, it's going to open up
the doors.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I was surprised when I saw CBD in
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_13]: But Kansas has a state program allowing
CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: And within within a month of Kansas
allowing commercial CBD, there was CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: being sold in gas station.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you familiar with the paper by Mark
Lewis from NAEPRO?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's called Development and
Validation of a Robust Analytical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen that paper?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the Gizey paper?
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't Gizey?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ryan sent me that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about time around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, that that's that's a that's a
superb method.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also Justin Fischedeck.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know where Justin is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Justin's at one of the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Justin's across the street from me over
here at IAS, the original lab I've worked
[SPEAKER_15]: with.
[SPEAKER_12]: Justin published a great paper on
correlations between different varieties
[SPEAKER_12]: and terping profiles.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's published a couple with Jeff Raver.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's a few few good methods
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to the NAEPRO lab in Sacramento,
and it's the best lab I ever saw working
[SPEAKER_06]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been to Dr. Brennan and I've been
to Dr. El Soles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to all of the top labs and I
thought they were the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the way that these GCMS works,
we used to use GCFID.
[SPEAKER_12]: FID is just an acronym for flame
ionization detection.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the way GC works is it separates
mixtures of compounds based on their
[SPEAKER_12]: different boiling points and different
temperatures at which they boil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the most volatile ones kind of come
through the column first and the higher
[SPEAKER_12]: boiling ones come through the column
later.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what the FID was was just a sniffer at
the end of the column that just smelt a
[SPEAKER_12]: compound coming out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It would burn it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the intensity of the flame was
correlated to the peak height because the
[SPEAKER_12]: more intense the flame was, the more
compound was coming out.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the higher the peak would be.
[SPEAKER_12]: So mass spec, what you're doing is you're
putting that column now into a mass
[SPEAKER_12]: spectrometer, which fragments the molecule
and creates what's called a mass spectrum.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's how the molecule shatters when it
breaks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so each molecule has a different
pattern.
[SPEAKER_12]: Each terpene, each cannabinoid,
the way that they shatter creates a
[SPEAKER_12]: different mass spectrum.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so those are included in a library of
compounds that's maintained by N I S T,
[SPEAKER_12]: the National Institutes for Standards and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so these libraries are all inside the
software of this instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when they're looking at all these
compounds coming out, they're able to
[SPEAKER_12]: identify down to a Nat's eyebrow
everything that's in these mixtures.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just routine analytical
chemistry that just has been happening in
[SPEAKER_12]: the food and non-cannabis industries for
years in the chemical industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's great that these instruments have
now been applied to looking at these
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the point is, Sam, is that the
paper that you're recommending was
[SPEAKER_12]: actually carried out, I think by FID,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was a GCF ID method,
but you could easily- I know in their lab
[SPEAKER_12]: they had mass spec, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can easily- I don't remember
exactly the paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can easily apply that method,
which just uses flame ionization detection
[SPEAKER_12]: to mass spec detection.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a different kind of detector.
[SPEAKER_06]: The detector- Of course, once you run a
set of analytical samples, then if you
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't have it in your library already,
now you've got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, with the hydrogenated
cannabinoids, that's how we knew we had
[SPEAKER_12]: something new.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was nothing in the library.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were like, oh my God, there's nothing
in the library.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's something in the library now
that we've made it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it becomes, yeah, a great detective
identification tool to identify whatever's
[SPEAKER_12]: in a mixture or an extract or a formulated
product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you don't need analytical standards
anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's not like you don't need
analytical standards.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the analytical standards, what those
are used, and this is what Mike was
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about earlier, is to develop a-
Calibrating the machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, to develop a calibration curve.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you want to understand.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you get one of these
chromatograms, you get a bunch of peaks,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Which looks like a mountain range.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what you want to be able to do is
correlate the peak area underneath the
[SPEAKER_12]: peak to the concentration of the compound
that gives rise to that peak.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the way you do that is you run that
test on that pure analytical sample at
[SPEAKER_12]: different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you plot on one axis, the
concentration, and you plot the absorbance
[SPEAKER_12]: on the other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you generate a line, which in optical
spectroscopy is referred to as Beer's law.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Beer's law is the law that the darker a
solution is, the more there is of that
[SPEAKER_12]: analyte in the solution.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absorbance is directly proportional to the
concentration of whatever you're
[SPEAKER_12]: measuring.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so those calibration curves,
it's very important.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this speaks to how we get
consistent methods throughout the cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: industry is that the labs who are doing
the testing, who are doing routine testing
[SPEAKER_12]: and testing hundreds of samples a week
have to stop once a quarter and basically
[SPEAKER_12]: show that their calibration curves are
giving a linear relationship between the
[SPEAKER_12]: different concentration of the samples and
what they're reading from the machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes what you'll see is that as
the column begins to fail, or if they have
[SPEAKER_12]: problems with their peristolic pump,
which pumps the fluid through the column
[SPEAKER_12]: as it runs, you start to get variations
either at high or low concentrations and
[SPEAKER_12]: deviations from linearity along that
curve.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's important to be able to show
that, yeah, you could run hundreds of
[SPEAKER_12]: samples, hundreds of samples, but you have
to be able to maintain that linear
[SPEAKER_12]: calibration curve.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you don't, alarm bells should go
off.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's even programs that,
as the machine runs, lets the user know
[SPEAKER_12]: that, hey, we're starting to get something
that's deviating, or you start to see
[SPEAKER_12]: what's called a floating baseline where
the baseline and the chromatogram starts
[SPEAKER_12]: increasing and that just means that more
shit's going.
[SPEAKER_12]: In this case with HPLC, you're doing a
detection by ultraviolet visible light.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're taking the ultraviolet visible
light as the fluid comes off of the column
[SPEAKER_12]: and the different cannabinoids have
different ultraviolet spectrum.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're able to determine which
cannabinoid is which, and also by running
[SPEAKER_12]: standards.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing that standards provide is
that if you have an unknown peak and you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't know what it is, you could spike
that sample, say, is that thing THC?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you could spike it with Delta 9 THC
and see if that peak grows.
[SPEAKER_12]: If that peak grows, then you know that
you've identified the peak.
[SPEAKER_12]: But these chromatography methods or
devices are very useful for analyzing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first lab opened in 2008.
[SPEAKER_12]: First testing lab.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been testing on cannabis dating
back decades, but obviously the first
[SPEAKER_13]: available ones couldn't offer the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the 90s, I built it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the commercial labs testing for
commercial decoders only came after
[SPEAKER_13]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was saying that I built it only for
in-house use because we were
[SPEAKER_06]: plant-breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis breeders and we used it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kept it full.
[SPEAKER_06]: We ran 50 to 100 samples a day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, and that's what I think a lot of
because none of the states started
[SPEAKER_13]: licensing cannabis, no commercial labs
opened up until after we started seeing
[SPEAKER_13]: medical states opening up and off having
that need.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think as legalization progresses
worldwide, we'll start to see more
[SPEAKER_13]: standards, more validation on those
standards.
[SPEAKER_13]: Labs actually being held responsible to
validate their lab standards, whether
[SPEAKER_13]: monthly or quarterly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when we start to see that
deviation from those standards,
[SPEAKER_13]: then obviously labs want to be able or
need to be able to shut down and either
[SPEAKER_13]: replace their column, replace their pumps,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure that they can fall within those
state or mandated standards.
[SPEAKER_15]: We started in 08 and 09 with testing here
in California.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we didn't have any access to lab or
information.
[SPEAKER_15]: We tried to reach out to the research
triangle at the University of Mississippi
[SPEAKER_15]: and they laughed at us.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was in like 07.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in 08, we started to reach out to Ethan
Russo and some of the other people and
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to find the right people to
actually find, to bring to the United
[SPEAKER_15]: States, to actually have the actual
calibration liquid and equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't know you back then,
Sam, because I wish I would have known you
[SPEAKER_15]: because it would have made it a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: But who helped me set up my lab was Dr.
Brian Eisen in Switzerland and Dr. Hal
[SPEAKER_06]: Solway in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_06]: They both helped me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they weren't so happy to help us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to do ring testing where we would
send the exact same sample to all three of
[SPEAKER_06]: us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we didn't come out with the same
results, we knew something was wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We came out with the exact same results.
[SPEAKER_15]: I longed and dreamed that you people
existed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And apparently you did exist.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just we didn't necessarily touch base
back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also see a head start.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to Dream Catcher in the room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Alec, Alec Dixon in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, good morning and good morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been talking about labs for a bit
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just making it to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You like rock me out of bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we've been going deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been going very deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been talking a lot about analytical
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some testing with the green cross
there with Dr. Hornby back when it was 06
[SPEAKER_02]: just after my accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I got hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned about decarboxylizing and
how those brownies affected my pain
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I kind of really found out
about analytical testing and started
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing all that great wonders of cannabis
at the beginning there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 607.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some exciting times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without labs, as a breeder, you don't know
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the ability to test the flower and
we have the ability to test the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the cannabis industry, we're really
getting good at both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that I'm really interested
in is the actual reaction from the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: into the flower, which is really starting
to test the endophytic reaction that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if any of you all know of
any labs or anybody who is testing
[SPEAKER_01]: endophytes within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really is super exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, taxol from the yew tree was
people were getting bark, wanting to
[SPEAKER_08]: extract taxol to cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But after further testing years later,
they realized there was endophytic fungi
[SPEAKER_08]: and endophytic bacteria that was pulsing
in the cambium between the yew bark and
[SPEAKER_08]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the endophytes were extremely
medicinal towards cancer and other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we started looking up endophytes in
cannabis and there's minimal papers on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one paper I found located that
there was up to 30 endophytic fungi in
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the endophytes were good to fight
powdery mildew and butrytis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other endophytes were impossible to fight
cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not talking endomycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not talking about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about endophytic fungi and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: That live inside plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like it may be a whole new
medicinal frontier.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering if any of you all have
learned about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just wanted to kind of jump in on
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's one of my most passionate
and exciting kind of directions of where I
[SPEAKER_09]: see things are going.
[SPEAKER_09]: In so many ways, cannabis now,
especially what we're seeing in California
[SPEAKER_09]: with as much testing as being required,
we're seeing so many of the things that
we're seeing in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering
if you all have learned about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did somebody freeze up on us?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, his mic went dead for some reason.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, he froze.
[SPEAKER_14]: He froze.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we'll just build on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've taken out information to make our
hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, as we harvest the hemp, we harvest the
roots thanks to Ethan Russo and some of
[SPEAKER_08]: those papers that have been written on the
roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also use parts of the stock and
seeds in our medicine, because we,
[SPEAKER_08]: when you talk about whole plants like
Marcus's shirt, you know, or whole plant
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine, you know, we're looking for the
full range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really awesome because you found
papers, you know, that date back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fifties that look at hemp and they're
finding up to 30 different varietals of
[SPEAKER_01]: endophytic fungi within the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say like a tomato or some of our other
food plants or maybe tobacco or corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really only going to have a couple
of different varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super interesting that cannabis has
so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that that's definitely playing
in with cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Alex, now that you're about to hear
you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you for your patience there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just connected the wifi,
so I'm golden.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, what I was kind of just wanting
to kind of share with everybody here kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of in response to the endophyte.
[SPEAKER_09]: Endophilic, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Endophytic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, so anyway, so the way I was
going on that thought is like,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, in so many ways, you know,
so cannabis testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: we've been deep in, this is our 10th year,
this is our decade of doing it,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, kind of we started towards the
end of 2009.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so being on this journey of analytical
chemistry with cannabis and the science of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis has been, you know, one of the
most educational and magical experiences
[SPEAKER_09]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in so many ways, especially,
you know, over the last few years,
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing the transition to this new space of
regulated, kind of tested, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: these minimum quality standards that
people have to meet to kind of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, get product out in the market,
you know, in so many ways now,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we're seeing the most
fascinating trends around all the fails,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so my job in such a big way is
whenever a compliance fail happens and
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody has to destroy product or
immediate the product, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: that pretty much means they're never going
to work with us again, because there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: $50,000 plus loss.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so what we found really early on
last year when testing kicked in is,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the buck doesn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you, if you were as a lab or just
delivering a fee for service tests and the
[SPEAKER_09]: certificate of analysis and then bad news,
you know, you know, with somebody having
[SPEAKER_09]: to destroy hundreds of thousand dollars
product, then, you know, sure,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're never probably going to work with
you again, but what else do you bring to
[SPEAKER_09]: the table?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's really where we've drawn on
our past decade worth of experience of
[SPEAKER_09]: being in service to this plant and knowing
this plan as well as we do both like,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, on the kind of cultivation,
many manufacturing level, but also then on
[SPEAKER_09]: testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so one of the things, and this is,
I guess, the big point of what I was
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So cannabis, this, you know, this great
bioaccumulating plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: now that we've tested it to higher
standards than any other crop that's ever
[SPEAKER_09]: been tested, you know, we're, you know,
the testing is almost like showing this
[SPEAKER_09]: voice of the plant that's speaking about
the legacy of the toxicity and the
[SPEAKER_09]: contamination that's happened in all these
major agricultural areas, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: that are, you know, and so, so in so many
of these areas where the microbiome has
[SPEAKER_09]: been desertified, you know, and,
and now it's just eroded, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: soil that just kind of super high or just
super low pH, you know, super kind of high
[SPEAKER_09]: levels of heavy metals and residual
pesticides from the environment,
[SPEAKER_09]: from the neighboring farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's dirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's dirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no longer soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and so, so, so in so many ways,
like we're seeing this in California,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're seeing this massive movement towards
kind of the establishment of Appalachians
[SPEAKER_09]: of origin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And protected terms, you know,
and, and I love this conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to be speaking at a
Appalachian conference symposium at UC
[SPEAKER_09]: Berkeley in the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but basically, you know, what we're
seeing is, you know, Appalachian is
[SPEAKER_09]: something in this new world that you have
to wear, whether or not you like it or
[SPEAKER_09]: not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, you know, in certain areas,
you know, the Appalachian that you're
[SPEAKER_09]: growing in is almost going to be seen as
like a, as a scarlet letter, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's like, I've, I've begun to
basically by the like five or six
[SPEAKER_09]: different pesticides that will show up
either in flower or plant material or an
[SPEAKER_09]: extract.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've begun from the,
from the routine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had over a thousand of these fail
calls over the last year, but now I can
[SPEAKER_09]: begin to predict the Appalachian that was
grown in by the pesticide signature that
[SPEAKER_09]: accompanies the crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's one of the most mind blowing
things I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I can predict if it's grown by the
almonds and Stanislaus or by the avocados
[SPEAKER_09]: and Carpinteria, because this Appalachian
signature is following the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's the worst case, I think of
the Appalachian conversation of where I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing it go, but on the other side,
unlike with, you know, with, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: pale Elaine Ingham and soil food web and
all the like pioneering work of all the,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, cannabis legends that have been
trying to push the boundaries on organic
[SPEAKER_09]: farming to regenerative farming to like
understanding the symbiosis that exists in
[SPEAKER_09]: nature and how, you know, to really talk
terroir and Appalachians of origin,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, you're, it's, it's the micro
planet region of the area, but it's the
[SPEAKER_09]: soil microbiome that exists.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, and, and, and, and real
quick, just a rapid point.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so with, with that being said,
you know, we're, you know, I've been to
[SPEAKER_09]: several Elaine Ingham compost two
workshops.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were starting to do some of these
trials, but you know, they're showing
[SPEAKER_09]: whenever the soil microbiomes ideal,
you know, for the crop being grown
[SPEAKER_09]: comparatively to say hydroponically grown,
uh, like tomatoes or other types of
[SPEAKER_09]: fruits, you know, you can track the
doubling of the secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_09]: being produced in the plant, whenever the
microbiomes ideal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it probably has something to do with
these endophyte or just certain types of
[SPEAKER_09]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_09]: But whenever, you know, those,
and so, so, so if you can, so if
[SPEAKER_09]: something's growing in the perfect
microbiome and one of these real clean
[SPEAKER_09]: areas that aren't, that haven't been
bombed on for 40, 50 years by ag,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, where there's soils actually
rich and flourishing, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can actually begin, we're,
we're starting to begin to track the
[SPEAKER_09]: secondary metabolite production being in
cannabis, which are terpenes in this case,
[SPEAKER_09]: and other minor compounds that we're not
even testing yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I, but in so many ways I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That as one of the biggest competitive
advantages that a cannabis farmer has in
[SPEAKER_09]: this new world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause if you were able to produce quality
fire, quality cannabis that has,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, these markedly expressed higher
amounts of these secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_09]: like terpenes, as opposed to some of this
monocrop cannabis that's grown in ag land
[SPEAKER_09]: that doesn't have the secondary metabolite
boost, but instead has this pesticide
[SPEAKER_09]: signature accompanying it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like, it's a really
fascinating way to kind of look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: field in front of, in front of everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And who, who really, or who's really at an
advantage, you know, even if somebody's in
[SPEAKER_09]: a small, you know, more, you know,
small farm side of things, instead of like
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 acres monocrop, you know, who's really
at an advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where analytical testing really
aids the regenerative farmer or different
[SPEAKER_08]: bio regions, which are essentially
Appalachians because as South Africa and
[SPEAKER_08]: Columbia and all these countries come in
with thousands and thousands of hectares,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, you gotta be like, Oh,
am I going to be able to sell,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the weed still?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're like, yeah, you're definitely
going to because of the certain bio
[SPEAKER_08]: regions that you live in a certain
terroir.
[SPEAKER_08]: And through analytical testing and soil
testing, you'll be able to show the purity
[SPEAKER_08]: and show maybe the unique chemo bars that
you have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's extremely valuable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people trying to flip the,
people trying to just grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: now that it's make hemp great again,
and this whole movement of, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: all the farmers just going for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you, if you shift,
you know, a thousand acre GMO corn farm
[SPEAKER_09]: with glyphosate and everything else in the
soil, you know, I mean, like, I think a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of the testing kind of eventually
wants it, you know, you, do people then
[SPEAKER_09]: have to either go straight to isolating
CBD to a single molecule, just to purify
[SPEAKER_09]: it, to not fail, you know, or they're
going to have to go grow rope for 10
[SPEAKER_09]: years, you know, while they sit this one
out and figure it out, then clean up the
[SPEAKER_09]: environment while everybody else is able
to, you know, kind of show what they've
[SPEAKER_09]: done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, cause it's almost like chickens
come home to roost moment, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: for farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Appalachian in Los Angeles, indoors,
under lights in, in container soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that, what's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a silly proposition.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would jump in here with a
conversation on California's version of
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with the work, the Appalachians
working group in Sacramento with CDFA and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a, there's an important
distinction to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what the folks in Los Angeles would
like is for state law to change so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can designate a geographic area of
origin, which fits right into what Alec
[SPEAKER_00]: was just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not Appalachians of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians of origin are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to do with standards and
practices and cultivars, at least by law
[SPEAKER_00]: here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two different programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Appalachian of origin program,
which is very exclusive, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it requires creating a local
Appalachian group that then applies to Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis for permission to have an
Appalachian of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the geographic indicator system is
what LA is after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And state law allows a county of origin
designation on packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we'd like to see here be changed
is it could be, and there is a bill in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature to make this happen,
that it would be a city or county of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would allow the LA indoor growers
and the San Francisco and Oakland indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows Alameda County as a source of
indoor cannabis, but people know Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, there are two different
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to distinguish
between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The geographic indicator county or city of
origin is a very inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes everybody that's doing
cannabis activity in that geographic area.
[SPEAKER_00]: An Appalachian of origin is a very
exclusive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: In France, with wine, you have to grow it
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't add large amounts of fertilizer
to grow more grapes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: They prefer candy dirt soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, France is that there's actually,
Appalachian de origin, the French term,
[SPEAKER_13]: is actually fairly well protected in
France just because of the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it traces back to different types of
wine being grown in different Appalachians
[SPEAKER_13]: in France.
[SPEAKER_13]: That way they could produce uniform wine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whether that wine has distributed
throughout the world, if it says it's a
[SPEAKER_13]: burgundy wine or says it's a champagne
wine, we know that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: produced in that region under the same
soil with the same weather.
[SPEAKER_13]: That way, if you try one year versus a
different year, you can see variation
[SPEAKER_13]: within the year.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you try two different wineries from
the same year, they should have fairly
[SPEAKER_13]: uniform grape.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's a great way for,
because everybody's focusing on trying to
[SPEAKER_13]: grow a thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_13]: What they don't realize is that you're
going to make way more money as a craft
[SPEAKER_13]: farmer growing high quality flavors in
biodynamic soils, producing phenomenal
[SPEAKER_13]: flavors that are going to be either
extracted or smoked or even consumed for
[SPEAKER_13]: the flavonoid profile, because all those
other terpenes, not the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_13]: are going to be what increases the value
of your CBDs or THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to that point too, I think in this
world where the big ag approach towards
[SPEAKER_09]: monocropping, towards moving it to
conventional ag land has happened,
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost feel like the plant's trolling us
in this way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in this great time of
legalization, where everybody's coming in
[SPEAKER_09]: to take their piece and to crush the
competition, it's actually setting people
[SPEAKER_09]: up for massive failures that we're walking
through every day around these unavoidable
[SPEAKER_09]: residual environmental contaminants that
have become legacy to that land as a
[SPEAKER_09]: result of the green revolution and as a
result of post-World War II practices
[SPEAKER_09]: around petrochemicals and nerve agents
being now used on growing plants and
[SPEAKER_09]: keeping away pests and pests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to look on the bright side,
after 100 years of growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil will be pretty clean now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_09]: And after a bunch of people have to go
grow rope for 10 years, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: these people, I'm watching it happen,
they're being forced in these positions
[SPEAKER_09]: where there's these certain regions that
are almost getting blacklisted as a result
[SPEAKER_09]: of these consistent... So many people are
spinning their wheels.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're building out these $25 million
manufacturing facilities, and then they
[SPEAKER_09]: just have people on the road going to all
the mega farms looking for material.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're taking samples of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're taking a representative sample of
say that thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're micro extracting it so they can
concentrate anything off of it to see if
[SPEAKER_09]: it tests clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they bring it to the lab to test,
test dirty, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people are just spinning their wheels
in this time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we're seeing is so many of the
small craft farms that have the quality
[SPEAKER_09]: ingredients that are preserving their
terpenes, that are diversifying their
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are starting to lock in long-term
trim contracts with these people for like
[SPEAKER_09]: $500 to $800 a pound for trim in this
moment where nobody can even get rid of
[SPEAKER_09]: their trim in a lot of these other areas
unless they're going straight again to
[SPEAKER_09]: isolate or remediation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so in so many ways, I feel like it's
not only creating this barrier of entry
[SPEAKER_09]: for people to come in and try to pilfer
this plant, and it's giving this massive
[SPEAKER_09]: and robust advantage then to the people
that have taken care of this plant,
[SPEAKER_09]: that have been a steward of this plant for
so long that haven't destroyed their
[SPEAKER_09]: environments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then through that, I think it's also
helping to raise the awareness to the food
[SPEAKER_09]: we eat and what's on the food.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I don't want to smoke kind of
black seed or any other pesticide or
[SPEAKER_09]: fungicide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why would I want to eat it?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really, in real time, see kind of
this effect on the plant exactly like
[SPEAKER_09]: you're saying, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like it's going to have this effect
on shipping ag.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's trolling the people that are wasting
money trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: You grow for money, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because a lot of those people are going to
be planting in contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: The plant's going to bioaccumulate all of
that stuff in various different parts of
[SPEAKER_13]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen the plant will accumulate some
of the heavy metals in the seed husk,
[SPEAKER_13]: the seed shell, but it actually will
bioaccumulate other pesticides in other
[SPEAKER_13]: parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to mention radioactive nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so it's going to bioaccumulate it,
but it's going to bioaccumulate it in
[SPEAKER_13]: different parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So no matter what your crop's going to be,
you're going to have to be able to test
[SPEAKER_13]: and identify what those bioaccumulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's really important to test
your inputs as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then as you're developing that
process, obviously using those
[SPEAKER_13]: contaminated biomass, there's ways to
clean it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have competent labs and then
competent analytical labs that can help
[SPEAKER_13]: you develop that to remove those
contaminants, but you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_13]: go through a greater amount of refining.
[SPEAKER_13]: So then there's going to be a market for
distillate and isolate because it's easier
[SPEAKER_13]: to export to the 3% or 1%.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that said, everyone who watches
HashChurch obviously understands that
[SPEAKER_13]: higher quality is more desirable than
bulk.
[SPEAKER_13]: So being able to produce, having quality
as well as trying to develop quality into
[SPEAKER_13]: scale, it's going to end up having better
results for the farmers and better results
[SPEAKER_13]: for the hash makers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mike, real quick, a question for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've recently started to conduct a
series of experiments because we have this
[SPEAKER_09]: hypothesis that a lot of the
bioaccumulation of metals and pesticides,
[SPEAKER_09]: we are seeing a bioaccumulation through
the plant of whatever the toxin is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heavy metals, we're really seeing kind of
on the flower whenever they're being
[SPEAKER_09]: foliar applied.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water and a combination of foliar inputs
are being foliar applied every five days.
[SPEAKER_09]: So accumulation of metals we're seeing on
flower happening much more from foliar
[SPEAKER_09]: applicants than from soil coming up
through the roots and the stalk up into
[SPEAKER_09]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: What metals?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I ask what metals?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those metals in the water?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my second question is, are they
watered overhead by pivot or are the
[SPEAKER_13]: fields flooded, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that changed the delivery on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we see a 2% fail rate in flower for
heavy metals, 1% for arsenic, 1%
[SPEAKER_09]: separately for cadmium.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so all over the state.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we see... What's the failure
rate or what's the threshold that you have
[SPEAKER_12]: to meet below?
[SPEAKER_09]: 200 part per billion, 0.2 ppm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this is just like, isn't that
ridiculous, don't you think?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, 2% fail rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, 2% fail rate is not like the
reason for the thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is anything in the state of California
below 2, whatever, pp billion?
[SPEAKER_09]: We only see 2% fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, 98% is passing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, so real quick, so... I guess
it's either going to be contamination from
[SPEAKER_13]: mining or lumber.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then... I think a lot of it... If I
could jump in for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it's coming from folks
who are foily or feeding as versus
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding the root zone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and that's what we've found.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because one of my biggest parts,
the biggest part of my job is when
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody's failing, I engage in a root
cause analysis and we go through a series
[SPEAKER_09]: of environmental assessment tests,
such as testing water, testing all the
[SPEAKER_09]: individual foliar inputs that you're
adding to the mixes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with 95 plus percent confidence,
we've begun to identify the foliar inputs
[SPEAKER_09]: more so than the water that you're feeding
into the roots.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can take any really high level
arsenic, guanos, and all these other
[SPEAKER_09]: things, and they're going to accumulate in
the plant, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_09]: bioaccumulate to the fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was having a series of conversations
with Roy Upton, who's the executive
[SPEAKER_09]: director of the American Herbal
Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he wasn't actually surprised by the
fact that there was such a low fail rate,
[SPEAKER_09]: a flower 2%.
[SPEAKER_09]: And whenever he was getting into it,
he was making the comparison of American
[SPEAKER_09]: ginseng, because with American ginseng,
it's a perennial plant that grows year
[SPEAKER_09]: after year in the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so through the monograph process,
they were actually able to identify the
[SPEAKER_09]: doubling each year of heavy metal
accumulation in the plant as it's growing
[SPEAKER_09]: in the soil year after year.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was saying, well, with cannabis,
since cannabis is such a short flowering
[SPEAKER_09]: annual plant, maybe if it flowered another
18, 25 weeks or something, maybe there'll
[SPEAKER_09]: be more of an accumulation further from
the roots to the stock up into the fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the fact is, we're not seeing the
craziest fail rates in flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when we are seeing it, it's being kind
of correlated back to the water,
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's like, are you filtering or
unfiltering your water for what you're
[SPEAKER_09]: spraying on the plants?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the start.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's like, OK, well, guano,
seaweed, fish, pH ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've tested four part per million of
cadmium and botanogard with just a series
[SPEAKER_09]: of different kind of both beneficial or
biological pesticides or for your sprays
[SPEAKER_09]: and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess the big part of where I was
kind of going to with this is in monocrop
[SPEAKER_09]: farming cannabis, we have this hypothesis
that whenever you if you're row cropping
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 acres of cannabis, you're no longer
harvesting it with the sanctity at which
[SPEAKER_09]: we've harvested this plant all our life,
which is where you take the inflorescence
[SPEAKER_09]: of the plant, the sugar leaf, the flower,
you're separating it from the stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: But whenever you're talking about farming
with tractors on this level and you and
[SPEAKER_09]: you're truly farming for biomass where you
chip in the stock back with the flower so
[SPEAKER_09]: you can do these industrial scale
extractions on it, you know, we're really
[SPEAKER_09]: curious as to whether there's going to be
like multiple time increase in metals and
[SPEAKER_09]: also potentially pesticides because you're
using the stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're almost it's almost again,
the plant trolling us.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't play.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't fucking harvest this plant like
broccoli or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and and whenever you if you're
going to try to harvest it in this way,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's not cherishing the flowers and all
the, you know, the part of the plant that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you use the stock, is the stock
going to bring about like five times
[SPEAKER_09]: contamination concentration on top of the
fact that you're already contaminated in
[SPEAKER_09]: the agri.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it all has to do with, you know,
we can lurk in it to great growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can lurk in it to the way that you the
some Japanese gardeners will, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: cut down and only grow melons in one
specific way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll put them in shape so that they
grow a heart shaped melon that they can
sell.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in Japan, that kind of craft
melon production has melons selling at
[SPEAKER_13]: dramatically higher prices.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that really boils down to,
you know, good genetics of the plants,
[SPEAKER_13]: good terroir, which can be how the plants
are grown, how it's cultured and et
[SPEAKER_13]: cetera.
[SPEAKER_13]: But in many cases, they're taking much
more care of the plant than they are
[SPEAKER_13]: growing it on and trying to grow it in
mass.
[SPEAKER_13]: When we're growing monocultures of CBD,
you have to take more, it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_13]: have the labor that's incorporated in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're going to see stratification in
the CBD industry where a craft grown CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: flower can reach a premium.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas if you grow it in the desert for
biomass, it's not going to produce as many
[SPEAKER_13]: of those monoturpenoids because a lot of
those monoturpenoids are going to get
[SPEAKER_13]: blast off during the drying due to the
desert.
[SPEAKER_13]: For isolate production, there's use for
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But like you said, if you're not removing
those fan leaves, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: increasing the amount of wax concentration
that's in your blend of biomass.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not removing the stems,
you're going to be able to pull whatever
[SPEAKER_13]: is potentially bioaccumulated in those
stems.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're trying to extract seeded
bud, you're not only going to extract the
[SPEAKER_13]: oil that's in the seeds, but you're going
to extract some of the heavy metals that
[SPEAKER_13]: are found in the seed coat that are
bioaccumulated in the seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody's asking, but what about
chemtrails?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's really funny about chemtrails is,
I mean, like what's funny about chemtrails
[SPEAKER_09]: is everybody always thought when heavy
metal testing kicked in, the areas where
[SPEAKER_09]: that are highly sprayed, we're going to be
the ones that just had the craziest degree
[SPEAKER_09]: just fail rates for metals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, we're testing for cadmium,
we're not testing, I mean, in the idea of
[SPEAKER_09]: what the thought of what has been in
chemtrails, you know, maybe we should,
[SPEAKER_09]: if we tested for more metals would see,
but we're not seeing any type of insanely
[SPEAKER_09]: higher rate of fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you testing for aluminum?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so aluminum, no, well, so the
California panel, when we test the full
[SPEAKER_09]: library, we test, we're building up like a
prop 65 metal test to test for,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, how many total metals are on
that list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, like, you know, the,
the kind of throughput service we offer is
[SPEAKER_09]: primarily for these four regulated metals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lead at 500 part per billion mercury at
100 per per billion arsenic and cadmium
[SPEAKER_09]: each at 200 per per billion.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, like it was,
it was interesting because everybody,
[SPEAKER_09]: whenever phase three kicked in at the
beginning of two, you know, this year,
[SPEAKER_09]: 2019, um, and heavy metal testing was part
of the regiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, everybody was thinking it was going to
be this extinction level of that and
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody was going to be dead and just,
it was going to be the thing that killed
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody's business.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it's been quite the
opposite of what we've seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: again, it's, you know, these, these really
low percent fail rates, like lead,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're almost exclusively seeing as a part
of the manufacturing process, cartridges,
[SPEAKER_09]: particularly, but also, you know,
shitty cheap Chinese glass and other types
[SPEAKER_12]: of, you know, leaching, um, any shiny
metal from, from China could potentially
[SPEAKER_12]: be the, um, be contaminated with either
lead or cadmium or nickel, or I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: surprised just given the whole Aaron
Brockovich thing that Cali hasn't also put
[SPEAKER_12]: chromium on that list, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Chromium six is another bad actor.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting because chromium three is
fine, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: You can buy chromium three at GNC and pop
a couple capsules of it today,
[SPEAKER_12]: but chromium six is that's the Aaron
Brockovich chromium, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the bad chromium.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the chromium that they use to coat
airplanes and ships with and shit like
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mark, you know, what's, what's
interesting about the whole thing is cause
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, California, from, from what I see
did, didn't, you know, they, they learned
[SPEAKER_09]: and advanced past kind of all the,
you know, some mistake mistakes of the
[SPEAKER_09]: previous States that regulated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, some say they went too
far, but again, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: whenever you look at these, like,
you know, California average fail rates
[SPEAKER_09]: across all these different categories,
it's not as gnarly as, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody thought, you know, once these
minimum levels of quality hit,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we've seen, you know,
from before regulation to after,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, almost like 50, 60% reduction in
a lot of these common pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of making it through to the final
retail space.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, like with, with the metals and
with pesticides though, there,
[SPEAKER_09]: there could be more, more compounds added
like chromium six, like nickel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been hearing, I've been hearing of
nickel poisoning being out, out breaking
[SPEAKER_09]: from like cartridges and like nickel play
cartridges, but then also glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_09]: how much glyphosate sprayed in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're, we're, we're seeing kind
of hemp farmers that are desiccating 30
[SPEAKER_09]: acres of their tomatoes so that they can
kind of pull that out and then replant it
with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hemp, you know, is that going to be
poison?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Smoking reports that I'm seeing in the
news or what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Micro cards.
[SPEAKER_09]: Micro cards.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's unknown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I mean, that, that's a whole other
e-juice.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do the e-juice thing is one of the
gnarliest things I've ever seen in my
[SPEAKER_09]: life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I was puffing those jewels really,
really tough.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started doing a pretty quick,
pretty big assessment of the e-juice,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, because somebody told me that
it's like the E that e-cigs and the
[SPEAKER_09]: nicotine that come from these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I was sitting there just puffing one
of these jewels and my buddy was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude, you're really smart.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I can't believe you're just
popping up and he's like, where do you
[SPEAKER_09]: think that nicotine comes from?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like synthesized nicotine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's like, no, dude, it's the hot dog
water distillate of the tobacco crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, and so I immediately went
back to her.
[SPEAKER_09]: I submitted
[SPEAKER_12]: that it's more isolated, like,
like cocaine would be because it's an
[SPEAKER_12]: alkaloid.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can crash out the hydrochloride salt
of.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so, so I'm sure, well, I'm sure I'm
sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, cause that's what's real quick,
real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause Mark, that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're seeing if we test a bunch of
tobacco, like Marlboro and all these other
[SPEAKER_09]: kinds of, um, conventional grand critical
agro crops, we see a series of pesticides,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: A cat one, cat two pesticides,
different concentrations, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_09]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we're testing e-juice, we're almost
exclusively seeing dimenoside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alar, also known as Alar, you know,
like so dimenos, because there's certain
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds, like even micro butanol is an
example, like that needs some,
[SPEAKER_09]: some pesticides in the extraction process
will separate with certain processes,
[SPEAKER_09]: non-polar polar, you know, with this
filtration, these different things,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we're seeing other ones, you know,
will kind of linearly concentrate with the
[SPEAKER_09]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what's, what's really, really
weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only 20 degrees off of, uh,
but I don't know what's up in the
[SPEAKER_09]: dimenoside conversation, but dimenoside,
you know, phospholode, flower dragon,
[SPEAKER_09]: this plant growth retardant, you know,
that was part of the Alar scare of the
[SPEAKER_09]: eighties, you know, where they're,
Alar is approved to use on apple crops and
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, they're, you know, on orchards
and they're huge apples and they're all
[SPEAKER_09]: going to baby food.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this EPA report came out in like
1988.
[SPEAKER_09]: 87 or 88 detailing the carcinogenic
properties of dimenoside and how it broke
[SPEAKER_09]: down into a chemical called UDMH,
which is the hydrazine family,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is even more toxic, like a rocket
fuel derivative compound.
[SPEAKER_09]: And from that point on, it was banned for
use on any consumable crops since,
[SPEAKER_09]: but then it was like really popular.
[SPEAKER_09]: You used, you know, in the, you know,
late nineties through kind of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, a lot of the two thousands by
various types of growers, growers going OG
[SPEAKER_09]: Kush, you know, stretch your kind of
plants and in indoor environments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it really popular.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, among cannabis, but now it's a
category one pesticide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anything detected at the detection
limit or above, which is about 30 part per
[SPEAKER_09]: billion point zero three is a fail,
you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've seen the, the, the,
the fail rates of it on cannabis go down
[SPEAKER_09]: incredibly low, you know, below way below
1%, you know, so that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, but the fact that e-juice and
the fact that cigarettes are showing such
[SPEAKER_09]: consistent amounts of dimenoside across
all the crop is really blowing my mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that, that's, that's,
and then, cause then, cause we're testing
[SPEAKER_09]: these e-pens and there's like 15 part per
million of lead and there's like 2000
[SPEAKER_09]: times a fail limit for dimenoside on
California test.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, what just came out with this week
with, you know, there's approximately 20
[SPEAKER_15]: to 25 people now with actual breathing
issues due to illegal cartridges that have
[SPEAKER_15]: never been tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually product that would never,
as people would know, would never even go
[SPEAKER_15]: to testing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they even send it to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they backward backyard blasted and,
or very professionally blasted.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's very professional illegal setups
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's causing breathing problems to where
people can't, you know, basic oxygen
[SPEAKER_15]: transformation is a fucking problem right
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a problem people.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a huge, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole thing, you know,
with all these comas, everything like
[SPEAKER_09]: it's, it's really fascinating time that
this is all this breakout of vape related
[SPEAKER_09]: issues are popping up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, what is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it coming from the vape or e-juices?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it coming partially from cannabis and
the contaminants that are in it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably a combination, but it's
caused by prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what's so massive about this
whole story.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it really that much more,
um, you know, kind of, I guess intensifies
[SPEAKER_09]: the need for analytical testing and these
minimum quality standards to hit for
[SPEAKER_09]: public health and safety concerns.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because whenever you have all the legacy
toxic material from California that is,
[SPEAKER_09]: and other States that are then,
you know, being filled in carts and sent
[SPEAKER_09]: to the East coast without any regard to
people's health or safety.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're literally getting the dirtiest
stuff that's there that can't hit the
[SPEAKER_09]: market in any of the regulated spaces.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like, this is, I was just
going to say there's, there's people who
[SPEAKER_12]: are pirating packaging of like the more
successful, legitimate brands in
[SPEAKER_12]: established markets like Colorado and
California.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now that people other, people
unsworthy people can buy this packaging.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they can basically rip that packaging
off and put some sub quality product into
[SPEAKER_12]: what a consumer might think is,
Oh, that's coming from that vape company
[SPEAKER_12]: in California.
[SPEAKER_12]: When actually it's not, it's just coming
from someone who bought the packaging that
[SPEAKER_12]: from the company who's, who's ripping off
that company.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Hey, just while I have the floor,
just for clarification issues,
[SPEAKER_12]: cause I saw this come up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Arsenic is not a metal, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: But arsenate is a component that's been
used for, for many years in pressure
[SPEAKER_12]: treated lumber and a lot of that pressure
treated lumber that was made like in the
[SPEAKER_12]: fifties, sixties and seventies,
you know, that green lumber for picnic
[SPEAKER_12]: tables and swing sets and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of that lumber is now coming out of
service, coming out of useful service.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ending up in landfills.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and when that, yeah, when that,
well, wherever it goes, our arsenate
[SPEAKER_12]: itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not arsenic, the material arsenic,
it's actually arsenate, which is a S I
[SPEAKER_12]: think oh five or something like that,
highly mobile in groundwater.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that just, um, again, points to
again, human impact that a lot of places
[SPEAKER_12]: like Florida, for example, where there's
been a lot of development.
[SPEAKER_12]: On the coast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe that there's a natural
source for arsenic in Florida,
[SPEAKER_12]: but over the last several years and all
the development that goes on on the
[SPEAKER_12]: coastline and marshy areas require what
pressure treated lumber to go into those,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, sensitive wetland areas where,
you know, like what would typically be put
[SPEAKER_12]: into a pier or, you know, any wood that
has to go into a salt water exposure has
[SPEAKER_12]: to be super, super loaded with all kinds
of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see kind of like the green salts
that come spewing out of these.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for a long time, that was something
called CCA, which is chromated copper
[SPEAKER_12]: arsenate CCA, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this complex was used to make,
you know, telephone poles and railroad
[SPEAKER_12]: ties.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've seen that pressure treated
lumber, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So that lumber, which again is part of
like, you know, coastal development,
[SPEAKER_12]: say around state like Florida,
which is about to get hit by a huge
[SPEAKER_12]: fucking hurricane, um, has basically
imported all of this arsenic into their,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, water system.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and, and so again, there is no
natural source of arsenic in Florida and
[SPEAKER_12]: all the development that's gone on over
the last 70 years or so around the Florida
[SPEAKER_12]: coastline has imported all this arsenic.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so as this lumber comes out of use,
it definitely puts arsenic arsenate in the
[SPEAKER_12]: soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of nothing we could do about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like, this is just the,
the, the price that we pay for using
[SPEAKER_12]: chromated copper arsenic from,
I think I was discovered by some Indian
[SPEAKER_12]: dude in like the thirties and then AT&T
bought the patent and that green lumber
[SPEAKER_12]: was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that green lumber actually replaced
in some cases, creosote, which was used to
[SPEAKER_12]: treat railroad ties and telephone poles.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that black tarry shit that's
cancerous as hell.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um, you know, you're trading one
poison for another, but that's just,
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to mention that about
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_12]: So in, in areas like California or other
areas where wood treatment was used and,
[SPEAKER_12]: and arsenic was used as part of that wood
treatment, as that wood comes out of
[SPEAKER_12]: useful service.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It ends up getting leached into the,
into the water system.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't help it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just remind the panel that I have
been posting questions from the chat room
[SPEAKER_14]: into our own private chat room here on,
um, zoom.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you open it, you'll see there's some
questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, uh, some people are a little bit
more, uh, intense about getting their
[SPEAKER_14]: questions answered than others.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Mark, what was that question about
CBD?
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple, couple questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the, I seem to have lost it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The question was multi soil zone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no, no, it was before that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the first one was CBD production.
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard CBD production can be altered in
distillate by lengthening, decarbing times
[SPEAKER_14]: and THC can be converted to CBD in this
process.
[SPEAKER_14]: How true is this?
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the first question.
[SPEAKER_14]: I posted that an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And THC can be converted into CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what they say?
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, but that's what he's wanted.
[SPEAKER_13]: The question Mark is version of CBD into
THC via isomerization during distillation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's, that's, that's contra
thermodynamic, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So THC is lower energy.
[SPEAKER_12]: If given the opportunity, CBD will,
will convert over to THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a, that's a well-documented
fact by Raphael Mishulam himself.
[SPEAKER_14]: He had this the other way around.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was asking if THC can be converted to
CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I suspect he was confused.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, not, not, I think some people
are trying that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there was a, um, a guy who had that
idea, who posted for some input on one of
[SPEAKER_12]: the Facebook cannabis chat rooms were not
chat rooms, but groups where we sometimes
[SPEAKER_12]: talk about these things.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, it's, it's going,
you have to, you have to figure out a way
[SPEAKER_12]: to put, it's going to take energy to do
that, but it's going to take a particular
[SPEAKER_12]: catalyst to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, believe me, if you can figure out
a way to do that, that's very,
[SPEAKER_12]: very valuable because certainly people
want to take hot CBD and turn it into,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, all CBD and take away the THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what a lot of people are doing
with their, um, so when you're doing hemp
[SPEAKER_12]: extraction and you're getting a,
a CBD isolate from it, the isolate comes
[SPEAKER_12]: from the crystallization, uh, from a
mother liquor.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that mother liquor still is enriched
with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in most cases, depending on what
you're extracting, um, you can get
[SPEAKER_12]: multiple crops of CBD crystal from a
single mother liquor, but when it no
[SPEAKER_12]: longer, when you've robbed it of all the
CBD that it can basically, uh,
[SPEAKER_12]: you can get like the, now the mother
liquor is beyond the
[SPEAKER_12]: no more CBD have a THC and other minor
cannabinoid enriched mixture that I
[SPEAKER_12]: believe a lot of people are converting
over to CBN because CBN has incredible
[SPEAKER_12]: market value right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're making it into something that's
not THC cool, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're basically destroying it,
but you're destroying it into something
[SPEAKER_12]: that you can actually sell.
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, if you think about it,
if you look at the economics, it's
[SPEAKER_12]: actually a, a production process to make
CBN that by the way, makes a little bit of
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD along the way, because you'll make a
lot more money on your CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can cannabis pick up gold?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you brought it in near Sutter's
mill and near the Sacramento area,
[SPEAKER_06]: will it pick up gold?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an interesting experiment that was
going to cost a lot of money to figure
[SPEAKER_12]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so what you need to do is you
need to do my panning for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my wife.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has been shown to pick up the heavier
metals, but I don't know if the,
[SPEAKER_13]: if gold would, cause you'd, you'd have to
have some, I would go back to have a
[SPEAKER_12]: soluble version of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and to solubilize gold,
to solubilize gold, you're taking nice
[SPEAKER_12]: expensive gold and you're dissolving it.
[SPEAKER_12]: With hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid to
make some kind of gold solution.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fungi that exudates something that can
solubilize the gold in the raw.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then have that fungi then absorb it
and translocate it into the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's going to be, that's going to be
a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll say that's going to be a project that
I don't think is going to be well accepted
[SPEAKER_13]: because of the genetic engineering
involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark, I'd love to kind of jump in on a
part of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thought of the pressure treated wood,
you know, one of the, another really,
[SPEAKER_09]: really fascinating trends that we've kind
of seen since the beginning of last year,
[SPEAKER_09]: with regard to a couple of different
pesticides is, you know, one of them is
[SPEAKER_09]: called chloridine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chloridine is a, it was an old kind of DDT
like compound that has been banned for use
[SPEAKER_09]: on anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: They used to spray that around.
[SPEAKER_12]: They used to spray that in the trench
around foundations when they built homes.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a bad ass fucking insecticide that
lasts for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got like a hundred year half life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so they also used to pressure
treat wood with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we see in drying spaces,
if you're drying in kind of like say a
[SPEAKER_09]: barn or some space where there's open,
um, foundational wood where it was
[SPEAKER_09]: pressure treated, we're seeing the off
gassing of that pesticide happen to where
[SPEAKER_09]: we're seeing these traits.
[SPEAKER_12]: What levels are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like PPM or PPB or what?
[SPEAKER_09]: PPB mainly, but you know, with,
with chloridine, since it's also a
[SPEAKER_09]: category one pesticide, anything at or
above the detection limit of about 30 part
[SPEAKER_09]: per billion fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: But so, so we're seeing kind of right
around there showing up in flower that's
[SPEAKER_09]: basically being dried in these spaces.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and then, and then, um, in extract,
we're seeing it kind of showing up in
[SPEAKER_09]: failing amounts, you know, kind of about,
you know, maybe a couple, few hundred part
[SPEAKER_09]: per billion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but, but it's a trend that we've seen
and, and, and we've begun to also,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, kind of w I mean, whether it's
just a certain trend, but we've seen,
[SPEAKER_09]: we've, we, you know, a lot of these
chloridine fails, we're seeing very kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of regionally happen also areas like
Watsonville, um, and you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: berries and strawberries and all the
things that are, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_09]: and, and, you know, so there's a,
you know, whether it was the foundational
[SPEAKER_09]: wood in greenhouses, you know,
that are kind of open and exposed in the
[SPEAKER_09]: space that are off gassing when
temperature and humidity kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: differentials are happening or whether
it's in drying spaces.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause then on the, on the other side with
drying spaces, you know, um, one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: biggest fails trends that we've seen with
indoor cultivation is around, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: basically the use of aerosol bug bombs,
you know, cause historically people were
[SPEAKER_09]: taking these total release bombs,
like attain, which is bifenthenol,
[SPEAKER_09]: piperonol, butyroxide, um, uh,
pylon TR, which is chlorophenopure,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, per clue, I think it's on a Duraplex,
which is chlorophen, uh, chloropyrifos,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is an organophosphate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and then, you know, pyrethrum bombs
and there's, others, but essentially,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, people would take these bombs
that are meant intended for 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_09]: foot greenhouse spaces.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and they wouldn't, you know,
even organic people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I, you know, before we opened a
bestie labs, I was working many years in
[SPEAKER_09]: the hydroponic industry and, you know,
kind of essentially selling bombs and
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticide options to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, trying to train people to
be on a more organic integrated pest
[SPEAKER_09]: management and prevention approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but, you know, kind of be the others
that may, you know, everybody would use
[SPEAKER_09]: these bombs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so even organic people that would
claim to never spray pesticides or do
[SPEAKER_09]: anything negative with the plant,
they would still in between harvesting and
[SPEAKER_09]: indoor room, they would take a thousand
square foot room.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would light off a 10,000 square foot
bomb, you know, for any one of these
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticide bombs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And essentially they're lighting off in
this indoor environment where it then
[SPEAKER_09]: coats every surface area inside the space,
whether it's drywall, sheetrock,
[SPEAKER_09]: and just sucks in like port, like a
sponge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so essentially, whenever you do that
harvest after harvest after harvest,
[SPEAKER_09]: year after year after year, you know,
there becomes this persistence buildup of
[SPEAKER_09]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: That are then unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're seeing years after their last
use, we're like, particularly for the CH
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds, like chloropentapurine,
chloropyrifose, both category one,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, pylon most particularly because
it was so ubiquitous and available just
[SPEAKER_09]: over the counter in hydro stores that
people like, and so, so we will be failing
[SPEAKER_09]: like years after it's and, and then we're
helping in all this environmental
[SPEAKER_09]: assessment work further, like how the F is
this here?
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't used this in two and a half
years or a year and a half, whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so we'll then, we'll send out like
swabs and we'll take chunks of drywall
[SPEAKER_09]: that we'll then run testing on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've seen like 10 part per million
built up in drywall in, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: certain really worst case scenarios.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in those cases, we're seeing the
flowers, you know, that like even whenever
[SPEAKER_09]: they're grown fully organic, you know,
and this has happened when people have
[SPEAKER_09]: even just purchased an indoor,
like an existing LA indoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: warehouse grow and, you know, where it was
previously bombed on forever, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: now kind of, even though they're growing
all organic, you know, all living soil or
[SPEAKER_09]: predatory bugs, we, we, you know,
the first harvest out of this facility,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're seeing like 700 part per billion 0.7
in the flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then whenever it's turned into
extract, we're seeing over, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: two plus part per million in it,
you know, and this is again, like it's
[SPEAKER_12]: this buildup kind of taking place from
these, these part per billion
[SPEAKER_12]: determinations you're doing on the,
on the mass spec, right on the mass
[SPEAKER_12]: spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would take it right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you need, you need the sensitivity of
the mass spectrometer to be able to do,
[SPEAKER_12]: again, I think this is before you joined
today, Alec, we were talking about that,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, there's this NIST library of all
different kinds of compounds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you could basically match the mass
spectrum of what you think is
[SPEAKER_12]: chloropyrifos to know that that is
chloropyrifos.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's no question about it that that
peak and that material at that PPF PPB
[SPEAKER_12]: level.
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, the sensitivity of the mass
spectrometer is such that, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: you are down at the, at the PPB level.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got news for you folks.
[SPEAKER_12]: We live in a fucking contaminated world.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you start looking at everything that
humans come in contact with at the part
[SPEAKER_12]: per billion level, you'll be amazed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always used to say it's like taking a
little bus to a New York city sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to find everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to find all kinds of shit
that you never knew on food, on your
[SPEAKER_12]: clothing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you look at the part per billion
level, think about it just for a second.
[SPEAKER_12]: What a, so you have percentage,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you have per tens and then per
hundreds per thousand.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is billion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Part one part per billion.
[SPEAKER_12]: So imagine a whole rail car, full of vodka
and one little shot of vermouth.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like a part fucking for per
billion.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's an incredible, you know,
again, opportunity that we have to use
[SPEAKER_12]: analytical chemistry to look at such
levels at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: But really, I mean, if you were looking to
go look at some backwards smokes or just
[SPEAKER_12]: get, go buy some produce from whole foods.
[SPEAKER_12]: Would they hold up to this part per
billion scrutiny that you're looking at?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, will we see any residuals at the
part per billion level of stuff that's,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, in current commerce?
[SPEAKER_12]: So are they artificially holding cannabis
to a new level of purity?
[SPEAKER_12]: When we live in a fucking contaminated
world and the plant we love sucks up
[SPEAKER_12]: everything from the, from the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't beat them, join them in the
poisoning of this supply chain too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alex, I know this is going to be a big
case for you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: When, you know, edible producers down in
California, they have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_13]: all of their ingredients in their supply
chain are going to pass the certified
[SPEAKER_13]: testing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in a way, the plant trolls the industry
again because it's making all of our
[SPEAKER_13]: ingredients better for our consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love your thought on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, but it actually adds a caveat
because you saw probably this week too
[SPEAKER_15]: Alec of the study regarding how chocolate
actually affects the potent testing
[SPEAKER_15]: regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're finding even food products
actually can throw off testing altogether.
[SPEAKER_15]: So another aspect that we're learning as
we're dealing with more normalized
[SPEAKER_15]: products in from the food chain coming
into the ring of our testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, two points on that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Etienne on yours, which is 100% valid.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, we've been doing
analytical chemistry on cannabis now for
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 years and it has taken us about that
long to figure this plan out and all the
[SPEAKER_09]: different matrices that are presented with
infused cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So chocolate, gummy bears, gummy bears are
like the bane of my existence,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, to resolve a gummy bear matrix
and then pull the two and a half
[SPEAKER_09]: milligrams and accurately repeatably be
able to test over time kind of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the catchers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys use catchers, don't you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, different for different steps.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, catchers we used to use on our
pesticide prep.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we use it on our gummy
prep, but that's if that if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: recommending that, I'm definitely going to
bring it to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So are you doing like, are you freezing
the gummy with liquid nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you doing to macerate it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is a bit of a tangent because
I wanted to kind of hit back on this other
[SPEAKER_09]: side with kind of is testing kind of a
cannabis too much to Mark's point.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, you know, we've worked
through all these different matrices,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, kind of, and a lot of,
you know, whenever you start working with
[SPEAKER_09]: a manufacturer that's, you know,
kind of making infused products,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, such a big part of the job of a
lab that we bring to the table is to do a
[SPEAKER_09]: bunch of upfront testing for one,
to be able to, you know, demonstrate and
[SPEAKER_09]: prove our worth and being able to
accurately and repeatably test this
[SPEAKER_09]: particular type of product, whether it's
chocolate or gummy, you know, but then
[SPEAKER_09]: beyond that, it's us helping to identify
all these pain points in the other
[SPEAKER_09]: ingredient supply chain that are going
into this cannabis formulation,
[SPEAKER_09]: because we're seeing all kinds of trends,
you know, with like people making orange,
[SPEAKER_09]: mint, you know, where they're taking
orange essential oil and then making a
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis infused mint with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're, we're finding that
chloropyrifos is, you know, one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: most common organophosphates sprayed on
citrus.
[SPEAKER_09]: So of course, the essential oil of that is
going to have an ultra concentration.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you take the tiniest amount of
that ingredient and flavor your mints and
[SPEAKER_09]: you just failed the entire batch,
you know, and, and this goes to chocolate
[SPEAKER_09]: also.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chocolate is a known bio accumulator.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of a vital mediator of cadmium.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and we've engaged with like many
experts in the cacao industry since we've
[SPEAKER_09]: seen this issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause we know with the percentage of cacao
35%, 47%, 75 plus percent cacao,
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll see a linear increase in cadmium,
like up to multiple part per million in
[SPEAKER_09]: various sources of cacao with the
percentage increase in cacao.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so come to find out whenever,
whenever cacao is grown in mouth,
[SPEAKER_09]: in this regions of the world, like the
Andes, it's always going to have this
[SPEAKER_09]: known issue of, of cadmium bio
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, so the cacao industry had to pivot
whenever they were trying to meet these
[SPEAKER_09]: European Union standards that are really,
really strict on metals in the product and
[SPEAKER_09]: in the final form product that are being
sold to the European Union markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they've had to identify this whole
kind of issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as an industry, they came to find out
that it's whenever you're growing cacao
[SPEAKER_09]: and mountainous regions like the Andes,
this is, cadmium is always an issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: But whenever you're being, you're sourcing
it from other areas like Africa and kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of the, you know, central, central America
and such, then, you know, the cadmium is
[SPEAKER_09]: no longer an issue, but it's, it's,
you know, the cannabis regulation in these
[SPEAKER_09]: ways, it's, it's putting people up to the
highest kind of, you know, robust quality
[SPEAKER_09]: standards that anything's ever had to be
applied to.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, and there's landmines every
which direction around us, Mark,
[SPEAKER_09]: because of what your point is,
because we've toxified the environment,
[SPEAKER_09]: the legacy of the green revolution has
destroyed the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like contaminated everything,
but is that the answer we just,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, kind of just sink to that low,
or we set the new, the new high standard
[SPEAKER_09]: that, that eventually anything else that
we're going to be consuming should meet,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, cause it's like, I mean,
are these, you know, I mean, just with
[SPEAKER_09]: like, I don't know, I could just go off on
the glyphosate thing, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_09]: I've say it kills the microbiome,
you know, it gives the, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: creates leaky gut, which then creates all
the food allergies, which creates all the
[SPEAKER_09]: autoimmune reactions that, you know,
kind of then create autoimmune conditions,
[SPEAKER_09]: all the cancer, you know, so much of all
the illness and suffering that humans are
[SPEAKER_09]: now suffering from, you know, in so many
ways stems from this chemical revolution
[SPEAKER_09]: that has now created this completely
ubiquitous part per billion, part per
[SPEAKER_09]: trillion level of every contaminant and
PFOA, PFOS in the environment now in our
[SPEAKER_09]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but, you know, from what we're seeing
in California, one of the largest
[SPEAKER_09]: agricultural States in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, kind of even with the most
robust pesticide, heavy metal,
[SPEAKER_09]: mycotoxin, aspergillus standards that have
ever been applied, you know, across each
[SPEAKER_09]: of these categories, we don't see that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so pesticides, we see about two to
3% fail rate metals.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see about 3% fail rate microbial
impurities.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that yeast and mold and total aerobic
bacteria aren't the focus of regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just the pathogenic aspergillus
salmonella and E.
[SPEAKER_09]: coli species we see.
[SPEAKER_09]: About 2% or less fail rate across all
products, you know, and so, and,
[SPEAKER_09]: and, and, and I'll wrap the point with
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mean just be all sesquipedalian
with it, but essentially whenever,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, back, back in 2015 to 2017,
we weren't testing for 66 of the most
[SPEAKER_09]: common agricultural pesticides that are in
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're testing for 12 of the most common
pesticides, things like Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, myclobutanol, biphenazate,
abamectin, Paclo, dimenozide, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: spearmethicin, imidacloprid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're testing for these really common
ones that were used on cannabis and in
[SPEAKER_09]: flower 2015 to 2017 for these 12
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we're testing them, we're seeing
them in way higher part per billion,
[SPEAKER_09]: if not part per million at levels,
you know, with our old kind of mass spec
[SPEAKER_09]: systems, they weren't nearly as sensitive
as our new.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and so even then, whenever there was
no regulations and people were just doing
[SPEAKER_09]: the damn thing, you know, we saw in flower
about 30% fail rate for one of these 12
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when it came to extracts,
we saw anywhere from 50 to 75% fail rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And 50% was more like butane extracts and
CO2, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then when you've got more refined
distillate, it went up to 75% fail rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now across, now that California put this
minimum level of quality standards in
[SPEAKER_09]: place that everybody, whether David or
Goliath have to hit just to get product to
[SPEAKER_09]: market.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen pretty much most, for all
compliance testing, we've seen all these
[SPEAKER_09]: failures go down to less than 2%,
less than 3%, you know, for pesticides,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and that's across, you know,
concentrates and flowers, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: we see obviously a much higher fail rate
on the R&D and process testing end,
[SPEAKER_09]: as people are screening their supply chain
and ingredients before they get their
[SPEAKER_09]: product for market.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but, but that's like, that's,
that's mind blowing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Alec, can I ask, like, can you tell,
well, obviously, if the levels,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure would make sense, but can you
distinguish someone who's directly
[SPEAKER_12]: applying these pesticides versus a drift,
you know, result that would, that would,
[SPEAKER_12]: so you could cut, you basically see the
people who fail up here and then the
[SPEAKER_12]: people who fail down here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is drift and these are the people
who are applying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because I mean, with, with,
we'll see certain trends where across
[SPEAKER_09]: every batch in their, in the, in,
you know, of, you know, in a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_09]: everything will fail, you know,
that we can trace back to a clone that was
[SPEAKER_09]: dipped or, or maybe in the early spray
where they thought they'd be able to kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of get away with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the residual wasn't going to be as
long versus, you know, in a lot of cases
[SPEAKER_09]: when we're testing, you know, kind of
these major greenhouses and different ag
[SPEAKER_09]: areas, you know, we're seeing kind of more
regional pesticide kind of exposure,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, that are real close to vents
that, you know, that are, where air is
[SPEAKER_09]: being pulled in from outside, you know,
where it happened, we're seeing kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: more, you know, kind of, you know,
kind of less systemic or I guess across
[SPEAKER_09]: the entirety of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And more regionally kind of located.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then we'll go in and send out swabs
and we'll swab the interiors, exteriors of
[SPEAKER_09]: the greenhouse, you know, in different
perimeters of the greenhouse so that we
[SPEAKER_09]: can help to further narrow down because
the pesticide thing is a huge issue,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, cause the, you know,
the, the FIFRA, you know, the federal
[SPEAKER_09]: insecticide, you know, fungicide
rodenticide act, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, it's, it's the foundation at
which, you know, we are in the,
[SPEAKER_09]: in the world are protected from the
exposure of a lot of these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really stipulated strongly on
when you can spray, what can spray,
[SPEAKER_09]: how you can spray, you know, under what
conditions, when conditions, but those
[SPEAKER_09]: things aren't followed, you know,
and so therefore kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: when you see, when you drive down
California, you see people just midday
[SPEAKER_09]: bombing, kind of carpet dusting out of
planes or helicopters, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're doing so in full, willful
disregard to these regulations,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no guidelines for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm talking about them spraying ag
crops though, because now there's their ag
[SPEAKER_09]: sprays are going to drift in a effective
cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now that the cannabis farm gets hit
and fails a batch of this really high
[SPEAKER_09]: priced commodity crop, that's now legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they have a precedent for holding
account, holding accountable the farms
[SPEAKER_09]: because farmers have crop insurance,
not if they're, they lose their crop
[SPEAKER_09]: because they fucked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in case their, their practices over
spray and drift, and now they get held
[SPEAKER_09]: liable and have to basically get sued and
money basically is there from crop
[SPEAKER_09]: insurance to, you know, so it's,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to prevent over spray though,
from being causing a lot liability,
[SPEAKER_13]: especially in, in agricultural areas where
it's, it's a tradition or, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: agricultural spray predates cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's unfortunate, but what we're
going to see is in, in the cannabis farm
[SPEAKER_13]: choose to grow in those areas that
unfortunately have that over spray.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to have to develop SOPs
in the extraction lab to scavenge those
[SPEAKER_13]: sides out.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but, but just one, just, and I'm sorry
to keep, keep talking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you all been following the crop
protection services issue in Carpinteria
[SPEAKER_09]: with the avocado farmers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so this is revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this, I think proves the point to Mike
with kind of just cannabis changing ag,
[SPEAKER_09]: because you know, now that, you know,
so in, in avocado country, most avocado
[SPEAKER_09]: farmers don't spray their own pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: They hire crop protection services,
the biggest retailer, wholesaler of
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking ag chemicals, who also has a
department division that goes out and
[SPEAKER_09]: sprays the pesticides for a yearly fee.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also crop protection services as a
result of cannabis now being planted all
[SPEAKER_09]: around Carpinteria where the, where,
you know, in so many areas of Santa
[SPEAKER_09]: Barbara County, where the avocados are,
they now are scared shitless of getting
[SPEAKER_09]: sued and held liable for, for their
spraying practices.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just, they just pulled out of
every contract with every avocado farm to
[SPEAKER_09]: not spray pesticides this year as a result
of like, you know, the potential of being
[SPEAKER_09]: held liable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now instead of them just pulling up
their like blasters within the midday,
[SPEAKER_09]: without care of who's living in their
environment or what, how their overspray
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to affect people, the way you
used to get a blast and then drive home,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, now they're pulling,
not doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now if the avocado farmers want to
spray their own pesticides, they spray
[SPEAKER_09]: them and now they're the ones that are
going to be held liable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I feel like this plant is this,
you know, beacon of progress being
[SPEAKER_09]: planted.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rather than spraying the dangerous
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_13]: That aren't approved for cannabis,
they're going to start spraying the
[SPEAKER_13]: avocado plants with more beneficial
insects, beneficial micro bacteria.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of those are going to be able to
treat the same symptoms, just have less
[SPEAKER_13]: latency time and less hazard in the
community.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's cannabis forcing progress.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and that's great, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Same, same, same.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I've seen a lot of wheat farmers,
corn farmers and soybean farmers are now
[SPEAKER_13]: rotating hemp in.
[SPEAKER_13]: A, because they think they're going to get
that extra bonus, you know, a little bit
[SPEAKER_13]: more growing hemp than wheat or corn or
soybeans, especially with this trade war
[SPEAKER_13]: going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that, you know, I think the bigger
benefit is growing, growing polycultures
[SPEAKER_13]: and then, you know, being able to,
you know, rotate your paddocks,
[SPEAKER_13]: rotate your fields with multiple crops and
incorporate, you know, hemp's benefit for
[SPEAKER_13]: its herbicide.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you don't have to use those herbicides.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex, do you test for no test,
no pest strips?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, we've, we've seen people fail for,
for putting up the dichlorvos like little
[SPEAKER_09]: insecticide traps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you know, you can get the sticky
traps, which are chill, or you could get
[SPEAKER_09]: the ones that actually off gas pesticide
and that, and dichlorvos is a DD,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, DDVP dichlorvos is a category
one pesticide.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and also dichlorvos breaks down into
NaLiD or I'm sorry, maybe NaLiD,
[SPEAKER_09]: NaLiD breaks down NaLiD, which is an
organophosphate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because I don't know that many people
that use bomb, poison bombs indoors under
[SPEAKER_06]: lights, but those fucking no pest strips,
fucking I know hundreds of people that do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it's basically, you know,
cause in areas where we see those no pest
[SPEAKER_09]: strips that are basically gassing
dichlorvos.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's more or less the same thing,
just a different way of bombing,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause they'll spread out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Aren't pyrethrum, aren't pyrethrum bombs
used to like, uh, deal with sick infested
[SPEAKER_12]: rooms?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Py bombs, the bifenthrin bombs,
chlorofentapyr bombs, chloropyrifos bombs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see all of them used.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, and it's been really big
cowpox in California, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: before the testing regs were in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, for what it's worth though,
uh, pyrethrin and bifenthrin.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see kind of, I guess let, you know,
they, they, they seem to break down
[SPEAKER_09]: quicker over time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but, but a lot of these other
compounds, like the piper and I'll be
[SPEAKER_09]: chalk side, which is, you know,
company, um, that that's similar to the
[SPEAKER_09]: chloropyrifos and chloropentapyr is seems
to stay persistent.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, some of the only ways to
get it out once you've been just
[SPEAKER_09]: historically bombing is to rip down your
drywall, to rebuild the whole room,
[SPEAKER_09]: to like, because, cause what happens is
the lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_09]: The humidity spikes in the time where the
dehumidifier is trying to catch up and
[SPEAKER_09]: bring the humidity down.
[SPEAKER_09]: And essentially it just sweats from the
walls and from the environment,
[SPEAKER_09]: the ceilings, these pesticides out in the,
in the humid air, and then it just gets
[SPEAKER_09]: circulated and blown around through the
humidity ventilation systems in the HVAC
[SPEAKER_09]: and the DU.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you got essentially sticky
residue of these pesticides spread through
[SPEAKER_09]: every area of the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, and the thing is,
is it happens the same with those no
[SPEAKER_09]: strip, um, the little no pest strip.
[SPEAKER_09]: With nail it, depending on how many of
them you have spread across your room,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, you, it just, this slow gassing
or this one time bombing, it just starts
[SPEAKER_09]: to build persistence in the space.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the whole notion about using
pyrethrum though, is that pyrethrum
[SPEAKER_12]: actually is not stable and will break down
with time.
[SPEAKER_12]: So pyrethrum itself is an extract from a
chrysanthemum daisy, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: That is actually a natural insecticide.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you have to distinguish that.
[SPEAKER_12]: From pyrethroids, which are kind of like
there's opiate and opioids.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the pyrethroids are all synthetic
analogs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are all the active ingredients
that you're talking about, which yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: are not regulated for use in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: But pyrethrum itself is a naturally
occurring, you know, basically extract
[SPEAKER_12]: that has mostly insecticidal activity,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you can get pyganic and like an
organic evergreen version, which are just
[SPEAKER_09]: chrysanthemum extracts, extracts,
but you know, paper, which shows that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis can produce.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that I have to call.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, you know, there was there,
I think there was a very premature badly,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, whenever, so there was a paper
that kind of put out about pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, and correct me if I'm wrong Sam,
but there was a pretty recent paper over
[SPEAKER_09]: the last few years, but there was,
there was, I, there was some faulty
[SPEAKER_09]: information that was generated by a lab or
two around these.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause probably, you know, in, in the mass
spectrum, you know, like you can,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can pretty easily, if you don't
validate your run, you can misidentify
[SPEAKER_09]: pyrethrin or pyrethrin, you know,
these pyrethrin peaks or, or, or,
[SPEAKER_09]: or, or molecular kind of weights or
whatever, you know, what I'm less kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: scientists more kind of, um, on,
you know, kind of front end.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not foundational in a lot of
science, but essentially there was a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of false.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the plant had the materials to
produce.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I, so I, I do, I, I hear you on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know that because I know that the lab
was publishing data around it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know as a result, there was a
genetic testing company that published it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just, I would personally want to
see a lot more reproducible data to
[SPEAKER_09]: demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause from what I know, so much of that
was some was false positives from the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was only one variety of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that'd be interesting if there was a
certain specific plant or chemo bar that
[SPEAKER_09]: had that property.
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell everybody what it was, but
everybody out there will immediately get
[SPEAKER_06]: it since they're warned off of the no pest
scripts now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've already patented that,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Alec, um, I am definitely no longer
going to be hitting my Andean Cusco
[SPEAKER_14]: chocolate that was left on my pillow in
Columbia when I was there recently.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, dude, test it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Send it cadmium.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, let me test it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll send it your way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause once he just wants to eat it,
it's really small.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Cusco chocolate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and it's not to, it's not to
denigrate kind of, you know, then I love a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of Andean medicines, you know,
um, but, but to understand this topic of
[SPEAKER_09]: cacao and this whole, uh, fighter
remediation of cadmium, it's really blown
[SPEAKER_09]: my mind around these various aspects.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, just like the whole thing
with Juul and testing diamond azide when I
[SPEAKER_09]: was puffing, you know, once you know,
and you see the, see the results in front
[SPEAKER_09]: of you, you then have a choice,
you know, to keep puffing it or to keep
[SPEAKER_09]: eating that cacao or, you know,
to find a cleaner source.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's one of the most magical
things about kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: what analytical chemistry is bringing to
the, you know, science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really helping to kind of bring these
things to the surface that are unknown
[SPEAKER_09]: invisibles and then giving us the
opportunity to choose.
[SPEAKER_14]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's, it's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad you were able to make it in
because, uh, it sure was a lot of,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, analytical and lab talk before you
came in.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, uh, since you've come in as
well, it's been the real, and,
[SPEAKER_14]: oh, and I wanted to mention to you guys,
um, I am now I through zoom, I can record
[SPEAKER_14]: this.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I record it like in a video format.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it also streams to YouTube and gets
saved, but then it also creates a audio
[SPEAKER_14]: file.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've started to post at buzz sprout and
I'll post the link in hash church.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically buzzsprout.com backslash.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the code for all the hash church
will be five, five, two one nine six.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll post that in, um, I'll post it in
the comment section of all the hash
[SPEAKER_14]: churches from now on that are zoom.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll also post it in the hash church
forum on Facebook, just so people,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, some people have been asking me
for years to make a hash church into a
[SPEAKER_14]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a podcast and today it was a darn
good one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell you, I say we still got 22
minutes to rock till noon.
[SPEAKER_14]: I sort of had till noon put aside.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's, uh, let's continue our
conversation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't been seeing too many people
hitting bomb reps.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I've been hitting mine pretty
tough here, but, uh, maybe I have a,
[SPEAKER_14]: sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well,
[SPEAKER_12]: thanks for doing this, Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to get together with everybody
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to talk to Alec and see AT&T
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think AT&T just celebrated a big
milestone.
[SPEAKER_12]: In his life, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: A few, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: More than one just banged out a couple in
the last, like three months, but thanks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for putting this back together,
man.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: I must say it's, uh, it's nice to be back
on and to see everybody as well as to,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, learn.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love listening and hearing, you know,
uh, from everyone, you know, I just,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, what are you the big 50 now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I may, I became 50 and I got married
in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_15]: So half a century.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm in the half century club and
looking forward to the next one.
[SPEAKER_15]: So did you hear what he said at yet?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he's, he's been with his wife for 50
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, Sam, many blessings there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope to be, I hope to reach that
milestone myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: With my beautiful life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do the math.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you, Sam, the picture you have
hanging near your bathroom and your,
[SPEAKER_14]: and your kitchen there of like you and
your, your friends and you and Diana are
[SPEAKER_14]: in the picture.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like an album cover or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's definitely the front page of your
book because that is the most
[SPEAKER_14]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like it's like a Hollywood thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it doesn't even look real.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a much cuter one when I was about
nine months old naked on a, on a bear rug.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you've got to bury that in the book
deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't, uh, you can't be putting that
on the front cover, Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_12]: You get, uh, Hey, Mark, you want to answer
this last question here?
[SPEAKER_14]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_12]: The, is it possible to carboxylate?
[SPEAKER_14]: Converting it back into THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_14]: He would very much like you to ask that
question.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So who asked that question?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that question, you know,
oh, they probably tell me if I asked.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell us who asked it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's, it's possible, but it takes a
whole lot of energy because you've,
[SPEAKER_12]: you've basically THC again has got higher
energy than THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when it decarboxylates,
it goes downhill kind of like a roller
[SPEAKER_12]: coaster.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you need to put a lot of energy
back in and can you, so when you lose the
[SPEAKER_12]: carboxylic acid in THC, that's a
decarboxylation to carboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very old chemical reaction called
the Colby Schmidt reaction.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Colby Schmidt reaction is a,
it's a way to make salicylic acid from
[SPEAKER_12]: phenol.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a way of carboxylating phenol to
make salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can apply that to make THC,
but it would probably tear up the rest of
[SPEAKER_12]: the molecule because that reaction has
done it ungodly high pressure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think in molten sodium or some shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So middle of the sun kind of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're saying it's going to destroy the
turps.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to destroy everything,
including probably the person doing it,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, but someone reported the person
doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone reported the use of a,
a reagent called MNNP, which is magnesium
[SPEAKER_12]: mono terephthalate to do the oxidation of
THC to make THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: They only did a few milligrams in the
paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: They just showed that it could be done.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think isolated the peak in the GC
and said, look, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that was blue Ford focus who asked
that question.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he just said, this is so much better
than asking on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he's getting the poop.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, probably not.
[SPEAKER_12]: And once you decarboxylate, you know,
it's a, it's a downhill thermodynamic
[SPEAKER_12]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_12]: You lose CO2 and that CO2 needs a whole
lot of energy to go back and be the
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid acid again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when they used to make industrially
salicylic acid, salicylic acid,
[SPEAKER_12]: you could actually isolate from,
um, from the bark of willow tree,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think is where they used to get it from,
but you can make it industrially in a
[SPEAKER_12]: Colby Schmidt reaction.
[SPEAKER_12]: Colby is spelled, um, K O L B E Colby
Schmidt, man, these are some bad-ass
[SPEAKER_12]: German chemists for, you know,
a little after turn of the century that
[SPEAKER_12]: were fucking taking molten sodium and
doing all kinds of synthesis with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: These motherfuckers, man, it just,
you know, this is the foundation of
[SPEAKER_12]: chemistry that exists out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's, there are ways.
[SPEAKER_12]: So to answer the question, yes,
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would tear up the rest of the
molecule.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would never be economically
viable to do so.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, but interesting question
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's inspired me actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just mentioned it to the YouTube
chat room that, uh, I think a really good
[SPEAKER_14]: episode would be, you know, a question and
answer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, listen, listen, this is going to be
the panel this week.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're specifically only going to be
answering your questions, maybe even over
[SPEAKER_14]: the course of a week.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or two, you know, bring in 500 different
questions and pick like 20 or 30 or 40 or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have time to answer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we could answer five questions
every time we do a hash church.
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, you know, just today being the last
half an hour, it made sense to just be
[SPEAKER_14]: like, they've got lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing I will say about the,
uh, chat, uh, the hash room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, hash church chat room is that they're
very, um, engaged with what's going on for
[SPEAKER_14]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_14]: The odd times someone gets a stick up
their ass and they try to like hijack the
[SPEAKER_14]: entire conversation, but they are pretty
damn engaged in the conversation,
[SPEAKER_14]: which I guess is a part of the,
that little bit of magic that we have.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would they be watching if they were?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you'd be surprised, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go into like, like, you know,
okay, for a perfect example, couch tour.
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you ever, you get to go to the real
show.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you probably don't have to do couch
tour, Mark, but let me tell my couch tour
[SPEAKER_12]: now because fish is out in Denver caliber
of people in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just say are not 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, for the rest of us, layman,
what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just talking about sometimes fish does
a live, they do their tour video live
[SPEAKER_14]: streamed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they have a video stream.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes it's on you stream or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they have a chat room,
just like us, just like here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'll go into the chat room
thinking, man, I bet you there's some good
[SPEAKER_14]: people in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's like troll central in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you don't even want to go in there
for half a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything here is really engaged and
really thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of crazy questions in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going through trying to find,
there's a few that are really fascinating
[SPEAKER_09]: around testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of the ones actually I see
on here that real quick, I think would be
[SPEAKER_09]: great to hit is, um, pesticides through,
um, why, why do pesticides kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: concentrate more with the central oils and
the red in the resin glands, then kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: on the biomass or plant material.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, cause we, we see that trend very
specifically, like if you, if you have
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides, uh, fungicides, anything like
that on the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and if you do fresh frozen extraction,
live resin extraction on it, and then,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, in the process of further kind of
purifying and kind of mining the diamonds
[SPEAKER_09]: where the, then the terpene separate up to
the top, you know, in the terpene layer,
[SPEAKER_09]: like if you test the, the crystalline THCA
that's created from that process,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, it's 96, 97 plus percent THCA.
[SPEAKER_09]: The remaining bits are, um, you know,
presence of kind of terpenes, what have
[SPEAKER_09]: you, but you see in the terpenes,
um, the terpene layer is where,
[SPEAKER_09]: what, what fractions the pesticides with
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we see most all of the pesticides or
whatever that, uh, whatever fungicide
[SPEAKER_09]: contamination that's in the material,
we see all of that migrate with the
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that because the terpenes are of
solvent?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's kind of.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was kind of.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hygrophobic solvent.
[SPEAKER_12]: And most of those are hydrophobic
molecules.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of them delivered by a suspension in
water.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not very water soluble,
so they want to be in a hydrophobic
[SPEAKER_12]: environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it totally makes sense.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm bummed, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be great if the, if the pests,
well, you know, that said there are water
[SPEAKER_12]: soluble pesticides that will stay in the
water and not go into the oil,
[SPEAKER_12]: but unfortunately, most of these,
you know, insecticides and Michael
[SPEAKER_12]: butanil, a lot of these things are,
are very hydrophobic and will concentrate
[SPEAKER_12]: in the oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys missed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The second I mentioned that we had a good
chat room, a troll came in and was like,
[SPEAKER_14]: you guys need to stop smoking weed and get
your, get your lives together.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's what I was missing.
[SPEAKER_15]: My life.
Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_15]: What the heck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if he would just tell me exactly
what I should do, when I should do it and
[SPEAKER_06]: how I should do it, I'll follow his rules
to see how it works out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to finish it with a bong rep.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got 12 minutes left before it's noon.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got all these tasty bootlegs and my DAT
recorder from like, I bought this in 1995
[SPEAKER_14]: in Missoula, Montana.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just decided, you know what?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to become a taper.
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be a fucking taper.
[SPEAKER_14]: 95.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been to quite a few shows.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been to a bunch of shows already.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had a hard time acquiring them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was, how did you find that in
Missoula?
[SPEAKER_14]: How did I, I know, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: How did I, what Mark?
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just, you said you'd been to a bunch
of shows, dead shows or fish shows?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was fish shows.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think to be honest, Jerry had been,
had passed already by this point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw fish for the first time in 93,
but yeah, I just have all these old shows
[SPEAKER_14]: from like, you know, here's a David
Grisman that I taped, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like all of the ones I have, Marcus are
taped either the Milky way or the
[SPEAKER_06]: Paradiso.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I know Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yours are amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the Missoula Montana show.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was the first recording I ever did on
this DAT.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an incredible show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there's tracks from that show that are
on the alive one.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're live release.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the tweezer from that night might
be the tweezer.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that was from Bangor, Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was at that show.
[SPEAKER_12]: See, look at that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you know that was in 94 in Bangor,
Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I took too many psychedelics at that
show.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I thought it was just like,
okay, the guy's like, do you want to eat
[SPEAKER_14]: some mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, I would love to eat some
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, they're pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, well, just give me a gram.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I eat a gram of these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, apparently pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm standing in line to get into this
concert and the sound of everyone talking
[SPEAKER_14]: slowly morphs into mechanical,
like crazy, like spaceship sounds of like
[SPEAKER_14]: a giant spaceship gearing up to take off.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was totally blowing my mind.
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point, I thought this shit must've
been dipped in a much stronger psychedelic
[SPEAKER_14]: because like no gram of mushrooms could
get me this high.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've eaten enough five gram doses to know
this is going to be heavy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm getting high.
[SPEAKER_14]: The lineup's getting closer and closer.
[SPEAKER_14]: As we get to the door, I realize they are
searching people harshly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's like all these cops lined up
against the wall and there's patent people
[SPEAKER_14]: down.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I have a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I started stuffing every thing into my
socks and I don't really realize it,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I basically stuff my bag of weed into
my sock and it gets caught up on my pant
[SPEAKER_14]: leg.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really just sticking out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Out of my pant leg.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_14]: I go up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: They pat me down and don't see this
plastic bag, apparently sticking out of
[SPEAKER_14]: my, my pant leg.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I walk by this like long row.
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I'm like, I'm, I'm in a
psychedelic state.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even exactly tell.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like everything's different than it should
be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And these cops are all just looking at me
with the most serious look.
[SPEAKER_14]: And man, I walked past them about 20 feet
and looked down and realized the bag was
[SPEAKER_14]: hanging out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was the beginning of a very
intense, uh, show and that 29 or 31 minute
[SPEAKER_14]: long tweezer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mind numbing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I, I had, I was hassled by going
into the Palace theater on my birthday.
[SPEAKER_12]: This would have been December 29th,
1992.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just got back from Colorado and I
had, I, we were growing skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had a nice fresh, uh, bag of skunk
number one in my pocket and got it taken
[SPEAKER_12]: away going into the show that night.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really just bummed me out because it's
just such good weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, on the way out of the show,
we grabbed the bag out of the garbage can
[SPEAKER_12]: where they made me through the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we got a bunch of shit that was
confiscated at the tour that night and ran
[SPEAKER_12]: around the back of the theater.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're back there, Marcus and page
walks out page from the band walks down
[SPEAKER_12]: the stairs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're all down there going through
our, you know, what we got, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: one man gathers with another man spill.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got like a bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got a bag of mushrooms, got everything
that was confiscated at the door that
[SPEAKER_12]: night.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got, because we grabbed the trash in
the theater.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to dial that up to this year,
I was going to see fish.
[SPEAKER_12]: At, um, we were going in with my family at
Maryweather post pavilion and the young
[SPEAKER_12]: kid told me to empty my pockets.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I just, I pulled into my
pocket and I had, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, a couple of pre rolls, you know,
inside a raw, you know, the raw cone
[SPEAKER_12]: cardboard thing that they have a couple of
the, I just had one of those with like two
[SPEAKER_12]: J's in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, he pointed to the trash
can.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, in the trash, I'm like,
are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, in the trash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he had some other older dude behind
him with a walkie talkie and I wasn't
[SPEAKER_12]: going to be held down for two joints
walking into a fish show.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I, we threw it in the trash and then my
son was just in on the other side.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, dad, you got, he's like,
no, I got him taken away.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, dad, what the fuck man?
[SPEAKER_12]: So we went to the show and on the way out
of the show, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we walked through the same exit there
on the garbage can is the thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We grabbed that shit and fucking took off
with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you work a job where you're searching
people on the way into a concert and
[SPEAKER_14]: you're not letting them take their weed or
hash or cannabis products into said
[SPEAKER_14]: concert, you, my friends are a dick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially at a place like, you know,
where, you know, cannabis laws are
[SPEAKER_12]: changing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's got a vape pen these days.
[SPEAKER_12]: You figure, oh, this guy's just got two
pre-rolled joints and a fucking rock,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, thing, you know, let them go in,
you know, it's like, no, they got to take
[SPEAKER_12]: it away.
[SPEAKER_12]: They feel like they're doing their job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the cool thing is I went back out
through the thing, grabbed them and there
[SPEAKER_12]: they were.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's very cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of like being told you can't
smoke at a reggae show.
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck is that, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_14]: We absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to a pop festival in England.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called the Redding Pop Festival in
1971.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they, it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget what it was, you know,
20 bucks or 30 bucks at the time to go for
[SPEAKER_06]: a couple of day festival.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I noticed what they were doing is
they were taking everybody's ticket,
[SPEAKER_06]: tearing it in half, giving half to the
person.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other half they were throwing in the
trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when nobody was looking, I took about a
thousand of them out of the trash and I
[SPEAKER_06]: just started handing them out to everybody
that didn't have tickets.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny ticket seed.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an OG ticket.
[SPEAKER_14]: Call him Muriel.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's some serious miracles distribution.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, think about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Most people like can say like,
I gave a miracle away.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I personally have an 18 person
miracle story, but Sam's got like,
[SPEAKER_14]: well, I gave away like, I don't know,
it was like 800 miracles or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well played, Sam.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_12]: I need a miracle every day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had something I was going to say,
but I kind of spaced it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I did the hashtag song the other day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I listened to it the other day.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to say, I, Marcus, you know what I
do is like update the lyrics, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well then I want to go through it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I sang it the other day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, it made me think about Horatio
and Tony and Nikki, you know, like all the
[SPEAKER_12]: people that we used to be on, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen Horatio literally since he
came.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, one time I bumped into Horatio.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise he's like on the down low.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: What about Indra?
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you heard from him at all?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, from who?
[SPEAKER_12]: Indra?
[SPEAKER_12]: Indra, John.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I talked to Indra.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I have, I'm in, I'm in, uh,
I haven't talked to him in the last,
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe a couple of weeks, but I talked to
him more often than not, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how is his extractor or extraction
business going?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is there anything to report that you
can report on?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's a lot of work for sure,
but there's, he's definitely got something
[SPEAKER_14]: really quite amazing there as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're hoping on, uh, you know,
getting it going in a way that,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, can even be more amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's definitely, there's no doubt
about, you know, what he said in the early
[SPEAKER_14]: days, you know, that he had created this
fairly special thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a, it's a pretty special thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's definitely producing product in
the seed oil and protein world for us that
[SPEAKER_14]: we're quite happy about.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a matter of R and D at this
point.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Indra will be back on again, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what about Tony?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the latest on him?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: I still am in a company with him,
but as far as I've heard, I really don't
[SPEAKER_14]: know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I heard he won a cannabis cup
recently.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I know that you can still rocking and
rolling.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure he's probably down in California
running his lab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you go to you can site that I
don't think he's, he's, uh, he's part of
[SPEAKER_12]: the team anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like he's no longer with you
can, is that right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I just, I, I was wondering about
Tony the other day and I just,
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to you can site and I see it talks
about earning and, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_12]: other folks, but it doesn't, I don't think
Tony's mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not legally part of, uh, you can
anymore, but what he is is, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: he still has some shares in some of the
companies that he needs to, he's promised
[SPEAKER_06]: he was going to sell back, but it hasn't
happened yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, shares, we all know how that plays
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember at one point you can had $11
shares and then I checked the other day,
[SPEAKER_14]: it was 49 cents.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's gotta be a wicked hit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just tough to play that game.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and I don't know, like,
if you look at some of these other bigger
[SPEAKER_12]: players, like the multinationals now and
the canopies and, and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what's going to ultimately happen
in that, you know, especially with the FDA
[SPEAKER_12]: is positioned now on, on, on CBD,
you know, so a lot of Canadian,
[SPEAKER_12]: huge Canadian companies are, are scooping
up licenses left and right here in the
[SPEAKER_12]: States.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll be interesting to see where this
goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: More people make more money selling shares
of their companies, pump them up and dump
[SPEAKER_06]: them, then selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_14]: Massive, massive, uh, insane amounts of,
uh, of wealth have been, uh, produced in
[SPEAKER_14]: that very fraud, I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a trip to me because, you know,
there's so many, I mean, there's so,
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like just in the cannabis,
in the, like the, the leadership of the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis community in each of the spaces,
each of the States, you know, there,
[SPEAKER_09]: there lies this kind of, you know,
this two degree of Kevin Bacon kind of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, of the connection and
interconnection, I think of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_09]: leaders in the community, you know,
and, and I think there's massive strength
[SPEAKER_09]: and kind of the solidarity among that
community.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, their cannabis is so long been
based on trust and, and respect and kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of integrity in your word, you know,
like, you know, kind of hustling weed,
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of somebody could rip you off to rob
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's this code of conduct,
I think that's really kind of fallen off,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, in this invasion effort of
capitalism into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I really pray and hope,
you know, on this task church today that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we as a community can kind of
come together more and less see each other
[SPEAKER_09]: in ways as competition and kind of more,
you know, really, you know, cause it's,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the real competitors haven't came
in yet, you know, obviously, and,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're waiting for the infighting and
all the failures, you know, because the
[SPEAKER_09]: lack of capital or the, you know,
kind of the, the vulture fund kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: effort to come just take over and kind of,
you know, transform these good ideas and
[SPEAKER_09]: good people's business into, you know,
these pumping up shit efforts to kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: just raise money and capital with quick
exit strategies.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I feel like, you know,
us, us understanding that there's,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's more kind of culture and richness
in our community than we could ever,
[SPEAKER_09]: than they could ever bring money into to
take over.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as long as we can gather and,
and, and organize in that way,
[SPEAKER_09]: and, you know, kind of keep that code of
conduct on that high level of integrity,
[SPEAKER_09]: then I think we can also, you know,
in a way, all kind of all boats rise with
[SPEAKER_09]: the, with the tide, you know, and,
and we can come up while, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: they make their efforts.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think a lot of those efforts are
going to fall short and get a fail,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, deploying that much capital to
scale cannabis businesses across so many
[SPEAKER_09]: states and so many places.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's so hard to grow fire herb
and, and to do so with hubris thinking
[SPEAKER_09]: you're just going to monocrop it bigger
than you've ever gone without even ever
[SPEAKER_09]: having to go through the understanding and
issues of all the pests and all,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, it's, it's a futile futile
effort.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, again, ultimately the plants
control us and you know, the people with
[SPEAKER_09]: integrity that have taken care of it will
ultimately come up as long as we,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, are able to stay resilient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that said, I want to offer universal
shares in my company, universal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise everybody they'll go up to a
million dollars each.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, you just sold 8 billion shares.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a quarter right here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 25 mil Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got an eighth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, history doesn't not only
repeat itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: History rhymes, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're think about the end of alcohol
provision, the eve of the end of alcohol
[SPEAKER_12]: provision in, in the U S right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they realized that provision
wasn't going to work anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it became a regulated medicinal
and all that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_12]: But ultimately look what it washed up to
now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, yeah, there's Budweiser and
there's these huge manufacturers of all
[SPEAKER_12]: this swill crappy product, but there's
this great, incredible craft beer industry
[SPEAKER_12]: and craft distiller industry that will
come along with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think as long as there's a consumer for
it and as long as there's enthusiasts like
[SPEAKER_12]: us and the people who watch hash church,
I mean, certainly like, yeah, just think
[SPEAKER_12]: of it like tomato.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can grow your own tomatoes,
but you can go to the place and buy
[SPEAKER_12]: tomatoes and that place is regulated by
the department of health.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's got to be ISO certified,
blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, ultimately that's where we're
going.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be unregulated completely.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be like a craft beer
industry for the connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll always be good, high quality
artisan cannabis and cannabis products
[SPEAKER_12]: available, just like there are really
heady beers and it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_12]: To be like sort of geographically specific
to those areas, just like the heady beers
[SPEAKER_12]: from Pacific Northwest and Colorado and
the ones in Virginia and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just, it's a great analogy
and I think that's how things are going to
[SPEAKER_12]: roll out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I, I 100% agree there, Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really appreciate, I appreciate the,
I'm so much, I'm grateful to be part of
[SPEAKER_09]: this and, and just the level of thought
and, and understanding among all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: hash church elders, I'm really grateful to
even be part of this conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, one thought on that,
you know, I've been wrestling with this
[SPEAKER_09]: quite a bit, you know, with especially
this whole hemp movement and the
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation of make hemp great again,
you know, and the conversion of all these
[SPEAKER_09]: monocrop kind of, you know, super
contaminated spaces, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: now growing kind of CBD for human
consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately that could be found over the
counter, you know, by a, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of pediatric epilepsy patient,
you know, it's like, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and obviously I, what I'm about to say
too, I say so fully mindful that I have a
[SPEAKER_09]: vested interest in a testing laboratory,
but, but where I'm coming from and
[SPEAKER_09]: speaking from is, you know, passionate
servant to this plant and seeing,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the botany of desire,
the whole, this whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: co-evolution that's taking place,
you know, from us cultivating this plant
[SPEAKER_09]: and this plant ultimately cultivating us,
you know, I think a great purpose of this
[SPEAKER_09]: plant is really, you know, again,
this bioaccumulation story, it's to help
[SPEAKER_09]: bring to the surface, you know,
these invisible unknowns that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, are important for us to restore
human health and wellness, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: which cannabis is such a part of,
but food is even bigger a part of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's like, what percentage of
the food grown in America, what percentage
[SPEAKER_06]: of the people that eat the food eat
organic food?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wonder what, I understand that and,
and I, I 100% agree, but does that mean
[SPEAKER_09]: that those people aren't being poisoned?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when there's this whole,
I don't know, I think they are being
[SPEAKER_06]: poisoned, but my question is, I think that
we are a small market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I agree, but we have the chance with
this plant co-evolving us to radically
[SPEAKER_09]: affect and disrupt agriculture,
to begin a process, to make food medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: again, you know, whereas medicine does not
lead me to organic living and living soil
[SPEAKER_06]: and biodynamic organic growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a farmer like that before I grew
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just follow me though on this thought,
you know, cause this is the big,
[SPEAKER_09]: big kind of, you know, thought I've been
working on and in my mind and reconciling
[SPEAKER_09]: just, you know, in the service I'm working
on, on behalf of this plant now,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I feel like this plant's a
storyteller, you know, and through these
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations we've put on it, it's telling
the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great story about what's happened,
the legacy of what's happened to land,
[SPEAKER_09]: legacy of what's happened to our food
system, you know, the legacy of like
[SPEAKER_09]: helping to, you know, with all these
lawsuits in effect right now around
[SPEAKER_09]: Monsanto, like 12,000 lawsuits around
biophysically creating cancer in people's
[SPEAKER_09]: life.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's this moment of awakening
that's taking place and cannabis can help
[SPEAKER_09]: with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this Ayurvedic quote, when diet is
in order, medicine is of no need.
[SPEAKER_09]: When diet is out of order, medicine is of
no use.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you, no matter how much this medicinal
plant cannabis can help heal our body and
[SPEAKER_09]: our life and our pancreas, if we don't
first change our diet and radically remove
[SPEAKER_09]: the chemicals and the poisons that are
destroying our microbiome, that are
[SPEAKER_09]: creating the systemic inflammation,
that's creating all the illness,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, then, you know, what are we
doing on behalf of this plant?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all this place to innovate and
make money and, you know, what else is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's to help change the world,
you know, and part of that is to,
[SPEAKER_09]: through the transparency of what now,
you know, cause cannabis is the first crop
[SPEAKER_09]: that's ever been regulated on this level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every other ag crop has been fully
deregulated everything has been so
[SPEAKER_09]: deregulated to the point where our entire
food system is compromised and is
[SPEAKER_09]: poisoning us.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's poisoning our children, it's
poisoning our lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the people that are making the
pesticides are the same people selling the
[SPEAKER_09]: medicines through the pharmacy Bayer,
you know, that are then kind of like
[SPEAKER_09]: healing the ill, which is just this like
people being farmed, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: like from the poisons in the food to the,
like going to the doctor and taking the
[SPEAKER_09]: pharmacy that's been making them sicker.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's an endless cycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like with cannabis,
we're disrupting that, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're bringing this to the surface.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's helping to set an example of food and
change, but, and, and here's my last
[SPEAKER_09]: point, then this is the biggest thing I
was actually just trying to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I think we, we have to have
this eternal vigilance, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: as leadership and elders in the cannabis
community to uphold this minimum quality
[SPEAKER_09]: standard that have been put in place so
that we can kind of not only have a
[SPEAKER_09]: barrier of entry for like, you know,
the thousand million acres in the Midwest
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, the mega farms with the
super tractors are harvesting all the GMO
[SPEAKER_09]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like for them to just be able to
shift and grow CBD, but then ultimately is
[SPEAKER_09]: going to go to children or autistic people
and patients or any other person that's
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for cannabis to help them.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, if we don't uphold this minimum
level of quality and set the example for
[SPEAKER_09]: national conversations around legalization
and what anybody has to meet, if they want
[SPEAKER_09]: to participate in the drug market of
selling medicinal cannabis to people and
[SPEAKER_09]: patients through, you know, over big box
stores and whole foods.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, if we don't uphold and set the
example, you know, like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada went even stricter than California,
but there's this, there's this integrity,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think with the testing model that's
helping to not only hold any, any,
[SPEAKER_09]: and everybody accountable that wants to
come in and take their piece of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's also helping to create the path
for this radical revolution of agriculture
[SPEAKER_09]: and small farming kind of, you know,
back to, you know, and that's the rant and
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize, but I just wanted to- To have
a lot more faith in common sense and
[SPEAKER_06]: people's goodness than I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are incredibly clumsy and
stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't lose the hope, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't lose the hope.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I appreciate the perspective for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to do a few things quick because
we're over the 12 o'clock thing and I got
[SPEAKER_14]: to go here soon, but I needed to ask Sam
in regards to purchasing a screen out of
[SPEAKER_14]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember which one the 43T was in
micron?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 43s were very small, like the whole
size.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like 40, 50 micron or something,
or more like 70?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember if it was the thread
measurement per centimeter or inch or if,
[SPEAKER_06]: the person that asked is Rob because when
he did hashish, he wrote all that shit
[SPEAKER_06]: down and me, all the results I did,
I remembered that, you know, a 77 is what
[SPEAKER_06]: you wanted for collected resin and a 43 is
what you put on top of when you wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: get rid of everything that was too small
to be good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was probably a 70 micron.
[SPEAKER_14]: 43 is 70 and then the 77 is like 150 or
160 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also makes a difference whether it's an
S or a T or whatever that has to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: the thickness of the thread.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the thread diameter, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that determines the ratio of hole
versus the ratio of screen on the surface
[SPEAKER_14]: area.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, I believe it's lines, LPI,
lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the greater number, the greater threads
per either inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't use inches over here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's different.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have lines per inch and mesh are the
same, LPI and mesh are the same,
[SPEAKER_14]: but the T's and the S's, the 43s and the
77s from the UK is some other rando,
[SPEAKER_14]: super like, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: They use in Switzerland and the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to buy Swiss Neibolt and Swiss
Polymon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the ones that I used to use and
I used to use 77 either an S or a T and
[SPEAKER_06]: 43s.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I just wanted to get that off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I also wanted to say a shout out and
maybe a bong rip because this will
[SPEAKER_14]: probably be the last thing I say.
[SPEAKER_14]: To one of our long time, like since the
beginning of Hash Church, he was there in
[SPEAKER_14]: the chat room.
[SPEAKER_14]: He went by Apot Smoker and I guess he
passed away recently.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we thought we would give him a nice
little send off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for being a part of the Hash Church
community, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to see you go, but I guess we all
have an expiry date.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's puff a little bowl for Apot
Smoker.
[SPEAKER_14]: R-I-P, Apot Smoker.
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it sound better on Zoom as opposed to
the other one?
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to mute my mic.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's gone, right?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm doing the train ditch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I told you, what I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I told you, he's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I told you, he's gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks so much, Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the best ending to a great Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.
See you next time.
Bye.
