[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to bubble man's world guys I am so
happy to announce that out of those 20
[SPEAKER_00]: year old seeds that I cracked and I'll
give you a little Breakdown on how I did
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I better do you know I called
the great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked different friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a really good seed germinating
page and I haven't been able to refine it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to find it so I can link
it to one of the guys who asked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: other video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I just went my old school method
that I knew was tried and true a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: plates paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisten the paper towel and basically
covered it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this just like this under my office
table and I turned on my radiant heat
[SPEAKER_00]: floors just to about 75 degrees and so
underneath the plate is a nice kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: warm temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper towel has not moistened out and
the water isn't like super cold to touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about you know a little warmer than
room temperature 75 degrees or so and this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning I opened it up and had a seed
crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you a couple of macro
pictures that look how beautiful that is
[SPEAKER_00]: with the old outer shell cracking open in
this just perfectly beautiful new life
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done is I've already taken
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally just cracked with a tiny
little bit pointing out which you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: and I dug the little hole with a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pushed the pen into a tiny little
bit maybe about a geez you know not a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter of an inch or something and then I
dropped it in tip up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now in the the cocoa and the peat
moss and the the pro mix sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've moistened the pot and yeah I guess
we'll wait and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about nine more seeds that are
in here right now not to expose them to
[SPEAKER_00]: too much but none of these seem to have
the crack happening on them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to touch them with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing that one of those seeds
cracked and I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically just a short update that
I wanted to share with you letting you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the Jamaican hybrid of lamb's
bread Eugene strain is growing at
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubbleman's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be something fun to watch and
I'm just gonna leave you now with some
[SPEAKER_00]: photos from Jamaica that I took over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these photos are from the early
2000s but some of them are from a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more recent so a recent but basically
enjoy keep watching Bubbleman's world and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an additional thing to add guys when
you're cracking your seeds make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: light is extremely close to the top of
your container.
