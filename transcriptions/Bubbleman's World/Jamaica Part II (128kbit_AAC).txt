[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, just splitting the pad,
hitting Hope Road here, and we are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to make our way to Dubwise, but first
we're going to hit this little Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: restaurant of all places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Mexican restaurant here in
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check it out, and then we'll make our
way over to see our buddies there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Nomads at Dubwise with
Yardcore, so looking forward to that,
[SPEAKER_03]: looking forward to the Challa station,
and of course we brought the Taurus with
[SPEAKER_03]: the torch this time, and the Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be good, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so this is Chalitos, parking at
Owner's Risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chalitos.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Chalitos menu.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a really cool wall mural in the
back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be a nice room to set up a D-nail in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too shabby at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this place is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chalitos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys getting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll keep ordering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I ordered they had perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all worked out for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burritos and quesadillas were delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually didn't mind this hot pepper
sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we're going to head over to
Dubwise and get to the Challa station.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready there, Chalitos?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you even see me?

[SPEAKER_04]: It's over the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the inside of the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I turn the wrong way, I can burn the
muck out of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be like, eww, remember that's our
new purpose for that torch.
