[SPEAKER_04]: What's up D?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much buddy, what are you up to?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you're out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: How sound is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is the How Sound, part of the
Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, you got Bowen Island behind you
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got Vancouver Island way,
way off in the distance where Matt the
[SPEAKER_04]: Great Gardener is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We swam there last year, didn't we?
[SPEAKER_04]: We did, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there yesterday and did a little
video, showed everyone the backside of
[SPEAKER_04]: Boyer and I kind of went around,
saw Gold Eagle really briefly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, hey, take it easy on the mothership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time for rips?
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for rips, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet, well let me throw this camera on
the tripod.
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can come join ya.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to squeeze yourself over
one little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than perfect, in fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't do laps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed you found a little package
of rosin on the deck or something there,
[SPEAKER_06]: of the dock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, did I actually end up grabbing
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I threw it into my bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: look at that, it fell in the hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of freaking me out for a
second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I did bring some of my own as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in my little skillet tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bam!
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for this last night and I
could not find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just gave up looking for it and
knew I'd find it later, and here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone endlessly makes noises,
so I'm just gonna shut her down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think mine is in the bag,
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy Christ, what a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really nice out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got the torch, we got some
ragsins.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always happy to blaze a session,
even always more so happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: To do it out on the boat.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here buddy, go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch me up!
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see the mothership so clean,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're gonna have a pipe like this,
it should just be like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how beautiful and sparkly and
clean it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This port's swing is clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes for a nicer hit, in my opinion,
and it makes for me just a more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you a carb cap as well, or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little dirty.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason it's dirty is because I'm
not sure if I should torch that or clean
[SPEAKER_06]: it with iso, because I just don't know if
I'm gonna wreck it either way,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know I don't clean the cords
with any isos.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or any cleaners, you kind of burn it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoo!
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was feeling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was feeling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice taste on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just being able to sit out in
this weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you want me to torch out?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, being able to sit out in this
weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the sunshine, what is it, 9?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: on the house sound, doing bong rips out of
the mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just doing any kind of bong rips,
doing rosin rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we pressed up together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We pressed up together, and it's just
complete fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you do a big toke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're done, son.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fucking coughing and you're not
liking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we might just give that like,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give it a 5 count.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people do 45 seconds,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it to be too long for water hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's better for the oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: My hit tasted sublime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're gonna cruise around today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna show you guys around the house
sound a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna head over to Gambier Island
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna sit here and be baked for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right after this session, we're gonna
head over to Gambier Island, and we'll go
[SPEAKER_04]: have a session in Hawket Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess we'll feel it out,
see where we go from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether we want to go deeper into Gambier
and go into the West Bay or Center Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we can head over to Bowen Island and
actually go grab a veggie burger or a
[SPEAKER_04]: burger from this good little barbecue
place that's just right up by the boats
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll bring you guys along with us,
of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And careful of your torches.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got just burnt there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got a touch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And last night on the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lean over it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was trying to reach up and I heard
it just sizzle longer than it normally
[SPEAKER_06]: does.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it got me good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I put some of that Horatio's oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put some of that on top of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it instantly stopped burning and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it actually helped out a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fully activated, so it makes sense
that it would, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I do feel two bong wraps are
in order.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we do two back to back?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready for a Hawket Bay session,
but you could hit another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because, you know, it's just one of
those days.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a beautiful morning and I just feel
like a second is in order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you got to hit a second, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a point on hitting a monster my
first rip, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I didn't do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's okay, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you got to have another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the beautiful thing about cannabis
and how easy it is to titrate the dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply take a rip, suss it out,
feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need another one?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a group in the paper and
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so gooey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're in the sun and it's hot right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got another boat going by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real nice day to be out on the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are these rare moments that boat
people understand where you just,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, you get a moment like this out on
the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's almost nobody out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on the frigging ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's killer whales.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's sea lions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all sorts of epic wildlife right
swimming underneath us right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking total fucking system,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: A life system underneath us.
[SPEAKER_04]: One that could swallow up like that
island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the crazy thing about the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, we're at about 600 feet for
depth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sitting about 600 feet of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever dive down and see if you can hit
the bottom?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never dove down deeper than 145 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: 145, that's it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 145 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people narc out at about 100 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get the nitrogen narcosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went 285.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be done, and it involves different
sorts of things like decompressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, a deep dive was like 140,
145 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like, it's dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scarier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have as good of a visibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most people use their oxygen at such
an accelerated rate that if you go down to
[SPEAKER_04]: those depths, you really only have a few
minutes to stay down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're some super, you know,
if you're from Finland or Norway,
[SPEAKER_04]: they have cold waters there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those guys, they always preserve their
breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any diving that I've ever done around
the world, like in Thailand in warm
[SPEAKER_04]: waters, those guys will come up with 80%
of their tanks when everyone else has like
[SPEAKER_04]: 20% left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when I did diving in Mexico,
we did a 40 foot just on coral reef and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was such nice, calm, proper breathing
that I lasted down there longer than the
[SPEAKER_06]: instructor actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he went up and I was the last one on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, if you're from a cold area,
you will likely be able to preserve your
[SPEAKER_04]: breath more in warm waters than people
that are from those waters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess because it's cold for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like, yeah, they might get
down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is when you can hold your
breath and can control it in colder water,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will be able to use even less breath
in warmer water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the guys, when I was, I didn't want
to put the wetsuit on, I just dove in my
[SPEAKER_06]: shorts and they're like, you're not going
in a wetsuit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, it's cold in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, fuck as if.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll do this rip here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, dude, rip it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to drive to Hawket Bay on
Gambier Island right behind us,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is kind of cool that the boat has
twisted around now and it's showing us
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's showing us Gambier Island as well
as parts of the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, if it's nine o'clock and it's this
hot, it's probably going to be 30 degrees
[SPEAKER_04]: today Celsius.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a hundred degrees Fahrenheit?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super iry right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready to, uh, to get back in the,
uh, in the driver's seat soon and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, take a little spin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just ripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just fly in this boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, on a day like today,
it's safe to go fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, another thing you got to know about
the ocean is it's not a lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a lot more things to watch out
for out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deadheads being a huge, big ordeal,
big logs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they sink and they float just
below the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those ones you can't even see.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing you can do, but you can
keep your eye out for anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, uh, it's not the kind of boating
where you're, you're yammering away to
[SPEAKER_04]: your friends and looking away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like ocean riding is like you are white
knuckling and staring at where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not want to hit, hit a tree out
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at the forest that's
surrounding us on all these islands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those trees break.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come into the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: They float around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes trees break, uh, free from,
uh, the log jams that they tow up to the
[SPEAKER_04]: paper mill up the cell there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right, well, D and I are going to
chill out for a bit and just relax and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, we'll get going in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the morning buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really said it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've just crossed the house sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were over there and now we're over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we did sit for quite a while and
just enjoy the medication.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think both of us lean back, eyes closed,
smiling, relaxed, relaxed, enjoying the
[SPEAKER_06]: sun on the face and the beautiful mother
nature in front of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one nature at her best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it beautiful?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the backside of Gambier islands
and you know, all sorts of things to see
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, eagles, seals, sea lions,
uh, the dolphins are often seen around
[SPEAKER_04]: this island.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be really cool if we caught
some dolphins.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of those dead heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like the old chilele.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old chilele.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old Irish chilele.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm sure there's some good cliff
jumping up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see up there, there's a rope with
a little kind of climb down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ripping, ripping like five or six of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Having fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Bowen Island right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the ferry to the sunshine
coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, that ferry is halfway to
the sunshine coast right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could be on the sunshine coast in
probably less than half an hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could eat the ferry there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we could, although you'd be
surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going damn near 40 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the dog woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are, um, our Budis trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: The orange ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those trees what I know about our Budis
trees, and they have a different name down
[SPEAKER_04]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, our Budis trees, they lose their
bark in the winter, not their leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why they're so smooth throughout
the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They shed their bark.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a seal up ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably go down when we go by.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are otters as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, as you get closer to these
islands, you realize how majestic they are
[SPEAKER_04]: and how really big they are from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks beautiful, but it doesn't look
like this.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: those are Budis trees, as you can see grow
right out of rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: This little bonsai sticking out the front
here is pretty sick too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Juniper or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, also because it's the ocean
and they don't mark everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also leery to go too close to the
coast because it's, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be a rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not really anyone's job to say
that there's a rock there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the captain to be aware of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, apparently I'm the captain,
so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a bay in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Hawket Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three more bays over here,
which are, oh, something like Center Bay,
[SPEAKER_04]: West Bay, and I can't, Long Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's Long Bay, Center Bay,
and West Bay, as well as Hawket Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the three bays of Gambier on
this side.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of population on this island.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a fair amount of people living.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, nothing compared to Bowen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you definitely can see houses
and population in most of the bays.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably the quietest one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a peaceful place to live.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody helps out everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very community orientated probably and
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, I would think so for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sure a beautiful place, man,
I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they often make their ways into the
bays.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta be a little bit more careful on
the entrances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that could be, that could be
where people have buoys for their own
[SPEAKER_04]: boats or it could be, it could have been
where they did have a huge boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was in this one or Long
Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sunk it recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a big ship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some sort of like build the,
exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be neat to check out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's open this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bimini is so low.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, a hawkhead is a place where
people come usually with their boats to
[SPEAKER_04]: camp out and sleep in the bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there might only be a home or two
in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've camped out a few times on fishing
trips like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look at the bald eagle, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's sitting on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's sitting right on the rocks,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoying his morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably had a couple of fish already.
[SPEAKER_06]: He fed well.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's enjoying the morning, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hello, brother eagle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry that we, you know, made him leave,
but glad that we got to see him go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bald eagle's on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in Hawket Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of cool, cool little spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've brought you guys here one time before
with Flav.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a big Marcel octopus piece and we
had a session in the bay here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're going to turn off the
boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a little session.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just noticed a vessel pull up here
and it's some scuba divers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was pretty cool as we
were just talking about scuba diving a
[SPEAKER_04]: little while ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been sitting here for quite a while
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've blown into the bay and kind of
spaced out and even forgot where we were
[SPEAKER_04]: for a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: That eagle actually landed on the other
side of the water there and he's chilling
[SPEAKER_04]: out in the tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably got a full belly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too shaky.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm almost ready for a burger on
Bowen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that next.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will.
[SPEAKER_04]: All
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawket Bay session.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've only got about an hour of film time
on our battery.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to try and have a dab
in each spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show you a little bit about what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some Eagles or some seals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up is Bowen Island, but we hadn't had
a dab session here yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we figured we would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the carb cap up front,
so we won't use it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That really is, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a dab or you haven't already?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready to go.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to do a video soon where we
just go out on the boat and shred.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got all sorts of fun things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wakeskates, wakesurfs, wakeboards,
skis, tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a hydrofoil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have quite a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have a few of them in the sense that
I get a couple of my buddies up from
[SPEAKER_04]: Whistler who are ragers and really good on
those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be always the fun to see how.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big rip you're taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: D420K is not fucking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're really getting blown in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turning the boat around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing about the rosin, you can take
those big rips because it's so fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you really can.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so smooth and powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a tiny little boat, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trucking people back and forth on
this little dinghy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm diving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next stop, Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

[SPEAKER_07]: And they will mesmerize your eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: My people before you realize.

[SPEAKER_07]: Distress.
Distress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we've just pulled to the
inside of the first part of Bowen Island
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just came from around that corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a really cool house.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got solar power.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got wind generated power.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this particular property, he owns the
whole island.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been on a TV commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was for Land Rover,
if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can actually drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see where the canoe is, Darren?
[SPEAKER_04]: That little boat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's a road that he drives his
truck down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he drives it into a tunnel on
this rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Into a tunnel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Into a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a tunnel in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he comes up at his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah dude, check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right into the tunnel, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that part underwater at high tide?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That part is underwater at high tide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they showed it in the... That's like
right out of a Marvel comic book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back cave type shit.
That is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the back cave right there,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.

[SPEAKER_07]: In every mouth there lies to sound,

[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to listen to yourself and know
which one you must choose and which one
[SPEAKER_07]: you must use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get confused.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no,

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are just pulling into Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, Darren couldn't help himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: He needed a rip right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told him, I call this Rip Alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I didn't really tell him that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just now I'm saying, this is Rip
Alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rip Alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taken wonderful rips right where
you're sitting as the boat idles into
[SPEAKER_04]: dock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this where you burn your leg on your
stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to put my feet down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_07]: What
[SPEAKER_07]: a beautiful day, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love these little houses and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been on Bowen Island before,
Darren?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: First time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the D420K's Bowen Island cherry.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's one way to put it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I just jam the thing?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go into the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to wreck your camera if you
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hold it.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And steer with my teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll call.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready, Darren?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they'd like it,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's proper boating
etiquette.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think also that it might not be proper
boating etiquette.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: What nice little places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nothing over fancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, a nice little spot.
Look at that place right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to have the sprawling deck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So
[SPEAKER_04]: you will be jumping out of the boat right
where you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would start untying the rope that's on
the railing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be very good for you to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's not a big deal there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to even go back one spot
and try to come in to this spot right
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's big enough and I don't really
need to go in, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if I can park the boat OK,
Darren.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to upset me when I'm trying to
do this, OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just joking around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to hit that boat in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came in a little tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, a fine job would have been me
coming in on one hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just parking the boat.
Kill
[SPEAKER_05]: the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we've landed on Bowen
Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: The boat's tied up to the dock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go find a dab session or a food,
whatever comes first.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they call this snug cove.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this for a good reason?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is pretty snug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, Crow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the greenhouse is sick, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and his boat in front of his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's living a dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's living a dream that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beauty greenhouse too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it really looks after it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even dirty.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I would have way more food
growing in there, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cush.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all about that Cush about that Cush
about that Cush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Paradise Grill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best burger on the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys say we try some of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got veggie options?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven days a week, 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it already 11 a.m.?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's later because I always open
late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dr. Morgan's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to do half of the mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we managed to get burgers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty stoked on it, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good looking burgers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she seemed to do a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to try out the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairy came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: She changes the landscape up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, eat these burgers real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a nice little boardwalk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boardwalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reeds.
Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Davies Creek.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crippen Regional Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are trails, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dorman Point is two kilometers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Killarney Lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hike around the Killarney Lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep dogs out.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I found out today my favorite
sandwich place was open at 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just what you needed, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that's definitely where we're
heading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's head into the back of one of these
picnic table areas and just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which way?
[SPEAKER_06]: The trail goes over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go right here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we can somehow sit on the
side that you're not going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll be hitting dry rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't bring water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, there's water right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we won't be hitting dry rips,
so I'm going to go put some water in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bring the torch?
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't bring the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a biggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so D428K and I just came into
the... What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: The lemon pie?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the name of the place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lyman Moon Pie Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lyman Moon Pie Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our first years as famous people.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what did we get?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got that one there, the banana cream,
chocolate banana cream pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice draft.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're about to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chocolate banana cream pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to swim for a bit after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm quite excited about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the pie, Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate banana cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we made it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were here earlier, but we forgot the
torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we have the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we've got to get some water
into the mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some mothership here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't bring a water bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, there's a creek here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a darn near perfect right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'll do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go sit on the beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think it'll be a bit of a nicer session.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, D428K and I are on the lookout
for the ultimate chuff spot here on Bowen
[SPEAKER_04]: Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Darren was feeling this trail,
so we're going to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice big trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to go into the forest and do
a big loop around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't promise it'll be possible to get
to the water from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Dorman Point Trail,
so it goes in a circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: This left, if we go all the way around,
will come out right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to get down to that beach?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to walk two kilometers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just give it a small shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we walk the first little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's definitely up, up, up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it takes you to the beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless there's a beach trail, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a beach trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this, D.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bringing us in through the back way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice spot for a session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much right out to the log I pointed
to earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking this one over here in the
shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect, Darren.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: A great beauty spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just break the whole arm and hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you open it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, man, I'm pretty excited about this
little session we're about to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can point to wherever you want us to
sit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be right out in this sort of
little tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought some rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camera's way over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can't hear us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here on Bowen Island in Snug Cove.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had ourselves some impeccable
chocolate banana cream pie over at the
[SPEAKER_04]: lime pie company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, we had the veggie burger at
the Paradise Grill, also here on Bowen
[SPEAKER_04]: Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a meat burger.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a meat burger, a ham burger,
as they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meat burger.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to use a key for the
dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always nice to have a key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cut this right in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you start doing this with a key
and you realize that you don't really even
[SPEAKER_04]: need a dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a key is a dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a loud torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong, Darren?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to get away from the flames,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the wind, I can block it best right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really close, wasn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang it off the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wind really cools it down fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect temp dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me organize one for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I got a little bit of the
goodness on my shirt there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it roast up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the mustard on your shirt,
I got the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather have the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the rosin, I guess you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get me sorted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get you sorted, D420K.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take this off so you don't have to do the
close dab to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a close dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd wait a few seconds for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to cook that toke off too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get it adjusted.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's all pressed in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right into the shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beach Rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice little unit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice little spot for puffing on
mothership rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, well, we still have quite a few
stops to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to keep on keeping on
on the journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each time we stop, we share a bowl
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the queen of Capilano,
the Bowen Island Ferry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming in to let everyone off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're heading back down to the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time on Bowen with you, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: You too, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made it back to the vessel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to get everything ready and head to
Horseshoe Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there goes the ferry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take him out of Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace, Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy cold glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I do notice that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, stopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen that ferry before.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're a little feller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just got like a few cars on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting to sort of sit there in
the middle of the.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a wave.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to pay more attention because
all these boats coming out of here are
[SPEAKER_04]: like tourists from around the world
renting boats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not knowing fuck all about the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, of course, where the Bowen
Island and the Nanaimo, Vancouver Island
[SPEAKER_03]: and even ferries come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those three ferries come and dock right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ferry docks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's the yellow RCMP boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the RCMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Coast Guard vessel for helping
more than a thousand problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's a big boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a nice season here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, they're double boating up on
this dock over here, so it's full.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government dock that I would have
parked on looks probably pretty full over
[SPEAKER_01]: here, unless there's a little piece on it,
so I can grab more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can maybe go over to that one if the
water's not too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty low over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks like that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we just parked the boat on
the dock here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in Horseshoe Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have much battery left,
so we're just going to maybe go grab a
[SPEAKER_04]: gelato and have a rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and look, there's my mother ship.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get some of this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want him to play us a song.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Play a song?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man's World?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Bubble Man's World?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in Bubble Man's World,
we educate people about the wonderful uses
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis and the phyto-cannabinoids and
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's really a cannabis education
sort of site, yet we live a healthy
[SPEAKER_04]: lifestyle and show that while we're
educating about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I like the sound of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do a song.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a song for you, then.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: A bit of an off-the-beaten-path one that
you don't play when you're busking near a
[SPEAKER_08]: fountain, but since the cannabis culture,
you've got to be a little resistant to
[SPEAKER_08]: authority.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a piece called recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know the word recalcitrant,
the term?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: It means recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Resistant to authority.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a little bit of a heavier song for
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's Tory Amon Owen, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, Tory.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recalcitrant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pound it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give him thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've managed to pick ourselves up a
little Baskin-Robbins ice cream,
[SPEAKER_04]: D420K in the house with his rum raisin on
his phone, but he says hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, D?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing filming when I'm on the
phone?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing on the phone when we're
filming?
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know you were, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always filming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to share the times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I only have a minute left,
and I want to do at least a dab before we
[SPEAKER_04]: leave Horseshoe Bay, so we're going to mow
these, and we'll come back for a quick
[SPEAKER_04]: 60-second or less dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we found our spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like we're good to go, D.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, D420K with his Horseshoe Bay
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: West coast in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we got the other camera
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need that other fucking camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to show you this house up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty pimped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go a little bit faster to get
closer for the camera, because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have my video camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my big camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that fucking house, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is some sweetness right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really beautiful place, and then the road
goes all the way down to this other place
[SPEAKER_04]: that is also on the property.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you really can't tell how incredible
of a property it is from down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's got a helicopter pad.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of see it sticking out of the
trees there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bushes on the left of the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that big circular concrete pad?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty pimped out house, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, D, we made it to the backside
of Boyer Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like what I call my office.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's so close to home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just boot out here in a couple of
minutes, be out at this little spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost always calm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We swam here last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got yourself a rosin rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll let everyone know off camera that
I did manage to get my horseshoe bay dab
[SPEAKER_04]: in, but my camera died.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're using the Canon now to film with,
but we've left horseshoe bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my horseshoe bay dab was off camera
only.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can really see the color difference
over your left shoulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over your right shoulder, it's all
quite aquamarine green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice color in the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might have to jump in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was
[SPEAKER_06]: tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoying you for the rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy the bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dial me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have your little, uh, your carb cap
for this little unit?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use that, but it's in the case here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like that carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's meant for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's meant for it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the birds are making some fierce
noise back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eatin' something.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't know better, you could
literally convince someone that monkeys
[SPEAKER_04]: were back there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, with the noises, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: This rosin's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna look like a toke of that stuff
next, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, any time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Torch me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some nice boats out from the water here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got four or five decent looking crafts
all just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like these guys might get some
wake skating going or wake surfing or wake
[SPEAKER_05]: boarding.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the waking sports that you do while
you're awake.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like waking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the best part of waking up,
uh, folding?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me neither.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best part of waking up is rosin in
your bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or on your honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that rosin really just melted to
my... I'll let that cool down a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carb cap, ready to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boyer Island rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have carved that for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a dry hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a dry hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really smooth for a dry hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is rosin, it's true enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer water, but that was pretty damn
smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want that there?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how well this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good all day since super early in the
morning too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll probably be like this till eight or
nine or ten at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, give that like a 20 to 30 second
count before you drop that rosin in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll get what is like not really a
low temp dab, because that would be more
[SPEAKER_04]: like a 45 to 50 second count after you
torch it orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a 20 second count for rosin and for
full melt bubbles, I find, is super,
[SPEAKER_04]: super tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jet skis ripping by going like 60 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy is flying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tasty rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tasty rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm feeling hot enough here that I
just might have to go for a little swim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't bring towels of course,
but I'm pretty much over that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can air dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the end of that long ass boat ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna head back to home and this will be
the first of many boat videos for the
[SPEAKER_04]: summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if I'll do a longer one
than this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a long day out on the boat with
D420K.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've taken our last few dabs and we're
just pulling up to the marina now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for watching bubble man's
world and we will catch up with you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the road of life is so rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rugged, rugged and rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the load you carry is so heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
