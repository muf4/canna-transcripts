[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 156.
[SPEAKER_05]: My three-year anniversary, our three-year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even really believe that something
that started as a completely total spur of
[SPEAKER_05]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, spur of the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally been unbelievable having
all of you show up weekly in the chat
[SPEAKER_05]: rooms, having you all be a part of the
Hash Church group.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, all the panelists over the
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have tried to invite almost every
panelist that has ever shown up on Hash
[SPEAKER_05]: Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are unable to make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are going to make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we write this second,
send out the links.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll send out the email link.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will send out the Facebook links and
see what happens here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some people that are going to be
coming in early to say their congrats and
[SPEAKER_05]: give us a little bit of what they're up
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Etienne today is going to have a
hard time coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe he said he was at the game,
but yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: 123 people in the room already.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get this email sent out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get these other things sent out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on mute.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally did it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on there, right on cue this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I even got my bowl full of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I would like to thank you,
Johnny B., for coming and showing up damn
[SPEAKER_05]: near every episode that you were able to
hear for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've helped make it hilarious,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are already laughing about your
mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ever change, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're perfect the way you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: People love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being a part of our
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate you, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are a huge part of my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing how it grabs you and pulls
you in and welcomes you with full arms
[SPEAKER_11]: open.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we've done here with Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcoming everybody with full arms open.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just great to see three years
later.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe it, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we started doing Google's Hangout,
Tony and Darren are all just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all of a sudden, it's just like
it's erupted to such a mass education
[SPEAKER_11]: platform for around the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited to be here and excited for the
people to be able to be witnessing,
[SPEAKER_11]: I say this to be at Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like history.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's muted too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all done it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my headphones on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my mic sorted out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today I'm trying my best not to have
technical difficulties, which is sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe we should hit a bowl or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm game.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I came in and this is because of the rib
that's broken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got a seatbelt on?
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a seatbelt on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you just hit the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not even doing bong rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually it is like a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got several things going on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a little Sherlock.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the mothership.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the double bubbler.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm loaded up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got like four pipes already preloaded.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this way I couldn't miss a beat,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: For real.
[SPEAKER_05]: For real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunkman Sam, are you with us,
brother?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all muted out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: with the seatbelt and the hits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's funny to have all these people
text me this morning saying, I need to
[SPEAKER_05]: come in really early.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_15]: I realized that my mic was muted.
[SPEAKER_15]: So excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, Sam.
[SPEAKER_11]: You pulled a Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you're not allowed to start that
first thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You dabbed me out and I was like,
I'm done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's trippy not to have Etienne in the
room so early.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely missing you Etienne,
but I hope you're having a great time on
[SPEAKER_05]: our three year anniversary at the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know football is a great love of yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we support that and hope that you have
a good time out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: As it were, in the meantime, we got three
to four hours of rocking Hash Church
[SPEAKER_05]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a matter of making sure
everyone got that proper invite and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're able to make it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Donnie Worshafter was saying early
today that he had only a small amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: time to come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see if he's going to make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll send out the link, make sure
Tony and Natasha have the link as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to celebrate it with Hash and
coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, trying to get everyone the link sent
out was such a nightmare for me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I basically kept creating these huge mass
texts on Facebook and then I would go to
[SPEAKER_05]: send it and it would say, this person
cannot be reached now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I had to go through all 55 people
and send them a message that said test,
[SPEAKER_05]: testing to see if they're going to be able
to be reached.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the private message worked and
they all worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I had to go individually onto each
person's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was unfortunately, try to keep your
mic there muted, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything you move is super loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it ended up being Samantha Elvey.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you remember, Samantha Elvey had a rare
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: She had, her hands were affected and she
had sort of these mutations going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so she was the one person I wasn't
able to invite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely wanted to invite her,
but I guess her Facebook page is no
[SPEAKER_05]: longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we weren't able to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, welcome Donnie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Donnie Worshafter in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how you doing Donnie?
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a guest?
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Miguel Bifari.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is an expert in South American,
Central American drug policy.
[SPEAKER_10]: The two of us are in Cali, Columbia,
working on a project together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the project that Breeder Steve is
involved in?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not, but Columbia is opening up
for a lot of people to come and try to
[SPEAKER_10]: make their fortunes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've, I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Columbia, Central America,
South America, all of these countries that
[SPEAKER_05]: have been kept from prohibition,
much like our own countries are now going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to flourish and show,
you know, specific levels of, of,
[SPEAKER_05]: of expressions that maybe we have never
seen before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I'm, I look forward to all
these different countries, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: being welcomed into this cannabis
industry, because guaranteed Columbia is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to produce some very unique
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's, go ahead Mike.
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, I, I wanted to add that,
you know, there's differences between
[SPEAKER_24]: countries, like I'm Argentinian and we,
we have not suffered directly,
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, people being murdered,
like the war on drugs, like what has been
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_24]: We produce here in Columbia as a country
who produces, right?
[SPEAKER_24]: The rest of the country we don't produce,
we consume.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why they have this war for 50
years, right?
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds like somebody just walked on
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony just came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in Puerto Rico right now,
figuring out some deals there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Indra.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome Indra.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't seen you in a while either,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got Puerto Rico in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the house of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wade is in the house, Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to keep that mic muted a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had to mute your mic when you're
not talking, Donnie and welcome Tony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome Indra.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everyone's having a good day and
Dr. Natasha just hitting the room as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, that looks like a Puerto Rican fatty
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's puffing fatties.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing Natasha?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, we had a little bit of
reverberation through Donnie's mic,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Indra, Wade, Tony, Johnny B,
Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good little group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a very unique panel that has
never occurred here on Hash Church right
[SPEAKER_05]: now, this particular panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three year anniversary, 400 people
watching live right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we get a good 10,000 out of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly I just want to hear what people are
up to and what people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: out there doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to hear a little bit more of,
about what's going on in Cali in Columbia.
Donnie?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The government's still deciding what's
going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It isn't finished yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've published regs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're taking applications, but they're
still a little scared to move.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of changes need to take place.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've promised 40,000 farmers here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That they can continue to grow their crop
after the war.
[SPEAKER_10]: They owe this to the people as a war
reparation, but the government has no clue
[SPEAKER_10]: of how to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're here as technical
representatives, trying to help the
[SPEAKER_10]: government and trying to help the local
campesinos come to a solution here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what, what about the American
Columbian relationship?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they, are they good with Americans
right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Donnie, are you having a little bit of a
bit of a rough navigation with that?
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem at all here.
[SPEAKER_10]: They love people.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very extremely friendly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every, all my friends think I'm crazy to
be down here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's violent and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all I experienced here is love.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's quite something.
[SPEAKER_10]: To the point where we've decided one of
our projects here is to start a guest
[SPEAKER_10]: house.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have the museum guest house
in Toribio, Cauca.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are opening for business in
December.
[SPEAKER_10]: With a cannabis museum to educate tourists
and Columbians about their rich history
[SPEAKER_10]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, it's that re that really
reverberates and, and sounds very familiar
[SPEAKER_05]: to me in the sense I had a lot of people
tell me the same thing about Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can't go to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's a violent, dangerous place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's full of like beautifully kind,
compassionate, and empathetic human beings
[SPEAKER_05]: that I just seem to find around every
corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time we have president Trump
and his henchmen threatening Columbia
[SPEAKER_10]: right now, threatening to take away their
trade status.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he certified them in among nations
because of this stance to try to find a
[SPEAKER_10]: new solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: The 40 year multi trillion dollar drug war
has not worked and everyone here
[SPEAKER_10]: understands that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a, you know, it's, it's
definitely the situation that's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got, uh, I mean, did you hear what
they just announced recently in regards to
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you think it's, they're,
they're calling out everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just announced from NORAD that,
uh, if, if, if a missile was sent to
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada via North Korea, that America would
not defend us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they made that statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what kind of a statement is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're, we're, don't say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It, everything's, everything's a mess
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, keep our heads down, keep focusing
on this healing plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: This, you know, we've heard it in enough
reggae songs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the healing of the nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually believe that it's the healing
of the nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believed it when Martin Moravchik told
us when we started growing hemp in
[SPEAKER_05]: Manitoba, this is going to change the way
people think just by seeing it on the side
[SPEAKER_05]: of the road.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be the harbinger of
peace here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is necessary.
[SPEAKER_10]: To bring peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to make these people have
prosperity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this crop is the key to making that
happen here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the government is beginning to
understand that the people certainly do.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is how people have been making a
living for the last 50 years, the
[SPEAKER_24]: companies.
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_24]: Why don't you tell them about what we see
when we get, when we get to Toribio.
[SPEAKER_24]: These are big amounts of crops,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to see it because they've learned to
use lights to extend their vegetative
[SPEAKER_10]: season.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the hillsides, mountainsides are
covered with lights and it's entertaining
[SPEAKER_10]: to get up on a hill and watch the
thousands of lights turning on and off
[SPEAKER_10]: through the night.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's quite something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's allowed this place to become an
extremely competent producer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's a matter of figuring out the
production facilities and the products
[SPEAKER_10]: that the country is going to allow us to
produce from this bounty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're always just congratulating you for
your three years of consistency at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been quite a feat for you to,
and everyone else that helps you to do
[SPEAKER_10]: this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing information and it's
spreading around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we really appreciate, you know,
everyone coming on because it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's everyone that makes this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the people who watch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the people who come on and share
their time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And although we've had all sorts of
different ego clashes over the three
[SPEAKER_05]: years, I really, really, really want to
thank every single person that has,
[SPEAKER_05]: that has shared their time and made this
thing what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, Hash Church isn't owned by
anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not profited by anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a community venture that is owned by
the community for the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really want to thank everyone for
consistently making it through here and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and being willing to share, you know,
share your projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, I see Donnie in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Tony in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Indra in California and Wade and Sam
and all these people around the world that
[SPEAKER_05]: are all on this focused sort of agenda,
which is like, let's get cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: normalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get cannabis succeeding for,
for the people who have been suffering for
[SPEAKER_05]: the last 50 to a hundred years under its
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be great to see some of them
gain from this, from this new industry
[SPEAKER_05]: that is now breaking out of, out of the
black market and into, into the regular
[SPEAKER_05]: old market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony's out on the deck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big things happen in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: That just looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what about you, Indra?
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you been up to, my friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you been, you've finally got your,
your machines?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you got your machines produced?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a number of them under
construction now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually we have one of the finest
foundries in the world making the upper
[SPEAKER_13]: and lower chamber.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they ship it to air gas
corporation in Norfolk, Virginia,
[SPEAKER_13]: where they assemble it, tune it,
add the pump, set it up for maximum
[SPEAKER_13]: efficiency, bubble wrap it, and then they
drop ship it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't really even get to touch them
until they're completely made and working.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the guys that air gas really know what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Holloway America is the place
where we're getting, and it's all very
[SPEAKER_13]: high quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've offered a lot of upgrades on our
site, like a hydraulic lifting lid,
[SPEAKER_13]: complete computer control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should try and get you in touch with
Donnie Wershafter in Columbia there,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm sure that he's very much a
hemp guy as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the people I always am
the most inspired to pass you on to are
[SPEAKER_05]: the people who can both make oil from the
cannabinoids, but also make seed oil from
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed that they produce if they so
desire.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty huge option that I don't
see any other companies offering with
[SPEAKER_05]: their units.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we'll see you do some
disrupting in the industry here in the
[SPEAKER_05]: next couple of years, at least I feel you
in the sense that you're such a large
[SPEAKER_05]: scale guy that you're way ahead of your
time, literally like 15 to 20 years ahead
[SPEAKER_05]: of your time, which is, that's even more
than I've been ahead of my time in my
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm usually about a decade ahead of
myself, which is like not a compliment in
[SPEAKER_05]: a sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks to be ahead of your time,
especially because you got to wait 10 to
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 minutes or 20 years for the world to
catch up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that it's catching up with
you, Indra.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you're gonna have your great
disruption.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your technology is gonna disrupt the
cannabis industry a great deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, it's gonna disrupt it
for the better in a sense that something
[SPEAKER_05]: that can be so potentially dangerous and
could potentially contaminate and et
[SPEAKER_05]: cetera, et cetera, should only be done at
the highest levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything I've ever seen from you has
been that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll look forward to seeing that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're actually this year putting together
and working on the continuous extractor,
[SPEAKER_13]: which I outlined in my very early patent
in 2009, where we feed seeds or bud or
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever in one end.
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes through it, drops out,
clean out the other end.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a wipe set up like a set of
wipers on the inside of the tube.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that fractionates the oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the stuff goes in as flowers and comes
out the other end as animal feed and all
[SPEAKER_13]: the various fractions come on it as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a 24 seven operation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're building that in Kansas right
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We started on the proof of concept model.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only gonna be 10 feet long,
but it'll be the first of the continuous
[SPEAKER_13]: butane gas extractor.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it should prove to be something very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indra, will that be tractor mounted so you
could pull it in the field behind the
[SPEAKER_15]: harvester?
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll mount on the back of an 18 wheeler
and be pulled to any location to run any
[SPEAKER_13]: crop through.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not limited to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can run hemp through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can run roses through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can run whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually hemp is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying not to use any of your
patented words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well played, Indra.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Mr. Wade from the House of
Harlequin?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you feeling this morning,
my friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got you on mute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get him off mute there while he's getting
off.
[SPEAKER_22]: Still not technologically up to speed
here.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's okay, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I wanted to thank you for your
beautiful email that you sent me recently
[SPEAKER_05]: about just thanking everyone in the
community and thanking us for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if I replied because I
might have read it on my phone,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I did want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a touching email.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people still appreciate kindness in
this world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very nice when you're going through
stress to crack open an email and have it
[SPEAKER_05]: just be like, loving and compassionate and
positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for making my day that day,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_22]: Not a problem, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_22]: This has really changed my Sunday mornings
in a really beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_22]: Things are good here in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're still working on the local laws and
trying to convince the rural communities
[SPEAKER_22]: of Northern California that this is a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_22]: The Colladrius Network, I think Forrest
told me the other day that we were up to
[SPEAKER_22]: 140 families that were trying to help.
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's turning into a thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: The garden is really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm having to wear a sweatshirt today.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's cold outside already.
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a nice change.
[SPEAKER_22]: And yeah, I sent you that email because I
wasn't able to get on last week in this
[SPEAKER_22]: rural area.
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got problems with technology hookups
and all that.
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, that was from the heart like you
were commenting on.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just really appreciate what you're doing
here and the range of people.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, just look at the panel this
morning, the expertise and the real desire
[SPEAKER_22]: to see some sort of healing happening
around cannabis and people's relationship
[SPEAKER_22]: to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so looking forward to three years
and being able to invite all the past
[SPEAKER_05]: guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was hard going through and trying
to figure out who has been on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go through all the old hash
churches and kind of see different guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I wasn't able to invite
every single person because I didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: contact info.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely invited 55 people into
the show today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully some of those people will
stop in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And share a little bit about what's going
on and what's new in their world.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, and that idea of herb is the healing
of the nations.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a really beautiful thing going on
in this show around recognizing the
[SPEAKER_22]: healing potential and the possibilities
for all kinds of healing, not just
[SPEAKER_22]: physical healing, but emotional and
psychic, even economic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love watching them look at the buds on
Tony's camera right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just like looking at buds and
smelling buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's such a simple thing
right there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let me tell you what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my friend that my friends in
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is the grower right here.
[SPEAKER_18]: And she is growing vegan, organic and just
started using soil balance.
[SPEAKER_18]: And she's with her other half there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll balance.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, look at the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's this and there's a multitude of
reasons why that's completely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the main reason is that you can tell
it's fire through a webcam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's two thumbs up right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_18]: She's been following.
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been following Hashtag for a while
now, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Many years, many years like 13,
16.
[SPEAKER_18]: Episode 13, 16 linked up in World Cup.
[SPEAKER_18]: They came to the bubble.
[SPEAKER_18]: Chalice, chalice, chalice, chalice,
chalice.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then and then you showed me a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got a bunch of different genetics and
they're they are growing fire,
[SPEAKER_18]: bro, fire.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they also just upgraded to soil
balance.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're doing vegan, organic, indoor,
spectacular, spectacular stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: My favorite that I've seen out here was
the sugar black rose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me tell you, you have you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, I know how happy Tony is right
there because you got to understand we
[SPEAKER_05]: travel all over the world for people to
show us their nudge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's just say that nine out of ten
times it is not so dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that you pulled out like a ten
out of ten, I don't even see tens anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's really a congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm giving you props.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they're they also have a little shop
down here that sells glass and vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've got them a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_18]: He has a gift that they can fill up.
[SPEAKER_18]: They have they have really good rosin,
obviously, if they're if their blood looks
[SPEAKER_18]: like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: They've got good sense.
[SPEAKER_18]: My God.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're kind of a duo.
[SPEAKER_18]: They grow and make their own extracts.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a good link for sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_18]: To see what people do with a little bit of
inspiration, with some videos and to see
[SPEAKER_18]: them grab seeds like you're talking about
this mission.
[SPEAKER_18]: So think about like how has church and the
information and education that's out there
[SPEAKER_18]: has put this that information has become
fuel for someone like these two that are
[SPEAKER_18]: that are watching and eager and they're
extremely passionate about producing a
[SPEAKER_18]: clean, organic medical product for
patients.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, like that's the same way in
California.
[SPEAKER_18]: You get like five percent of the people
that are like extremists like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, yeah, maybe 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same way all around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always find that small, small
percentage, the percentage of what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for our people.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, they have been seated in Puerto Rico
and they're doing an excellent job that I
[SPEAKER_05]: can tell you that is like some super dank
from Cali or anywhere like that is
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me want to grind it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, it totally made me want
to grind it up, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, man, I would sift the shit out
of that, bud.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you've got some sifts, don't you?
[SPEAKER_18]: You have some sifts.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's wet because we've had it out
here, but like it was a fucking bomb,
[SPEAKER_18]: dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's like making rosin from his sift from
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's it's spectacular, actually.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm drooling.
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely top on the list for our
recruits out here for the Puerto Rican
[SPEAKER_18]: mission.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they rolled up.
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you guys rolled up with?
[SPEAKER_18]: You had a black bear.
[SPEAKER_18]: What was all the flavors that was in that
joint last night?
[SPEAKER_18]: Black dog.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you got that from Humboldt,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: The seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a little sift I cleaned yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one pile of shwag.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so this is the rosin made from a
good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Put it in the light.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's kind of hard to blow.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's rosin.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there's no sun right here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that you can get on the other side.
[SPEAKER_18]: That you can see on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: But the sift is really nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got those purple colors to it,
too.
[SPEAKER_18]: Look how sticky it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, it is sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that doesn't look like
rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's sticky.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that's the rosin made from the
sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Came from that bud that I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, welcome, Colton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, it's going great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you're in Boston at the free at the
rally there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're at the Boston Freedom Rally
and we're having a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Educating, as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had so many people tell those
stories and so many people educated that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait to do it some more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really imagine a single person
ever arguing with you after you tell your
[SPEAKER_05]: story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like every person you talk to,
you have convinced that cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine and should be allowed to be used.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the way I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you had people push back and argue
with you in regards to your message?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really the only person that would disagree
with my story would be someone in the
[SPEAKER_03]: political status.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say anything because I
don't want to be rude or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, just one person,
one person.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is the beauty of how kind
the cannabis community is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Colton coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, I don't want to throw him
under the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest comes in and is like, oh,
this company is trying to sue me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want me to be able to give this
to children for free.
[SPEAKER_05]: But oh, I won't name them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't mention them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't want to throw you under the
bus, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys lucky?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'll tell you, like disagreeing
with someone like Colton who would rather
[SPEAKER_05]: be illegally alive than legally dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that has got to be the most
hardcore cannabis slogan ever produced in
[SPEAKER_05]: our community to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I'm stoked on you, Colton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never stop what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the fact that you are the face of
medicinal cannabis these days and teaching
[SPEAKER_05]: and sharing with with what I would call
not the choir.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that you get to a lot of
people that are not necessarily the people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are, you know, like all lined up and
knowing this information already,
[SPEAKER_05]: but quite a few people that that are
actually learning it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that you guys are dealing with
plenty of families.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure your parents get calls with
people with Crohn's disease like like more
[SPEAKER_05]: than probably anyone else because you've
been so successful with your with your
[SPEAKER_05]: mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we get people messaging us
every day, not only for questions about
[SPEAKER_03]: Crohn's disease and cannabis, but as well
as cancer and all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's I mean, we're not necessarily
experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we know a little bit about Crohn's
and cannabis, but I mean, we don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, but we try and help as much as
we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would connect them with other people
that we know who have had success with
[SPEAKER_03]: those kind of ailments and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get them the help that they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what I would call you an
expert in in giving help, because you
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely are an expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trust me, when people contact you
guys, the help that you give them is never
[SPEAKER_05]: forgotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I hear such great things about you and
your mom?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, I love I love your story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love how it came to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was it hurt the first time,
you know, it was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, man, like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_05]: He he had to move away and he can't be
near his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just seems like every day that goes
by, I just see you growing into a mature
[SPEAKER_05]: young man that that I'm proud to have
representing our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So top notch to you, Colton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first got into thinking about
cannabis for my Crohn's disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: there wasn't anyone my age or anyone at
all that would say, hey, this this works
[SPEAKER_03]: really good for my Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't really anyone there for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now that I finally got this
information that could help a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people, I mean, the least I can do is
share it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and sharing it, you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we appreciate that you're sharing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the vibes at the Boston Freedom
Rally are awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got I've got a few friends down there
today as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Addison DeMora is in the house
with Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Bobby Nugs is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if he's with relief or if
he's just representing with himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you haven't seen those guys,
make sure you go say hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've ran into a ton of really awesome
people at the Boston Freedom Rally
[SPEAKER_03]: already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people with amazing stories and
with incredible success with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually met Peter Dante,
yesterday at the Cannabis threat,
[SPEAKER_03]: Boston Freedom Rally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, such a great guy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Colton, would you be my name is Wade and I
was wondering if you'd be willing to talk
[SPEAKER_22]: about the specifics of how you take
cannabis for your condition and what kind
[SPEAKER_22]: of dosing you're trying for and where
you're seeing success, because I have some
[SPEAKER_22]: folk that struggle with this exact
condition.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when when we first started,
we didn't my parents didn't really want me
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we first started, we were just on
the brownies because we didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would just buy it from some make it
into brownies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how we did it at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually, we found a caregiver that
the oils with the CO2 extraction,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to be specific, but it's just
the oil and I put a little pill capsules
[SPEAKER_03]: and I take it like a pill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each one of those pills has 15
milligrams of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I take it four times a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a total of 60 milligrams of each.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's equal parts.
[SPEAKER_22]: Equal parts CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Colton, I just want to say,
hey, Natasha here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to say thank you for what
you're doing about bringing awareness for
[SPEAKER_01]: THC for pediatric conditions, because
everyone knows that CBD has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits for children with epilepsy and
other conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we all know, THC kind of gets
thrown out or portrayed as the bad guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate the awareness
you're bringing to THC as a treatment for
[SPEAKER_01]: gut disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like I work with Crohn's and
colitis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone I talk to, the first thing I
ask is, do you know who Colton Turner is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you need to know his story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to follow what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and your mom, you're everywhere on
chat boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're providing so much help and guidance
to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, even the patients that contact
me, it gets overwhelming, because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to help so many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think you guys are doing an
amazing job staying positive, really
[SPEAKER_01]: showing that cannabis can help patients
get their lives back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all the work you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, there wasn't anyone out there
for me that could teach me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I can use cannabis for and how to use
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had to go through the trial and
error of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to figure out what cannabinoids I
needed to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to figure out what I couldn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found out that I need THC because
CBD alone doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may work for some other kids,
but for me, I need just as much THC as I
[SPEAKER_03]: do CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk a little bit more to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even in the epilepsy trials where
they're giving just high CBD, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: side effects that come up are,
intriguingly, a loss of appetite and
[SPEAKER_01]: diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've heard a lot of patients when
they add THC back, especially with gut
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders, that prevents those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about why you
find THC helps with your condition?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Crohn's disease is a autoimmune
disorder that causes inflammation in the
[SPEAKER_03]: intestines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps to bring down the inflammation,
but the THC, it's like a magnifying glass
[SPEAKER_03]: to the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes it really concentrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it work that much more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it opens the CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my parents trying to whisper stuff
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Wendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Colton has had a super, super long
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been kicking butt and taking names
at the Boston Freedom Rally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's extremely exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of his craziness this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've noticed that the THC,
not that we've noticed, but we've read
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the research that's actually
going on in Israel and other places about
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's disease, is that the THC is really
important to open the CB2 receptors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBD can attach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just, we're not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that works, and we're not exactly sure
that that is the exact method or the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what all the doctors are
thinking that that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've noticed that when people that
have Crohn's disease take a pill or take
[SPEAKER_00]: an edible, it metabolizes through the
liver and goes straight to the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works more effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are smoking, it's actually
opening up the CB1 receptors more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the CB1 receptors have to connect
to the CB2 receptors in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just takes a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, the trial in
Israel that we found was like 23% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: like 5% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nine out of 11 people found
remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's crazy about this plan is that it
helps everything and everybody in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to pinpoint everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have noticed that the edibles or
pill capsules with the oils in them are
[SPEAKER_00]: really effective for Crohn's disease and
all the patients that we follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we follow a lot of Crohn's patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And always with the one to one THC to CBD,
are there some variations that you see
[SPEAKER_05]: people using?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a few variations, but mainly one to
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if I would have to pick a
percentage of how many people are using a
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one, I would say it's probably
about 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a really big percentage that is
one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really depends on the person's
severity of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people that don't have such
severe diseases that can get away with a
[SPEAKER_00]: five to one or a seven or 10 or more CBD
than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people with more severe disease,
they tend to lean on the THC just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is across the board varying,
but about 90% need a one to one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting that it's a more severity that
would require the THC showing that that
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD only legislation would really like
people would fall through the cracks that
[SPEAKER_05]: are the most in need of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have something to say,
Tony?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I concur with the information and
data they shared.
[SPEAKER_18]: What's interesting about that is if you
look at the first plants in Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_18]: and what type of resin was, a lot of these
plants started as a one to one.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I do feel in nature there's a
balance there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it makes sense when you look at our
receptor system that when we talk about
[SPEAKER_18]: full spectrum, it's important to
understand that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Full spectrum is all of those cannabinoids
and THC and CBD happen to be a dominant
[SPEAKER_18]: one.
[SPEAKER_18]: And when they're in close ratio two to
one, three to one, one to one,
[SPEAKER_18]: you start to see significant benefits to
it, but you definitely need the THC in
[SPEAKER_18]: there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the results that we see as an example,
somebody said, okay, I'm going to use CBD
[SPEAKER_18]: for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe half of those patients would see
results and then half of those patients
[SPEAKER_18]: would see more than 30% effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_18]: You start adding a little bit of THC to
it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then those statistics and the way that
you're able to balance that or the way
[SPEAKER_18]: able to relieve that is increased
significantly, like 40% more.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, yes, CBD has a purpose,
but people have to understand that there's
[SPEAKER_18]: a full plant here and THC plays an
important role.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I agree with what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also noticed that there's a lot
of people who don't agree with what
they're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that, Wendy?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think they froze up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll be back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we got Brad in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad Higgins trying to figure out his mic
and his camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad is our light expert.
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that, Wade?
[SPEAKER_22]: Wade would pop in and say, I totally agree
with what they're saying as well.
[SPEAKER_22]: For in the members of the association that
I work with, we have a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_22]: conditions that people are trying to
treat.
[SPEAKER_22]: And again and again, we find that
something close to the one-to-one thing
[SPEAKER_22]: seems to give most benefit for the most
different conditions that people are
[SPEAKER_22]: trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_22]: To me, this is really important news.
[SPEAKER_22]: Epidiolex, the medication that GW
Pharmaceuticals is putting into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_22]: marketplace and is already in the UK,
is just CBD.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I love CBD.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I've really come to recognize that
it's not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all of the different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the thing is, our science doesn't
really know or understand what really is
[SPEAKER_22]: going to help us.
[SPEAKER_22]: But the plant provides, just like it is,
all of the things that seem to give
[SPEAKER_22]: benefit to so many different people.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's pretty astounding.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's part of what makes Hash Church holy
to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's part of what makes Hash Church holy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, if it wasn't for the THC,
I'd probably still live in pain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said if it wasn't for the THC,
I'd probably still live in a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the THC that helps me every day,
along with CBD and all the different
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, definitely the one-to-ones need
to help me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a three-to-one guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis saved my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's so many people here who want
to talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to jump off.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to see you guys all next
week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace and love, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks, Mark, for three years of Hash
Church and everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, you're coming by.
[SPEAKER_11]: See you tomorrow, buddy.
[SPEAKER_18]: To Puff the Terp.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're also going to go grab some
food, let people rotate in.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's a big episode.
[SPEAKER_18]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming in, brother.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_18]: And link up with you guys later.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_18]: And happy 300 for three years.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how's it going, Brad?
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can hear you loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have the clearest, loudest,
most perfect mic in the whole room right
[SPEAKER_05]: now, in fact.
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to say I can get the mic on a
new 4K camera from Logitech to work,
[SPEAKER_21]: but I can't get the actual camera to
video.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm stuck with the dusty one off the
laptop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's working perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that you're you know, I've been
following your lights information.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would I describe what you're really
doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of like at the cutting edge of
indoor light technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be an accurate way of saying
that?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we're trying to.
[SPEAKER_21]: We are.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been going through the industry kind
of disproving a lot of the myths that red
[SPEAKER_21]: light only grows plants off of 25 to 30
year old data.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're trying to reintroduce back into the
general public the idea that full spectrum
[SPEAKER_21]: light has a lot of blue light in it and
that plants and receptors take that blue
[SPEAKER_21]: light and make calcium liquid with liquid
to flow with a plant.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that way you don't have to use a lot of
cow mag like that to do with red light.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've also found out in 15 years that
blue light is the number one thing that
[SPEAKER_21]: keeps a plant healthy.
[SPEAKER_21]: It is directly attached to the RNA and DNA
structure of the plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_21]: rebuild itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't pretend to know everything
that you're doing, but I watch a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: what you post and I watch how you reply to
people and you just decimate every single
[SPEAKER_05]: person that tries to say something one
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just like, no, this is how it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last one you posted, which was a
shadow photo, and you were explaining the
[SPEAKER_05]: difference between the drivers and the
actual the bulb and that if they're not
[SPEAKER_05]: lined up on the same frequency,
maybe I'm not sure, but or electrical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it created this crazy distorted
shadow of your hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you showed like your light with
like a perfect shadow where it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_05]: five hands.
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the things that kind of rolls back
a little back to Edison days when Edison's
[SPEAKER_21]: crew tried to make a photon independent of
electromechanical waves.
[SPEAKER_21]: When in reality, a photon is just a matter
that's excited within the wave and we
[SPEAKER_21]: humans can see it.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only thing that's different
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: A photon itself may travel at different
speeds in its own color width by itself.
[SPEAKER_21]: But when you put it in the actual
mechanical wave, it travels at the speed
[SPEAKER_21]: of the wave, which in the old days they
used to call speed of light.
[SPEAKER_21]: But now we're reversing that.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're calling it the speed of the wave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just want everyone to know that I
invited Brad today because he's been a
[SPEAKER_05]: past guest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really have like almost a whole show
I want to spend with Brad because the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of knowledge that he has when it
comes to lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it's exciting because most of what
he knows, I do not know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all new to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very exciting to have more
information in regards to, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: growing this plant that we all love,
allowing this plant to express the way we
[SPEAKER_05]: want it to and understanding that the type
of light that you use, especially if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're an indoor grower, is going to have
an effect on that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Brad, do you think the official light
source that isn't as good as the sun?
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think there's any artificial light
source that is as good as the sun?
[SPEAKER_21]: There is, but you have to, it's a unique
light system that was invented about 20
[SPEAKER_21]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_21]: It spins, it holds six different lamps in
it, and it allows a fuller spectrum than
[SPEAKER_21]: the sun actually penetrates our
stratosphere with because it allows a full
[SPEAKER_21]: intensity of 10,000 Kelvin to be applied
within the light bulb spinning within the
[SPEAKER_21]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as it spins, basically all photons
flow off the mechanical wave as one.
[SPEAKER_21]: So the spinning light is now seen as a
single light source.
[SPEAKER_21]: So like a speaker, a full range speaker
playing from a single source instead of
[SPEAKER_21]: six lights spinning, if that makes any
sense.
[SPEAKER_21]: What company is that that does that?
[SPEAKER_21]: That company was invented, the technology
was invented 20 years ago by a friend of
[SPEAKER_21]: mine, Gerald Garrison.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I know Gerald.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a couple of his lights.
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_21]: He used to own Sunpulse.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's still involved with Sunpulse to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_21]: And he's one of the PhDs that we actually
have with us in the company that we use
[SPEAKER_21]: when we develop the lamp technology.
[SPEAKER_21]: See, reflectors themselves aren't that
special.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the actual ballast to lamps.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have to run like a speaker does,
like an amplifier to a speaker.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have a speaker that's a different
resistance to the amplifier, either the
[SPEAKER_21]: speaker's going to end up blowing because
it has too much distortion going to it
[SPEAKER_21]: because of the high resistance the
amplifier has to overcome or the amplifier
[SPEAKER_21]: itself will just simply shut down.
[SPEAKER_21]: And when you relate that to lighting,
you don't have the mechanical limits of a
[SPEAKER_21]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead, you have a salt packet that'll
just continue to burn, produce a ton of
[SPEAKER_21]: distortion in the form of heat until it
blows up and dies.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's how a lamp determines how much
total harmonic distortion is coming off of
[SPEAKER_21]: it is by the amount of heat.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have a lamp that's excessively hot,
even though it's a, say in the old days,
[SPEAKER_21]: a thousand watt, how many of us here
remember putting a 10 K thousand watt bulb
[SPEAKER_21]: in their ballast and that lamp running
hotter versus the three K.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the reason why is because 10 K
produces more electron volts per photon
[SPEAKER_21]: weight than three K does.
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's physically more information and
10 K color coming down to the plant,
[SPEAKER_21]: which also changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've gone deep into this lighting thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm, I'm absolutely stoked on this
information and I really want to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that you get back here for a full episode
where we can dwell, you know, deep into
[SPEAKER_05]: this because it's, it's a, I mean,
man, no, but it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to keep chatting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, I'm watching Colton right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's in, in Boston at the freedom rally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's freshly, you know, he's into this
for the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you love how deep the rabbit hole
goes on this Colton?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that all the information that we
have on this plan is absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys are all geniuses and I
would love to pick your mind some,
[SPEAKER_03]: but right now I've got to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why the call ended the first
time was because the phone died,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I got to go now because I got to make
my way to the Boston freedom rally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say, uh, terpenes are
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I also wanted to congratulate you
guys on the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole family for coming out and
sharing time with us on hash church.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I know you're going to have a
great day at the, at the, uh, freedom
[SPEAKER_05]: rally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hi to all my friends for me and,
uh, keep representing the way you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone, uh, who's watching right
now is going to the Boston freedom rally,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to be at the, uh, education
village, education village.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you can find Colton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy anniversary.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to jump in again,
cause Brad was talking about that awesome
[SPEAKER_11]: lights that I've been using in testing the
three 15th with the LEDs and everything
[SPEAKER_11]: else.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, yeah, I didn't want to come in
and comment on how well that bulb has
[SPEAKER_11]: worked for me and what I'm seeing with my
resin production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to welcome, uh, forest and D four
20 K and Mark Sheldon, Dr. Mark into the
[SPEAKER_05]: house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never mentioned, uh, I never mentioned
them when they came in and that is a
[SPEAKER_05]: shame.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy anniversary, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking that maybe, you know,
one of the things is I was going back and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at some of the old episodes and
trying to come up with what was my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was the favorite episode
moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to go back to the one that Brad
was on one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was like maybe like about
10 or 15, some early teens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brad came on and boy, remember Mark,
we had like a really rich conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: after we went off air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we talked for like another three or
four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if I remember correctly,
that's when the after hash church
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion started with that for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's, that's kind of something
that the, that the people who are watching
[SPEAKER_05]: don't really know when the converse really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, you know, often I'll leave
cause I got to go, but like a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of the panelists will sit and still
talk to one another for, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: another hour or plus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a, it's a pretty awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how we fell out with
inviting, with not inviting Brad for so
[SPEAKER_05]: long, but I'm very glad to have him back.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just got incredible information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the idea of doing a show where
we've got Peter from soil balance,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we've got Sam and we've got
Indra for, for breeding and extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get in Tony, Dr. Mark and Dr. David,
just like all these people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: specializing in this, it's an incredible
thing when we can put all the pieces of
[SPEAKER_05]: this puzzle together in one entity where
you've got your light guy and your soil
[SPEAKER_05]: guy and your food guy and your breeding
guy and your terpene guy and your
[SPEAKER_05]: processing from chemical solvents to
nonchemical solvents and everything in
[SPEAKER_05]: between.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, there's nothing really more
exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I look at hash church,
I think of it as the number one top
[SPEAKER_05]: fortune 500 cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we all worked together, it would be
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say, Forrest?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'd want to give away all the
products for free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your style, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have a whole part of, of,
of that company that you and Forrest could
[SPEAKER_05]: be in charge of just giving everything
away for free.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course it would all be patented,
but for free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing today, Forrest?
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy anniversary.
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great to see Colton on this morning as
well.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, uh, it'd be great to do an all
star patient episode there in the future.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad he's still carrying the torch
down there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, how's everyone else doing this
morning?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty top notch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got almost 700 people in the room
watching right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat is flowing wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I love the, I love the sort of
like chaotic con like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're talking about Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: One second, we're talking about lighting
the next.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're back at the Caladrius network.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about bond with default,
just keeping the flow going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, that's what hash church has been
all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a scripted event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally sent out the link yesterday
within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I let everyone know, Hey, if you can make
it, uh, I'm super stoked to see Donnie
[SPEAKER_05]: Werschafter in Columbia, doing his things
down there and being able to come in in
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia into hash church as one of the
first guests today.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really cool too, as well as Tony
in, uh, Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty darn cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: The spectrum, you know, I spent all night
last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was up till about one in the morning
finishing off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done four different revisions of our
skin topical cream for the kids with
[SPEAKER_14]: epidermal crisis below.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I showed some of those
difficult pictures on one of the episodes
[SPEAKER_14]: I was on here, this horrific skin
condition.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I don't know if people
realize that a lot of the people on this
[SPEAKER_14]: panel is just 24 hours a day, you know,
working.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, got the, we did four different
versions changing the, well, I don't want
[SPEAKER_14]: to get into it too much, but essentially
changing the recipe, removing things,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, trying to get skin absorption to its
max, uh, potential.
[SPEAKER_14]: And last night, finally I was able to
rescue where I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We made a large batch for the kids with
EB.
[SPEAKER_14]: So after the show today, we're getting
that packed up and we'll be sending out
[SPEAKER_14]: probably 75 packages to kids with EB all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will tell you, Forrest,
when I saw you holding up the five pound
[SPEAKER_05]: chunk of shea nut butter, I can tell you
that it definitely made me as happy and
[SPEAKER_05]: stoked as it made you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I could see the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was literally in tune with the
feeling of how I felt emotionally when I
[SPEAKER_05]: saw the photo, because, uh, you know,
you look past, you know, the reason you're
[SPEAKER_05]: smiling is, is because you're a righteous
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're helping catastrophically ill
children, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can't say enough about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, every time, every time you talk about
it, I want to donate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to, I want to help in any way,
shape or form that I can because,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we need to be reminded every day,
just like you said, that it's a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_05]: seven thing for these kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, being reminded once a week
might not be enough, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: to let people know that, man, there are
people suffering in their children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can do something as a cannabis
community to help them, like what Forrest
[SPEAKER_05]: is doing, well, then I'm going to get
behind Forrest and help him in any way,
[SPEAKER_05]: shape or form that I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that my community, our
community will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, preach it brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's just, we are involved with
a plant that has the power to change the
[SPEAKER_14]: world.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question is, are we going to
harness it or not?
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, five pound chunk, you know,
you're getting nerdy when you just go geek
[SPEAKER_14]: out over a five pound chunk of like the
best primo organic shea butter you can
[SPEAKER_14]: get.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had my hands on that yesterday,
like sneaking down the road, like,
[SPEAKER_14]: like it was hiding the kilo or something
like this, like pack thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I knew that was it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the last ingredient I need to make
a large enough batch to get out to all our
[SPEAKER_14]: families.
[SPEAKER_14]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the dose of cannabinoid in that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I haven't quite done the math,
but there's about a gram and a half.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's probably, and it's like 75% a high
THC strain, 75% ACDC.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're looking at, you know,
somewhere around 1500 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_14]: probably cannabinoids per jar.
[SPEAKER_14]: So not crazy, crazy, but definitely
stronger than most of what's on the
[SPEAKER_14]: market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a lot of steps added in to help
boost skin absorption.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have Harley Sue isolate terpenes
that are added in at the end, cold
[SPEAKER_14]: terpenes, and a lot of this process to try
to help add ingredients in that are going
[SPEAKER_14]: to boost that efficacy.
[SPEAKER_22]: So without inflaming the kid's skin.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Getting the dose right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, it's, it's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the serving size that you'd
recommend?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is just a two ounce, you got a two
ounce jar here.
[SPEAKER_14]: They could go a long way for people with
pain and skin condition.
[SPEAKER_14]: I made it for the EB kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I found was when we set that high
bar, it really worked well for everyone
[SPEAKER_14]: else, but the EB kids get this bad boy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, it's like a half a pint because
it's an entire body that they're trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: treat.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it goes quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: So.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they wrap in bandages after they put on
the cream?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So these kids, they have to bathe in like
bleach water every day.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after that, and if you look at
EB, you'll just see like their hands and
[SPEAKER_14]: their limbs are wrapped.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are actually bandages to keep the
skin on essentially in time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what the parents do is it goes,
and that's another thing is this has to be
[SPEAKER_14]: done like all like canning almost all
sanitary so that everything is sent to
[SPEAKER_14]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, yeah, they glove up and they get
sanitary depressors and other tools and
[SPEAKER_14]: basically they take the cream and they rub
thin layers onto the bandages and then
[SPEAKER_14]: apply the bandages onto the skin with
gloves and all those things keep
[SPEAKER_14]: everything sterile.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the wound healing time has improved at
least 60, 70%.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's dramatic.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't had a single family not call
back and go, holy, shit, this stuff is
[SPEAKER_14]: magic.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and then I say, no, it's not
magic.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cannabis and it does some amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I get to do my, put my educator
hat on, you know, to try to help them
[SPEAKER_14]: understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm not sure that you've ever
met my good friend, Hilary Black before,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if not, I would like to introduce you
to her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just came into the room and she is
also an angel, much like you are for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And both of you absolutely need to know
one another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hilary Black founded the BC Compassion
Club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Canada and recently just slayed
our government at the HESA hearings where
[SPEAKER_05]: she was able to speak in regards to
backing up patients as always,
[SPEAKER_05]: which she's always done and Forrest as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hilary has a son who suffers from
gastrolytic syndrome and also has taken
[SPEAKER_05]: this upon him to help catastrophically ill
children from afar as many as he can and
[SPEAKER_05]: weighed in the room as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gentleman with the big gray beard is
one of his growers and has helped breed
[SPEAKER_05]: the Harlequin and do some of this good
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys should all know each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Josh and Kelly from Dragonfly
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Hilary, that was unbelievable when you
spoke the other day in Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to tell you personally,
face to face, it made me so proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Forrest and Wade, it's such a pleasure to
meet you both.
[SPEAKER_08]: What part of the world are you guys in?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're in Northern California, Nevada
County specifically.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hilary, I've seen a lot of what you've
done up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then thank you for the fight.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been on.
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate it very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am super overdue for a trip to
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to have to come down soon and
meet some of my allies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hi, Natasha.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Donnie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello to all my pals that are on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: And out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to drop in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I often try to bail on Sunday mornings,
as Mark knows, because the last thing that
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do is talk about cannabis more
on Sundays because we do it all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a really big week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm super proud of what we did in
Ottawa on Friday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Canada has a legalization bill that's
passing through our government.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a health committee that is
going through the bill and has the
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity to make some revisions on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: With the bill, there's a lot of places
where they have not nailed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a bunch of us got to go out and speak
to the health committee and make
[SPEAKER_08]: recommendations to them about revisions
they need to make with the bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you only have 10 minutes to talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they ask you questions for two
hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's tricky trying to figure out what
you're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we put in a big submission and covered
all kinds of things that are all patient
[SPEAKER_08]: focused around the range of products that
they need to include and being able to
[SPEAKER_08]: extract CBD from hemp and a lot of issues
around affordability and investing in
[SPEAKER_08]: research.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we jammed a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the biggest push and impression that I
tried to make on them was around insurance
[SPEAKER_08]: coverage for patients, because as we know,
affordability is such a major issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not quite sure how it works in the
States.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in Canada, for people that have
private insurance through their employers,
[SPEAKER_08]: really most insurance companies will cover
cannabis if the employer chooses to
[SPEAKER_08]: include it in the package.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I brought with me two employees of the
federal government, one who's actually an
[SPEAKER_08]: assistant to an MP, and another who works
for the CRA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I told their kind of devastating
stories and really encouraged the
[SPEAKER_08]: government to include cannabis in the
insurance package for the employees of the
[SPEAKER_08]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because otherwise, in order for cannabis
to easily be included for medical
[SPEAKER_08]: coverage, it's going to need to get some
kind of an approval status and getting
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis through the process to get a drug
identification number.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many obstacles to it,
and it's super complicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I am hoping that we planted some
seeds of solution and that the government
[SPEAKER_08]: can kind of bypass their onerous,
expensive, crazy process to get permission
[SPEAKER_08]: to market a drug that cannabis will
probably never be able to tick all those
[SPEAKER_08]: boxes and include it in coverage for their
own employees, like take care of their own
[SPEAKER_08]: public servants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think that that would be an
amazing leadership initiative for other
[SPEAKER_08]: companies in the country and for the
world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where we went.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my amazing colleague Marcel van de
Beek came with me from the Compassion
[SPEAKER_08]: Club, and he has been the main buyer for
the Compassion Club for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when Dana Larson said,
I have probably sold more cannabis than
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the rest of the panelists combined,
I said, no way, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcel has had way more herb go through
his hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm talking metric tons.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also was shaking my head there as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Dana, no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've distributed way more than you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The worst paid pot dealers in the country,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, Dana's speech was also
beautifully well put.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine minutes and 45 seconds without a
timer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my God, he spanked them a few good
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like he had them over his
knee.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was just like, I'm just going to
spank you for a while here, because look,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is what I've seen in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I've seen in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was proud of all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you guys did a great job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonathan Zade.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I invited him in this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's a little bit busy,
but I definitely really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved his articulation and how just
perfectly, how well he explained himself
[SPEAKER_05]: and then was like, well, I'm on cannabis
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I highly doubt that any of you would
think that I am impaired.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was powerful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very, I don't know if it'll make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I was pretty shocked at the
knowledge level of some MPs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had, I should have watched more of the
hearings and had a better idea of where
[SPEAKER_08]: they were at because they need a lot more
education.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't, there's a lot of the basics
that they're kind of not understanding,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a bit terrifying.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're responsible for revising this
bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I continue to think that
it's a step in the right direction,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you know, there's way too many
barriers for small scale growers and small
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of problems with the
bill that hopefully this will just be
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: 1.0 and we can push it in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's kind of like they're making
rules for the new NHL hockey league,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they've hired like poets and painters
to make the rules instead of hockey
[SPEAKER_05]: players.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's sort of what it, sorry,
Brad, did you spit the bong water out of
[SPEAKER_05]: your mouth there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like the, it's like the most
anti-gay people making gay rights
[SPEAKER_05]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just, it's like, they're not
letting Nazis, you know, celebrate,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, do like a Jewish holidays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just doesn't line up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to say it any better,
but they just, they're not the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be hiring people to basically,
you know, be that, be that knowledge base,
[SPEAKER_05]: because listen, some of the questions they
were asking you guys.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Mark Emery and the true Mark
Emery style called them sadists actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, basically said,
you know, you've been punishing us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, stealing from us and,
you know, take it hurting our families and
[SPEAKER_08]: taking away our businesses and destroying
our homes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you're going to legalize cannabis,
but you're going to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: many of the provinces are leaning towards
government monopolies and there's no room
[SPEAKER_08]: for small business.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's hard for our own culture to get
in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was kind of yelling at them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you hate us?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like true, true Emery theater,
but we bring some of those same messages.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how the bill will get revised
as a result, but yeah, I was super proud
[SPEAKER_08]: of Marcel for sort of the kind of his
first time stepping in front of a camera
[SPEAKER_08]: and having a huge way, you know,
for 19 years, he's been the guy getting
[SPEAKER_08]: his hands dirty, doing all the purchasing
and quality control and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: being a main pillar of that organization
running and, you know, he put on his tie
[SPEAKER_08]: and came out to come and school the feds
with me and specifically to stand up for
[SPEAKER_08]: small scale growers and small business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way you put a lot of that small scale
growers and just the ill patients the
[SPEAKER_05]: patients who are going to fall through the
cracks, the way you put it was very
[SPEAKER_05]: important.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way these compassion clubs are,
you know, first lines of defense sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: thing where the pharmacies are not going
to be able to compete with that sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: compassion club healing center.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, psychology, like the, just the
talking and the vibration of making sad
[SPEAKER_05]: people happier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember it from the early days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember people walking in there with
their lips on the floors, all just bummed
[SPEAKER_05]: out and leaving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like excited and feeling like there's a
little bit of hope.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that in the cannabis industry,
hope is going to be a very important part.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mark, thank you for having my back for
20 years, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on, Hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been more than 20 years, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been since NPC days.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been since like 1907.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's gone back quite a ways and it's
been, it's amazing to watch you and Marcel
[SPEAKER_05]: be at that hearing and just be like,
wow, like, holy smoke, civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember what her name was Bogdan
or hogged in the woman who.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jacqueline Bogdan.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's the one who is the boss of the guy
who runs the legalization department and
[SPEAKER_08]: the guy who runs the medical department.
[SPEAKER_08]: So she's basically like the deputy
minister of any, everything related to
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's stuck in the role of being a
bureaucrat, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt that I only saw a few things that
she said.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing that worried me was that how
she, she felt that if we avoid allowing
[SPEAKER_05]: people with records, we can cut out
organized crime.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that they don't understand
that a organized crime from the beginning
[SPEAKER_05]: of time has always maintained people
without records to be their face.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they send kids to, to,
to become lawyers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They send kids to become in politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like real true organized crime will always
have people who don't have records
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in what they want them to be
involved in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas, whereas cannabis, I would say
that what percentage of cannabis arrests
[SPEAKER_05]: are organized crime related.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be like under 10%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Research around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really low.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's under, it is under 10%.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 7% or something, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it may be one of the pieces that we
have to rally some resources and get Kirk
[SPEAKER_08]: to go battle in court.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be one of the things that's
easier to fix in the bill through the
[SPEAKER_08]: legal system than through the sort of
parliamentary process in terms of,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like proving that it's like
contrary to the charter or unethical or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever magic Kirk can come up with to
fight for the rights of people who only
[SPEAKER_08]: have cannabis charges in the past,
being able to participate in the future
[SPEAKER_08]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine Seagrams if they made
rules when alcohol became legal that you
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't be a part of it if you were part
of pro bition criminals?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those guys, Seagrams, I mean,
those guys were alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sold alcohol way before it was
allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they just sort of transferred
over into this legal atmosphere to become
[SPEAKER_05]: a multi-billion dollar company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, why should it be any different for
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, first of all, why would you want to
keep people in organized crime from being
[SPEAKER_05]: a part of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't we want them out of the black market
and into the legal market?
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that the best way to, to devolve the
black market by pulling those people out
[SPEAKER_05]: and being like, here, just do this in the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly you know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly you have the skills.
[SPEAKER_08]: Screen out people that have, you know,
close connections to violence,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like those are really the bad apples that
need to be plucked out or, and maybe even
[SPEAKER_08]: like some blue collar crime.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't think people that have been
involved in like major financial scams,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that's way more concerning than
somebody who's... If we let the people who
[SPEAKER_15]: are involved with violence smoke more
cannabis, maybe they'll be less violent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that has to be fought on
the local level.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm working in here in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, people think that, well,
cannabis is legal in California,
[SPEAKER_14]: so it's all good, but the way they
structure it is local municipalities can
[SPEAKER_14]: just cancel out essentially everything
that the voters voted in except for a
[SPEAKER_14]: little bit of indoor action.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, that's something I'm on a
community advisory group for our county
[SPEAKER_14]: drafting local ordinances.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the sheriff keeps trying to slip in
there, you know, this live scan
[SPEAKER_14]: requirement for any sort of permits that
you can get.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you look at the live scan,
they look at even minor misdemeanors as
[SPEAKER_14]: prior, you know, drug misdemeanors as
disqualifying condition or disqualifying
[SPEAKER_14]: factor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just, you know, it completely
disproportionately impacts communities of
[SPEAKER_14]: color, minorities, you know, low economic
communities that have just been targeted
[SPEAKER_14]: for these things.
[SPEAKER_14]: So people who have had, you know,
dime bag misdemeanors now, they're saying
[SPEAKER_14]: they're not of the right character to do
any sort of business in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just, it's just another,
you know, continuance of this need to keep
[SPEAKER_14]: the thumb on people and repress them as if
they're bad or evil when it was the laws
[SPEAKER_14]: that were unethical to begin with,
not a lot of the behavior that was seen.
[SPEAKER_15]: The thing is that when they closed down
all the prisons, we could take all the
[SPEAKER_15]: security guards and they can grow and
sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he cut out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Hillary, I had a question about that
woman from Alberta.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was her trip?
[SPEAKER_05]: She was talking about that she didn't see
that we would save money if we stopped
[SPEAKER_05]: arresting people for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that person?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm not sure of that piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was a very kind of odd
hodgepodge panel where they had the kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of guys who seemed like older chatty,
schmoozy, professional lifelong
[SPEAKER_08]: politicians who, you know, like,
like the chairs of the municipality
[SPEAKER_08]: association from across the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that woman who is from an
association of municipalities from
[SPEAKER_08]: Alberta, and then you have the Emerys.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was kind of a, like, it was a bit of
a disjointed panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was definitely mostly what they were
saying was that they need more time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's sort of the biggest push
against the bill and against the liberals
[SPEAKER_08]: is that they feel like the liberals are
rushing it and there isn't time to get
[SPEAKER_08]: education strategies in place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And and also all of the enforcement that
they're looking at investing into,
[SPEAKER_08]: like $900 million into enforcement of
these regulations or something,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is just like insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, can we put like 25 of that or 50 of
that into like researching medical
[SPEAKER_08]: utility, particularly in face of the
opiate crisis in Canada?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of the hypocrisy I saw in her
statement was when she was asked about how
[SPEAKER_05]: much money would be saved when we stopped
making all these arrests, she claimed that
[SPEAKER_05]: she couldn't possibly know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas that's actually money that's being
spent today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could actually know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then she went on to say how much money
they would have to spend for these
[SPEAKER_05]: different things, which is money that has
never been spent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a complete and total guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just saw that she was very not like,
okay, oh, well, how much money will be
[SPEAKER_05]: will be saved if we stop making these
arrests?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm not an expert in knowing how
much money Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: The honest answer to that question is not
congruent with her agenda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The honest answer to that question is a
fuck ton, a shit load, a huge monster
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of piles of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how much everyone knows it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a secret or an agenda.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you stop arresting people for a
victimless crime, you will save an
[SPEAKER_05]: enormous amount of policing and court
money that I suspect will be astronomical.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also,
[SPEAKER_15]: when people get busted, they can't get
good jobs after that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be a real hindrance to decent
employment to support your family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not even counting the stress
that happens amongst families and breakups
[SPEAKER_05]: and divorces and families falling apart
and children suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the true human suffering is
incalculable, but the monetary we can
[SPEAKER_05]: calculate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very, very big number.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the part that a lot of people can't
really grasp is that butterfly effect
[SPEAKER_14]: impact on parts of our community where
you're just destroyed.
[SPEAKER_14]: The drug war ruins families.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you get a record and sometimes,
you know, especially if you get a felony,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you're done and that trickles
down generations.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when dad can't work,
you can't have stable homes, can't have
[SPEAKER_14]: good environment for kids.
[SPEAKER_14]: This sort of butterfly effect is,
it's not just a something that's in
[SPEAKER_14]: people's imagination.
[SPEAKER_14]: The immediate fiscal and financial
benefits are great.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, when you start to end that
more deep rooted damage in our
[SPEAKER_14]: communities, then we'll start to see
exactly the harm that this war has done to
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, welcome, Allison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Allison has made it into the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see you, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a patient who was on the medical
panel with me in Ottawa the other day,
[SPEAKER_08]: Daphne, who recently did something with
you guys at Rethink Breast Cancer,
[SPEAKER_08]: and she was singing your praises.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got to turn your YouTube part off,
Allison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just mute the YouTube part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, she's talking about Daphne.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Daphne.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved how she was so articulate in the
way she spoke, and her answers were very
[SPEAKER_05]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the fact that you mentioned CRA,
I guarantee you most people in the room
[SPEAKER_05]: had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's R-I-R-S.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada Revenue Agency.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is our, like, those are our scariest
people kind of thing in, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Canada, I'm always the most afraid
of the tax man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you guys doing Dragonfly in the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They always have the biggest smiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely have to come hang out with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to.
[SPEAKER_05]: All in good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: All in good time.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Marcus, we just wanted to take a
second to really thank you for all of the
[SPEAKER_19]: work that you've done for Canada and all
of the work that you've done for us,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I really- And the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Hilary, you too.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a lot of mutual friends,
and someday we're going to connect.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just really want to thank you from
the bottom of my heart.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I could shed tears for what you all
have done for us to even be able to have
[SPEAKER_19]: this greenhouse here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in B.C.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in the Coots.
[SPEAKER_19]: What?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get in my van and drive up
and come and have dinner tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're ready for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good Martin dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that goes for everyone on the panel,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone on the panel is incredibly
special.
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel blessed to be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about free invitations to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these guys also sent me a
beautiful email.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I have not yet to get back to,
because I read these damn emails on my
[SPEAKER_05]: phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're big and long and I shed
tears, I sometimes forget to go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these guys sent me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've sent me invitations like at least
like half a dozen and just beautiful,
[SPEAKER_05]: positive words, much like Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm definitely coming out to Dragonfly
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for all I know, I'll have Hilary with
me when I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're we're due for an adventure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit the Coca-Cola with you, girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know exactly where we were going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Photos that resulted.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's over 10 years ago, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're overdue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now we're in our Wally Peony.
[SPEAKER_19]: So or a can of Peony, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll show you a 12 foot hole in the ground
to control temperature.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that is so smart.
[SPEAKER_16]: So smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can show you correctly, it's really
short.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right there, like three, four feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you can see, but that's
how it is right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like the Guatemalan sinkhole?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the Bolivian sinkhole,
I think, because the word Wally Peony is
[SPEAKER_07]: Bolivian.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so I'm moving fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm standing on this walkway that
we built.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, tell me what's in the back left.
[SPEAKER_07]: That big, tall, narrow leaf drug cultivar
there, that big Christmas.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an auto CV cultivar, O-T-T-O from
the Austrian.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an original male, met a female,
took seven years for them to connect.
[SPEAKER_19]: And supposedly from Coastal Seeds,
it's a 30% CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, good luck with the male auto here in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: As across with THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's where we got it from.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got it from Graham.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Michael and those people are really
close family of ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: That reminds me of old school herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to say that all this was
grown veganically with plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: all closed loop from our farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: No commercial nutrients anywhere in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys will be selling this all at
the local high school?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I think Wayne and I might need to
do next week from the garden.
[SPEAKER_14]: That looks fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we do our teas to have a big
tea spot there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we chop up weeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use ferments to ferment the weeds and
we gravity feed the water into the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really fabulous and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we get to use herbal remedies to do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we like dandelions, like nettles,
like comfrey, cannabis itself,
[SPEAKER_07]: trees, leaves, cannabis roots,
burdock roots.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got a whole lot of polypores.
[SPEAKER_19]: We collect polypores from all of the local
woods around in this area and go to the
[SPEAKER_19]: birch trees because of the betulanic acid.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we can really go on and on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could kind of go nuts and go on and on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what House Church is for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on and on.
[SPEAKER_16]: Biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are nailing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We decided to live far away out in the
mountains and raise our child,
[SPEAKER_07]: homeschool him, live far out in the
mountains and survive the best we could
[SPEAKER_07]: and travel the world and do all this fun,
amazing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we used making medicine and growing
medicine and growing food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could walk you through all of our food
gardens.
[SPEAKER_19]: Someday, someday that we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost the camera for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see your dragonfly earth medicine
pure is what's recording.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was amazing while you were showing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you are again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was that's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, when you first went like
this, yeah, Josh, when you held up the
[SPEAKER_05]: camera and said, we're in here,
man, I'm telling you it went.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't even really tell if there was a
single plant in your in your greenhouse
[SPEAKER_05]: the way you came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you went like this and it changed
the lighting and you just saw the canopy,
[SPEAKER_05]: trust me, go back and watch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you lovely people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to say so nice to see your
faces.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I definitely do want to come up to the
coots and visit you and to all the rest of
[SPEAKER_08]: you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Sunday, old friends and new friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll see you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much for coming uphill.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Allison, give thanks to Allison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Allison is my gracious host.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you are so busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're more busy now that you're
in the cannabis industry than you may have
[SPEAKER_05]: been when you were in the rethink breast
cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny, because when Hillary was
talking about Daphne and I was thinking
[SPEAKER_12]: back, like just as she spoke, I had this
thought of the 15 years that I've been
[SPEAKER_12]: working with young women with breast
cancer and how that really should have
[SPEAKER_12]: been way more stressful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the right word, but emotional.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that should have been much more
physical and emotional for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was realizing, yeah, you're kind of
right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think these four years of working in the
medical cannabis industry have been
[SPEAKER_12]: definitely busier than anything I've ever
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was great work that you did at
Rethink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy to have met you when I
did, as you were kind of leaving a foot
[SPEAKER_05]: out of Rethink.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a foot into the cannabis industry
helped me get onto the panel there with
[SPEAKER_05]: Rethink Breast Cancer in Toronto,
where I met Judith and still talk to her
[SPEAKER_05]: every once in a while through,
remember how much you were crying?
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like, oh, Mark, it's,
you know, because you've had such bad
[SPEAKER_05]: luck, bad, bad, you know, with women that
get this disease and then pass away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, no, I feel like Judith is
going to, she's a survivor.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a thriver and she's, she's doing
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely harder for young women for
sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a more aggressive disease in young
women.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's been my experience, but I know
that Judy has been working with you and
[SPEAKER_12]: others and using medical cannabis as part
of her overall routine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she seems to be doing really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what's her status?
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't spoken to her in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: She got herself a little puppy and right
after she got the puppy, something
[SPEAKER_05]: terrible happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got stitches and she was sick to her
stomach, but I was just like, you know
[SPEAKER_05]: what?
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me feel good that her worry wasn't
on herself, that she was able to worry
[SPEAKER_05]: about something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that she's able to worry
about something else for those of you that
[SPEAKER_05]: have suffered true health risks,
you know that that's a big fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: stepping stone when you can finally stop
worrying about your own mortality and
[SPEAKER_05]: worry about something outside of yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while we have you here, Alison,
I would love for you to sort of speak,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's give Rethink Breast Cancer a little
bit of our audience and sort of tell us
[SPEAKER_05]: what was the thinking behind Rethink
Breast Cancer and how you and MJ kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: came about starting it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: But first I have to say happy anniversary
for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Mark so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really do owe him more than he can ever
know, even though I try and tell him in
[SPEAKER_12]: terms of the education that he's given me
over the last four years around medical
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis, because while I've been a
lifelong, well, since I was 14 cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: user, I had no idea half the stuff that
I've learned since I've met Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to say thank you to Mark
and everyone on the panel, because it's
[SPEAKER_12]: just been a wild ride of education and
learning from all of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you and happy anniversary.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Rethink Breast Cancer about 17 years
ago, we started the organization and it
[SPEAKER_12]: really just started as a way to try and
engage young women in the breast cancer
[SPEAKER_12]: cause.
[SPEAKER_12]: Back then, everything for breast cancer
was really about pink ribbons and teddy
[SPEAKER_12]: bears.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as young women, we didn't feel that it
was really speaking to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was more from an education
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we felt the movement was really kind of
frilly and strangely feminine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as young feminists, we felt like this
isn't really speaking to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was very scary to think about
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And from an education standpoint,
it was, you know, one in nine women will
[SPEAKER_12]: get breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: So check your breasts for lumps.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was like, why would I ever do that?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to ever think about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how it really started simple,
just simple, like, Hey, can we use humor
[SPEAKER_12]: and a different type of messaging and
fashion and film and all the things that
[SPEAKER_12]: young women are into to get women to think
about their breast health.
[SPEAKER_12]: But right away, as soon as we started the
organization, young women who had breast
[SPEAKER_12]: cancer started calling us and saying,
we love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you might not be aware, but there's
nothing for us out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: We go to support groups, and it's all
women in their 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've had their children,
they have some savings.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm 27 years old.
[SPEAKER_12]: How do I tell my boyfriend of six months
that I'm having a double mastectomy?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm only on contract because I'm just
starting out my career.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's nothing, you know,
I can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't make money.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to move back home.
[SPEAKER_12]: And right away, MJ, my partner and myself
were like, Oh, my God, these young women's
[SPEAKER_12]: needs are so big.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we started to realize that cancer
was more aggressive in young women.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really was the birth of us
starting to do national support work for
[SPEAKER_12]: young women, and learning more and more
about cancer in young women.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the journey.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it still continues.
[SPEAKER_12]: I left the organization as a staff member,
three and a half years ago to work in the
[SPEAKER_12]: medical cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: But MJ is still leading the charge over
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I encourage everyone to check out the
site and to, you know, give feedback and
[SPEAKER_12]: thank you to Mark for being on the panel,
because we think has started to try and
[SPEAKER_12]: educate our patients about medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not an easy journey.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a fine line to walk with the
oncologists on our board.
[SPEAKER_12]: But everyone's starting to come around and
realize that this is something they need
[SPEAKER_12]: to investigate more, especially as the
oncology journal did a full, full,
[SPEAKER_12]: full, the whole journal devoted to medical
cannabis about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: So things are starting to move along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alison.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_19]: Alison, I just wanted to thank you two for
all of your work.
[SPEAKER_19]: My mother was a young cancer survivor at
30.
[SPEAKER_19]: She just recently passed at home with us
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: She was a lifelong.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was she worked with women and with
cancer.
[SPEAKER_19]: She helped a lot of women die.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a little secret love affair for
you and what you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, your work and and getting
out there to young women is just so
[SPEAKER_19]: incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you've touched my heart very deeply.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: But really, I have to like MJ Dakota.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was the vision.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was lucky enough to meet her when I was
27 years old.
[SPEAKER_12]: She'd already been working in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Said, hey, want to start an organization?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And together we shared an office for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was so blessed for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm my heart goes out to you and your
mom.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know what it is to work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Work with dying women.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is anyway, let's not go there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your garden is beautiful and you look like
beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I just wanted to say that my mom was
a very conservative woman and she started
[SPEAKER_19]: to realize, you know, through me and my
brother, the healing attributes of CBD and
[SPEAKER_19]: THC and all of the different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I the very last words that she said on
her deathbed was that when she comes back
[SPEAKER_19]: in her next life, she's going to smoke a
lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: She got from it and it really helped her
pass on.
[SPEAKER_19]: My son got up onto the bed with a big
volcano, old school from Bob Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_19]: We ran down the road and got it from Bob.
[SPEAKER_19]: He still had one and put it over her.
[SPEAKER_19]: And my son enveloped her in smoke.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what helped her pass to the
other side.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, my heart goes out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big ups to everybody that's working with
the dying and hospice and terminally.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's some of the most sacred work we
could be doing with this plan.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you all for being witness to that
and for service.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's huge, huge work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to have the ability to
process that energy properly, because in
[SPEAKER_05]: our society, you know, the whole death and
dying thing has not been really an open
[SPEAKER_05]: dialogue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something we just kind of like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to rethink dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: There needs to be a rethink dying,
because people are terrified of that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally, when we're scared of
things, we don't want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just like Alison said, like, I don't want
to check my breasts for lumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a shitty campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm afraid to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, come at me some different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we very much need that for death
in our society.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in every culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some cultures that deal with it
quite well, but I don't see it happening
[SPEAKER_05]: too well here in North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Particularly difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just going to say it's a real
challenge.
[SPEAKER_14]: At the Colladrius Network, you know,
we're dealing with children, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: them are terminal, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's hard to keep volunteers,
you know, and it's hard to get people to
[SPEAKER_14]: shift the paradigm of seeing the beauty
and the benefit of improving the quality
[SPEAKER_14]: of life and not looking at it as a
failure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And understanding how sometimes just as
big as a gift is saving a life can be
[SPEAKER_14]: having a life not end in torment and
suffering.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is something that when you can
see it, you can feel the warmth and the
[SPEAKER_14]: love of the situation and let it go
through you.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is a difficult transition.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's one that I've seen some of the
greatest caregivers for terminally ill and
[SPEAKER_14]: in hospice type situations.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I know that Alec brings up
Valerie Corral a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's taught a lot of us some of these
lessons.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a paradigm shift that I agree
with you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: If could happen would definitely help our
empathy as a culture as a whole and help
[SPEAKER_14]: us treat people with a little more respect
during those times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to say, especially with
young women, it's unexpected because of
[SPEAKER_12]: what you're saying, Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not something we often talk about or
you think about when you're young.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the shock of that and having young
children yourself or not accomplishing the
[SPEAKER_12]: things that you set out to accomplish,
you know, you had all these ideas about
[SPEAKER_12]: the way your life was going to go and
nobody's spoken really about death or you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or it's not spoken about.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the shock of that when you're in your
20s or 30s, it's really hard to come to
[SPEAKER_12]: the other side of that in your mind and be
able to sort of embrace what you're going
[SPEAKER_12]: through.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I've witnessed, really.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask a question real quick?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you're working primarily with
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you guys developed general protocols
that you see work best as far as treatment
[SPEAKER_14]: options?
[SPEAKER_14]: With cannabis and breast cancer as opposed
to other cancers?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm now on the board of the
organization, so I'd have to hand that
[SPEAKER_12]: question over to some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: But are you saying just to clarify your
question, you're asking how have we
[SPEAKER_12]: created protocols for our patients around
how to use medical cannabis in conjunction
[SPEAKER_12]: with traditional medicine or you're saying
in relation to other cancers?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know, I don't want to go too far
down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought I'd just ask generals and we
can move on if you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've read a lot of research and
there's a lot of some conflicting
[SPEAKER_14]: information about how breast cancers are
formed and what types of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_14]: approaches are best to treat them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just giving the surface of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just thought I'd ask if you've seen if
you guys have said, no, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_14]: a correlation and we tend to treat it a
little differently than perhaps your other
[SPEAKER_14]: types of tumor based cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's the thing about breast
cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: In general, there's been so much funding
for breast cancer over a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_12]: cancers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the research, there is a lot of more
research done into breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_12]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_12]: As I said, the I think it was the I can't
remember exactly which it is the Breast
[SPEAKER_12]: Oncology Journal.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure that had devoted the
entire journal to cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess what you're talking about is
making correlations between some of the
[SPEAKER_12]: research done there and other cancers,
which I think is something that's
[SPEAKER_12]: important across the board, not just with
cannabis, but with all the the treatments
[SPEAKER_12]: that have been developed for breast cancer
and even the knowledge around breast
[SPEAKER_12]: cancer is so deep with regards to
understanding all the different types of
[SPEAKER_12]: breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that often when I've been at
conferences, people say breast cancer has
[SPEAKER_12]: way more funding than every other cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I work in this very rare cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I totally understand that that's a
huge challenge for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Alison, if I may ask a quick question.
[SPEAKER_16]: With the breast cancer patients that
you're working with, is it is diet and
[SPEAKER_16]: shifting to a full organic type produce
diet kind of part of how you work with
[SPEAKER_16]: these patients?
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, Rethink Breast Cancer,
we're primarily a fundraising organization
[SPEAKER_12]: that does education and support work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we work really closely with the
patients that have, you know, come in our
[SPEAKER_12]: part of our organization.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, in terms of education,
we have tons of information and links that
[SPEAKER_12]: we provide to our patients around healthy
eating lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do yoga retreats, stress, distress,
meditation.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to provide as much as we can
around medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's really we just put the information
out there and try and provide,
[SPEAKER_12]: as I said, retreats and different things
to be able to bring people together to
[SPEAKER_12]: have those conversations.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we see often and all the time,
young women come through over many,
[SPEAKER_12]: many, many years, long before it was,
you know, there was Whole Foods to go and
[SPEAKER_12]: do your organic shopping around the corner
that are shifting their diets.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mark and I have talked about this as
well.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really challenging because I can
remember even 10 years ago, one young
[SPEAKER_12]: woman having come back from Europe and she
was eating only broccoli she was trying to
[SPEAKER_12]: show us all the medical research around
just eating broccoli.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've had so many stories like this
where it was hard because you're looking
[SPEAKER_12]: at what is supposedly medical research,
but it's all conflicting.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we try and just say, here, here's all
sorts of links.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's all sorts of information.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take it and and make your best decisions
because it's so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, imagine you're 27 years old.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're diagnosed with a stage four breast
cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, to start thinking like that,
you're going to have to figure out exactly
[SPEAKER_12]: what to eat, where to eat, where to go,
how to breathe, how to meditate,
[SPEAKER_12]: treatment, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like really, we're also just trying
to respect that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, no big time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry, I wanted to come in really
quick on your question.
[SPEAKER_19]: We also work with a lot of women in breast
cancer, and it's sort of been a real
[SPEAKER_19]: passion of mine.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Paul Stamets work with polysaccharide
K is a direct and it's turkey tail or the
[SPEAKER_19]: coriolis versicolor.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also it finds its way in the forest
and many other different forms and
[SPEAKER_19]: coriolis.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I just wanted to say that we now are
mixing, blending the turkey tail,
[SPEAKER_19]: the polysaccharide K with the CBD THC,
making caps out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's been really helpful to women.
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, we don't have the science
behind it, but we have patients that have
[SPEAKER_19]: been taking it for a very long time with a
lot of really, you know, they keep going
[SPEAKER_19]: back for their treatments.
[SPEAKER_19]: The cancer is not growing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Paul Stamets healed his mother of
stage four breast cancer just simply with
[SPEAKER_19]: turkey tail.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe that we could really open up
the doors and have conversations about
[SPEAKER_19]: melding Myco with Kana.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that those two need to come
together to create a smarter medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_19]: A red belt right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the reasons why I brought that up,
too, is I was just recently at the
[SPEAKER_16]: National Heirloom Expo in Santa Rosa,
and I had the blessed opportunity to see
[SPEAKER_16]: Vandana Shiva speak and present.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's this world renowned kind of seed
freedom activist, and she's like public
[SPEAKER_16]: enemy number one against Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's been like pivotal in kind of the
grassroots rejection of glyphosate and
[SPEAKER_16]: genetic modified crops in India and a
couple other countries.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's pushing really hard.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's almost about to get rejected on the
renewal in France.
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, she was there and Bobby
Kennedy, one of the Kennedy's,
[SPEAKER_16]: was there, who's this longtime
environmental lawyer and activist.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were presenting, and they were
talking a lot about breast cancer and how
[SPEAKER_16]: in Sonoma County, wine country,
in Napa Valley, apparently the highest
[SPEAKER_16]: breast cancer rates in the United States.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they were spending most of the time
getting deep on glyphosate and the way
[SPEAKER_16]: it's been kind of sold to us to not affect
this certain enzyme in our body because it
[SPEAKER_16]: affects an enzyme that's in a plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: But all this research now shows that
although it doesn't affect the enzyme that
[SPEAKER_16]: humans produce, because humans don't
produce this enzyme plants do,
[SPEAKER_16]: but apparently microbiology does produce
this enzyme.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so slight acute buildup exposures to
kind of glyphosate from kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: conventional processed foods that might
have slight small amounts in it seem to be
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of destroying stomach microbiome.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then creating these conditions for so
much leaky gut and systemic inflammation.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then afterwards they showed this
documentary, one of the best documentaries
[SPEAKER_16]: I've ever seen on the subject,
but it's called Secret Ingredients.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's supposed to be out sometime in
the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_16]: But as far as cancer, there's a couple of
different patients in this documentary
[SPEAKER_16]: that kind of are showing and addressing
cancer, but also a child with autism and
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of this kid with autism they tracked
him over five or six years.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this child was the first child in the
United States to be tested for in his
[SPEAKER_16]: blood and his urine for glyphosate and had
eight times the amount allowed for sprayed
[SPEAKER_16]: on crops kind of thing and his body built
up.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they immediately shifted the kid to
gluten-free, full organic, really mindful
[SPEAKER_16]: approach towards his diet.
[SPEAKER_16]: And after five years, his autism,
which you saw in the documentary,
[SPEAKER_16]: this child and his mannerisms in his face
kind of completely shift and now has no
[SPEAKER_16]: signs of autism, no signs of developmental
disabilities or disorder.
[SPEAKER_16]: But time and time again, it's just amazing
how much we're realizing that we're not
[SPEAKER_16]: being gassed by the people like Dow who
used to make mustard gas and Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_16]: Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're being almost like slowly,
acutely built up with toxic amounts of
[SPEAKER_16]: these different pesticides and herbicides.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're poaching us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, poached.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, I mean, it's just amazing how much
the pesticide and herbicide thing has to
[SPEAKER_16]: do with this.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just adding Dacamba is Agent Orange
and that's the new, you know, we thought
[SPEAKER_19]: that glyphosate was bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's look at Dacamba.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start talking about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold, de-folding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, we saw it on the side of a
railroad when we were driving up,
[SPEAKER_07]: there was this railroad like, holy shit,
every single thing on the side of the road
[SPEAKER_07]: from the trees up 20 feet all the way down
this whole entire railroad corridor was
[SPEAKER_07]: dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: and Canada about Dacamba and Dacamba drift
and this whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an Agent Orange defoliant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only thing that can survive it is
their genetically modified crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I also wanted to say, you know,
what you're talking about Alec is that Max
[SPEAKER_19]: Gerson, you know, he was somebody,
if ever you all want to know about
[SPEAKER_19]: cleaning out the microbiome and,
you know, maybe even a relation of cancer
[SPEAKER_19]: as a fungi or an unbeneficial in that way
is to study Max Gerson's information.
[SPEAKER_19]: He works with pretty much retaking.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think there's a weird noise going
on.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_19]: Open my back on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was Forrest's mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just has to keep it muted when he's not
talking and we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: So, the Gerson therapy is something that
you can go down into Mexico because the U
[SPEAKER_19]: .S.
[SPEAKER_19]: shut them down many times.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's typical, but they just take
juice therapy and and enemas and pretty
[SPEAKER_19]: much reevaluate the entire system with
doctors from all over the world and
[SPEAKER_19]: specialists.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, pretty much create the whole
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in a toxic environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It affects some of our bodies more than
others.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every day we really, really could and
should eat foods that flush our body and
[SPEAKER_07]: then eat foods that represent a healthy
place on Earth.
[SPEAKER_19]: And welcome in beneficials.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we're eating something that came
from a healthy place on Earth,
[SPEAKER_07]: then that affected that biome,
which is a pollinator biome or a soil
[SPEAKER_07]: microbiology biome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it goes into our guts and it
flushes all of the toxins out of our
[SPEAKER_07]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we go at it more direct with
cannabinoids and terpenes and and
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else that we need that to come
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we really, really believe in the daily
diet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_16]: And especially in this new brave new world
we live in of.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's sadly, you know, the green
revolution has left behind this real this
[SPEAKER_16]: toxified environment.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to do as much as we can to keep
preventative kind of super immune strength
[SPEAKER_16]: building stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because one of the other trips about this
documentary, they were getting into how,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, when tested, you know,
apparently like eight out of 10
[SPEAKER_16]: vaccinations tested.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's positive for glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not like glyphosate is being
added into vaccinations.
[SPEAKER_16]: But what they found is that in the mass
vaccination industry, there were gelatin
[SPEAKER_16]: is a major component towards like
vaccinations.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the gelatin, apparently from the
hooves of the cows that are walking on and
[SPEAKER_16]: stomping and just being all about or all
over glyphosate apparently is getting in
[SPEAKER_16]: measurable amounts, finding detectable
levels in vaccinations and and the and
[SPEAKER_16]: Bobby Kennedy was presenting about a big
class action lawsuit that's about to be
[SPEAKER_16]: coming forward around this exact topic.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, so it's like, you know,
how do we even as human beings from the
[SPEAKER_16]: time we're born and told that we have to
vaccinate our child, how do we how do we
[SPEAKER_16]: like prevent or keep, you know,
with all this new reality of toxic
[SPEAKER_16]: environment stuff, glyphosate is
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: So how do we I mean, it's like diet and
micro and everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vaccine question is a sensitive one,
too, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you, you want to get like you
want to get flamed on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say you either don't support or you
support vaccines.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, and it's interesting, too,
because like I know for a long time,
[SPEAKER_16]: like Jenny McCarthy, she was kind of
trying to find like that, like thimerosal
[SPEAKER_16]: or, you know, this mercury kind of
derivative thing was one of the things
[SPEAKER_16]: that was behind it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think, yeah, that's since been,
you know, debunked this or that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, yeah, it was just
fascinating seeing kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: Bobby Kennedy, you know, this huge
environmental lawyer kind of presenting
[SPEAKER_16]: about this glyphosate kind of,
you know, kind of from the industry of
[SPEAKER_16]: making vaccines or vaccines, you know,
using the hoofs from the kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: industrial process.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's like, wow, that is mind blowing
how, you know, we're then poisoning the
[SPEAKER_16]: entire population through these,
you know, what what were back in the day
[SPEAKER_16]: in World War Two, you know, nerve agents
use them people now on plants and then
[SPEAKER_16]: like make it to people through the amounts
we eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for having me on all these times.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming out for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always appreciate your perspective and
yeah, give the family a hello and a hug
[SPEAKER_05]: and have a great Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for us.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for all you do, bro.
All right.
Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Allison.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I was going to say in listening to all
this and it's so challenging because we
[SPEAKER_12]: also live in this environment where at
least here in Toronto, it's high stress
[SPEAKER_12]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm hearing everything and thinking
about all these things and thinking,
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, we need to, you know, overhaul the
kitchen, overhaul everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not doing right by my kids,
you know, beating myself up.
[SPEAKER_12]: How can I do more?
[SPEAKER_12]: How can I learn more?
[SPEAKER_12]: And how can I continue just to get through
the day to day?
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not just for myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just using myself as an example.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it just becomes a real challenge to
also find the balance and the love and
[SPEAKER_12]: self acceptance and move through all of
these things that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to put it out there where
it's like, you know, just how do you how
[SPEAKER_12]: do you move forward and do what you can?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the that's the everyday question
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: How to not let the stress of the world
crush you while you're just trying to as D
[SPEAKER_05]: laughs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stress of the world isn't going to crush
you, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, overhauling your your diet
and trying to find the right foods and all
[SPEAKER_12]: this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's it's a major endeavor that has
to be done, but done with love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's I call it the bioassay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, man, everyone knows what they
like and what makes you feel good and what
[SPEAKER_05]: makes you feel bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's you can go as deep into the
science as you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you just trust your own intuition
and your own body, you start communicating
[SPEAKER_05]: with yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of like what meditation and
yoga, all these things are just trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: get these everything aligned so you can
hear yourself and know what you want and
[SPEAKER_05]: desire without being manipulated by
outside sources like, hey, you need the
[SPEAKER_05]: new Yeezy's.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to get the new 42 inch 65 OLED TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the matrix.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just constant, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's constant matrix like, oh,
this is new noise canceling headphones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, did you see my new it's just.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that deep bong rip, everybody,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Blake comes in right at the first bong
rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Tim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you do it right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, Tim.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_25]: Very honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_25]: You've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_25]: Every time I come on this, people tell me
it's one of their favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you know, a lot of props.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's all of the people, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's it's because everyone decides to
come and share their stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just yeah, we've had some excellent
dialogue today and it's been flowing
[SPEAKER_05]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're excited to have you come in and
tell us what you've been up to and what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on in the world of Tim Blake.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're getting ready there again this year.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's coming up quick.
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, you know, Alec and Josh
over there, Dragonfly, Jesse Dodd,
[SPEAKER_25]: we have so many people that contribute to
it.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really become a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't even feel like it's my show
anymore.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really a show for the whole
community.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's really humbling.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's an honor to do that.
[SPEAKER_25]: But there's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_25]: They're talking about the local
ordinances, the stuff and and the
[SPEAKER_25]: prisoners and people and going to jail.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's so many issues to deal with.
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the things we're going to deal with
this year we're going to bring to the
[SPEAKER_25]: light is that we're all going to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_25]: But we have like, you know, over 10,000
federal prisoners and prisoners doing long
[SPEAKER_25]: term jail sentences in these states across
the country that we can't go into
[SPEAKER_25]: legalization without stopping that.
[SPEAKER_25]: The cannabis POWs have to get out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Joe Arpaio gets able to get off
them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we have to fight for the drug war
vets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_25]: They got to get out.
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Xanar Xavier, the attorney general,
we met with him at Absolut the other night
[SPEAKER_25]: talking about that.
[SPEAKER_25]: And so we're going to make that the theme
of the cup this year is the cannabis POWs
[SPEAKER_25]: and how to really start supporting them.
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, they've got to pay for their own,
their beds, their own.
[SPEAKER_25]: People don't realize it's almost like a
third world country.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's where you got to pay for everything.
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't get anything in prison anymore.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's just one part of it.
[SPEAKER_25]: But then we've got the regenerative
farming, you know, with Dragonfly and
[SPEAKER_25]: Jesse Dodd and everybody leading the way
with living soils.
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, that's become a very
popular theme.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a very needed theme.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to have all this traditional
large scale farming throughout the Salinas
[SPEAKER_25]: Valley and the San Joaquin Valley coming
on.
[SPEAKER_25]: And most of it's contaminated,
toxic wasteland.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to need to have people like
Dragonfly and Jesse and, you know,
[SPEAKER_25]: Jeremy Plume, everybody.
[SPEAKER_25]: They come in and lead the way to teach
these people how to remediate that soil
[SPEAKER_25]: and bring it back to life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank God cannabis is such an
incredible bioremediation plant and can
[SPEAKER_05]: pull so many toxic things out of the soil,
including, we'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we focus on the soil is because
we know the plant is so powerful and so
[SPEAKER_07]: magical that if we can just build the most
intelligent, you know, natural indigenous
[SPEAKER_07]: soils that we can, then it's going to give
us our best medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then also goes full circle with what
we were just talking about.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we know and we have the science
on how to remediate soils.
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we not remediating our bodies in
the same way?
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we not looking towards as a larger
cultured towards the higher intelligence
[SPEAKER_19]: of microbiology to do the remediation for
us?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, as above so below.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to really go into the minds of the
beneficials and remediation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And ally with them because there's so many
of them and they are so important to us
[SPEAKER_07]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: And like Marcus said on the last one,
we are them as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it just hires our intelligence in a
more holistic view.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we named our strain Zellie's gift
after our friend Zellie and Gina,
[SPEAKER_07]: who went to jail for three years for a
cannabis related event and came out and
[SPEAKER_07]: started working with cannabis because
everything is like open now and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a ridiculous system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just want to free it up and just
make it something that we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we appreciate your work.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can take it and turn it into a positive
thing for our environment because cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: already makes the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a remediator, just growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we grow cannabis the right way,
then we're just going to be remediating
[SPEAKER_07]: land all over the place and remediating
minds along with humans, which is a big
[SPEAKER_25]: thing.
[SPEAKER_25]: Go ahead, Tim.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it's amazing that you look at these
practices of commercial agriculture and
[SPEAKER_25]: what they've done to the land.
[SPEAKER_25]: We would never be allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_25]: They're asking us to live at a bar that's
so high, but we're up to it.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we can teach them how to do that
because it really goes back into what
[SPEAKER_25]: they're saying about our minds and bodies.
[SPEAKER_25]: You look at the pharmaceuticals,
you look at the antibiotics, what they're
[SPEAKER_25]: poisoning us with, and they're dumbing us
down and making us a very docile bunch of
[SPEAKER_25]: people that just go along with zombies.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm trying to think of how you could say
that without really putting them down.
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, they're zombifying us.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we need to remediate our minds and our
bodies as much as the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a big reason why we created the
Pure certification.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at Pure certified farmers
that are out there like Jesse Dodd and so
[SPEAKER_07]: many more, there's a list of them on our
website.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can look up.
[SPEAKER_19]: We went beyond the organic certification.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's new farms all over the place right
now that are just growing food and growing
[SPEAKER_07]: flowers and producing medicine that's
totally free of any toxins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really, really beautiful what
Pure certified farming is really doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And more and more people are jumping on
board.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that we created this because we
are so pissed off with the organic
[SPEAKER_19]: certifications that are going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something we're not really interested in
because they aren't remediating the soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: There isn't a focus on remediation.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a focus on what you can get away
with.
[SPEAKER_16]: And 30% of organic produce has still
detected pesticides on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're allowed to have up to 5% of the
EPA allowed limit of that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_16]: So like 50 to 100 part per billion of,
you know, plethora of different pesticides
[SPEAKER_16]: are allowed on and often passed into the
market labeled as organic because that's,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's like gnarly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think about cannabis, you know,
and, you know, we've, we've, we've talked
[SPEAKER_16]: about this, uh, you know, kind of a
previous shows and stuff, but it's just so
[SPEAKER_16]: fascinating how this is about to be the
most regulated crop in the history of,
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and from that regulation,
it's going to uproot these really dirty
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of secrets of this, you know,
green revolution practice of some,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, just mass deploying,
spraying pesticides, herbicides,
[SPEAKER_16]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_16]: And from that, it's going to make it so
people are almost unable to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_16]: But from that, it's also going to empower,
you know, those that are of the most
[SPEAKER_16]: passion and understanding and how to do
it, like, right.
[SPEAKER_16]: But mimicking nature, you know,
beat biomimicry, you know, and for,
[SPEAKER_16]: for us, you know, and for the farmers to
like learn that way forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's almost going to provide the
model for anybody that's trying to create
[SPEAKER_16]: clean medicine, whether that's a vegetable
or, or a plant they're growing.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, it's the only way at,
at this point, you know, when the
[SPEAKER_16]: environment's so dirty.
[SPEAKER_19]: Through education.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the more that we can educate
people and also just showing people the
[SPEAKER_19]: flowers that can be grown with
regenerative farming and just closed loop
[SPEAKER_19]: systems.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the terpenes are higher.
[SPEAKER_19]: The cannabinoids are higher.
[SPEAKER_19]: The medicine is cleaner.
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a better, true medicine for patients
that, you know, are really needing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Or, I mean, I just don't really separate
the difference between, you know,
[SPEAKER_19]: medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe that it's all medical because
I think that all of us humans need help
[SPEAKER_19]: here on the planet right now with the
toxins.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: Even if it's recreational, people don't
want to be exposing themselves to,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, endocrine disrupting pesticides,
you know, even if they're allowed on food.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to bring up to mind that are
people eating Big Macs that they probably,
[SPEAKER_16]: if they don't want to smoke weed with
cannabis or with, with pesticides,
[SPEAKER_16]: it should probably check the diet too.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of weed with pesticides over
the years, Alec.
[SPEAKER_25]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_25]: Nobody knew, you know, all these failed
tests that were coming up with USC labs
[SPEAKER_25]: and now showing exactly some of the,
not the best practices people have done,
[SPEAKER_25]: but boy, I'm so proud of all the people
coming to the cup, like you guys,
[SPEAKER_25]: you and Josh and Jesse and everybody else
just teaching and educating people.
[SPEAKER_25]: Cause that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's about educating people up.
[SPEAKER_25]: We have no idea how many of these failed
concentrates were coming through.
[SPEAKER_25]: Now let's talk about these new,
very strict state regulations coming in.
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll finally get to the point where none
of this will be allowed to be sold in the
[SPEAKER_25]: black market for a little while,
but not in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pesticides, big problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: People realizing that they, that they're
getting, that these things are like
[SPEAKER_05]: passing on through the clones is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Failing concentrates and flowers passing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just some next level shit right
there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And coming in off the sources that they're
carting in.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, you know, buying $150 cheaper kind
of source of compost per, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: per yard or whatever.
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of a sudden, you know,
you might have whatever it's like,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's knowing all your sources,
you know, the whole supply chain
[SPEAKER_16]: management of like, yeah, what you're
doing and why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to see how much studies that
actually showed how much is carried on
[SPEAKER_15]: from a little tiny clone to the next
generation, to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also make seeds from the plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it carry on through the seed also?
[SPEAKER_16]: I think so much of it too is just the UV
spectrum, you know, cause like we,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, if the same plant was grown
outdoor versus indoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: depending on the lighting, it's under
indoor, but like on moms, when people will
[SPEAKER_16]: spray like systemic pesticides on a mother
plant that then, you know, vegging,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, under, you know, whatever 18
hours light indoor kind of under metal
[SPEAKER_16]: halide or high pressure sodium,
whatever type of lighting.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then which is void at UVA, B or C,
you know, oftentimes we can see up to a
[SPEAKER_16]: year after that, you know, kind of plant
has been sprayed.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still showing up, you know,
on the clones, but people are just cutting
[SPEAKER_16]: clones off of this mother.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just dirty.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there's no UV.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's never breaking down or it's slowly
breaking down.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, whenever people are taking
clones off of clones of clones,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, you can see it kind of slowly be
able to get out of the plant stock,
[SPEAKER_16]: but it takes some time.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, but I think it is a much faster
process whenever it's done under the sun.
[SPEAKER_15]: And under glass, you don't have UVB
either.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in greenhouses, it wouldn't burn away
as fast as it would outdoors, for example.
Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: how's the Harlequin back in the house?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, two House of Harlequins.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of trippy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've been rocking along for three
hours and five minutes on our episode 156,
[SPEAKER_05]: which at least two people have been like,
it's not the three year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, listen, there's 52 weeks in a
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is episode 156.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing simple math.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if we started on September
28th.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today is the three year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's because 153, you did it
twice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, did I?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then you fixed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do my wake and bake shows every morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I forget what number I'm on all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it kind of makes it part of the
fun that I just, it's like, I think I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: in, I need more alpha pining in my
cannabis extracts because yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit forgetful sometimes as to
what, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Little alpha pining for focus.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: D helps to decrease the negative memory
impairment effects that THC has in short
[SPEAKER_16]: term.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspect that prohibition somehow
inadvertently squeezed out a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: alpha pining and it created the stereotype
of the stoner who can't remember things.
[SPEAKER_05]: When really it's just simply a terpene
missing from your profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what kind of, I was going to say,
is that why you feel so happy when there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a Christmas tree in the house?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely why I feel so happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the feeling of clearing my head and
walking through a giant old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's definitely some serious pine
in the air when that's happening.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, from our findings with the terpene
aggregation of kind of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_16]: terpene data that we've tested for,
we see that one of the distinct primary
[SPEAKER_16]: groupings or clusters is this alpha pining
near scene relationship.
[SPEAKER_16]: And oftentimes like you can see it just
straight dominance alpha pining with near
[SPEAKER_16]: scene like a third as much of the other as
the pining, but overall the near scene
[SPEAKER_16]: primary set of all the samples that we've
tested is by far the smallest
[SPEAKER_16]: representation of samples that we see.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's interesting because I mean,
near scene is obviously the largest group
[SPEAKER_16]: with its different subgroups in
combinations of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then terpenoline is on the other side,
which is all the Jacks, trainwrecks,
[SPEAKER_16]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the alpha pining group is really kind
of almost rare, super rare from the total
[SPEAKER_16]: amount of samples that we've ever tested.
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be as simple as, near scene is a
potentiator besides many of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_15]: are modulators, but not necessarily much
of a potentiator.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're going to go towards the
compounds, which are potentiators plus
[SPEAKER_15]: modulators for whatever particular effect
they're after.
[SPEAKER_15]: The three big potentials are limolene,
pining.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sam you say limonene and pining.
[SPEAKER_15]: All three of those are potentiators and
modulators also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that would be, it would be
interesting to see how pining became so
[SPEAKER_05]: rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it had something to do with,
I just feel like prohibition and the way
[SPEAKER_05]: we were forced to grow underground and the
way greed took a hold and people wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: flower short, short flowering cultivars
that gave large vegetative weights.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that something in that
mechanism cut out, like pining was like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also too, it's like, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say snow cap.
[SPEAKER_16]: People started mass cultivating snow cap
and then blue dream too.
[SPEAKER_16]: And blue dream is kind of a pining
secondary, but it's funny from the mass
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of cultivation of those people and
was super bailed on ever growing something
[SPEAKER_16]: that smell like those again.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, that's just a silly aside,
but the dream is to blame.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are growing an Acapulco gold right now
from Bodhi seeds and we have two plants of
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is one of the craziest plants we've
ever grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely by far.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just been going on and on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the most amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wonder if the alpha pining,
maybe Sam would know something more about
[SPEAKER_07]: this, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that maybe it's more in land race
cultivars that people just shy away from
[SPEAKER_07]: because they're so crazy and weird.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't form the perfect bud.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's happened with land races is in
different areas of the world, they craved
[SPEAKER_15]: strong cannabis, of course, number one,
but they also, some of them might crave
[SPEAKER_15]: particular tastes, particular smells,
particular effects.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why all around the world,
every cannabis had different smells,
[SPEAKER_15]: flavors, and it was primarily from the
selection by the growers of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_15]: because they all had THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they had a little bit of other
cannabinoids, but really recreational
[SPEAKER_15]: ganja was primarily THC with different
terpenes worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're growing a Moroccan from the
Chef Chawan area that has an incredibly
[SPEAKER_07]: high noted, really amazing pining,
but it's not exactly pining, but I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really high note.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get them tested and then keep it alive and
you'll see exactly what you got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and we had our family members go to
Sri Lanka last winter and we have seeds
[SPEAKER_07]: from Sri Lanka that we're growing at this
moment and flowering and some Northern
[SPEAKER_07]: Thai from Chiang Mai last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Northern Thai hermed on us and
that was another issue with the land race.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Thai cannabis in general has a
tendency to be very hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_15]: carrying intersex traits because in
Thailand, think about it, they're trying
[SPEAKER_15]: to grow simsamia.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they grow in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you don't get every little male,
meaning intersex plant, then that means
[SPEAKER_15]: they're made from a male, they're made
from an intersex male.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what that causes is every year a
higher and higher and higher load in the
[SPEAKER_15]: gene pool of intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what in Thai, I'd say 90% of
the plants have ever grown male flowers on
[SPEAKER_15]: the female plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was amazingly true for what we
found in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was super healthy, really grew very
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hard to find seeds up there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we found it from a good source,
a good family that cared and got seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: And definitely what we're noticing is I
think that that alpha pining and some of
[SPEAKER_19]: those terpenes that make us feel really
good and not forgetful might be found in
[SPEAKER_19]: some of those land races and maybe the way
that we've been cultured.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look in South Africa, if I remember
correctly, it was high and tiny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to grow some of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love that you guys have all these
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, it was amazing when it first
sort of happened, the internet,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis groups, trading seeds,
but it has gotten so crazy at this point
[SPEAKER_05]: in time that genetics from all over the
world are everywhere all over the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not just where they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: One greenhouse with 80 different plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: One greenhouse with 80 different plants of
80 seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was also kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a plus side and the negative side
to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if you wanted to go to Thailand and
collect pure Thai seeds, you might be able
[SPEAKER_15]: to find them.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to go to Mexico or you want to
go to Jamaica or you want to go to Morocco
[SPEAKER_15]: and collect pure land races, good luck.
[SPEAKER_15]: In Morocco, everything is hybridized with
Western genetics.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that in what we have that it's
not pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that it's not pure,
but it is an early finisher.
[SPEAKER_07]: It finishes early and it's really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_15]: I first visited Morocco was 1971 and they
had just switched over for less than 10
[SPEAKER_15]: years from teeth growing just for
marijuana, which they would chop up,
[SPEAKER_15]: remove the sticks and seeds, chop it up
with black tobacco and smoke it in their
[SPEAKER_15]: little SIMC pipes.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they had switched over and in 71,
they had been producing hash for maybe
[SPEAKER_15]: five, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And everything there, Morocco can keep
plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was nothing else at that time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now reports from people who visit there
say you don't see any plants like that
[SPEAKER_15]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: They've all been hybridized because
everything in Morocco has grown seeded,
[SPEAKER_15]: which means every year it gets pollinated
and genes spread incredibly fast and easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it in 1965 that some dude named
Mustafa went with Lebanese screen
[SPEAKER_05]: technique to Morocco?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that is what we were told by a
Moroccan family.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as I know, that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's kind of that because people
are like, oh, they've been making hash in
[SPEAKER_05]: Morocco for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's absolutely not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting to see, like even in our
own community, how like a lot of these
[SPEAKER_05]: histories aren't known.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping Chris Bennett was going to
pop in today because he's always good for
[SPEAKER_05]: some cannabis history lessons.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: He uses history running out his ears.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's really into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is full of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is full of good cannabis history
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's going to be exciting to hear
about the Emerald Cup this year,
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that tons of people are excited for
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be sort of the big one that
everyone waits for each year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know every year that it comes up,
I feel bummed out to not be down there,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm hoping Tony and crew is going to
represent at the at the cup this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, come check, you know,
maybe make some videos because we never
[SPEAKER_05]: see enough of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The experience is almost like a Dave
Chappelle show from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: where he's like, take put your phones
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody take.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never see like videos of people,
you know, like putting out because I've
[SPEAKER_05]: never experienced the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea the experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people on stage and I've seen
photos of the bud entries, but I've never
[SPEAKER_05]: actually experienced it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Tim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony's going to Tony's going to rep for
me.
[SPEAKER_25]: This year, we're going to get it all down.
[SPEAKER_25]: Two years in a row, we had some
challenges.
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know how it ended up.
[SPEAKER_25]: We had some challenges on the audio.
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that Eric there?
[SPEAKER_25]: But we had challenges with the audio and
some of the video and stuff.
[SPEAKER_25]: But in the past, we didn't film the
panels.
[SPEAKER_25]: This year, every panel will be brought in
and done right.
[SPEAKER_25]: We have an all star crew coming in to do
this.
[SPEAKER_25]: We made a new partnership with Red Light
Management.
[SPEAKER_25]: And so we brought in some really,
really talented people to run production
[SPEAKER_25]: and ops and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you're going to see all that this year,
right after the show.
[SPEAKER_25]: Every one of the panels and the whole
couple will just be brought to you.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we'll live stream quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_25]: And with the Cup, you know, we're just
amazed to see that we had over fifteen
[SPEAKER_25]: hundred requests for boots this year.
[SPEAKER_25]: In the past, we didn't we peaked out at
six hundred.
[SPEAKER_25]: So just in one year, we had another
thousand thousand companies that wanted to
[SPEAKER_25]: come in.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just been a daunting figure out
who not.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and I say this, I've said this.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just going to say I've said this
kind of, you know, kind of before on stage
[SPEAKER_16]: and to you, Tim.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I have the deepest respect
and props for especially you guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: But just for those putting on events,
because as when you're doing a cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: competition and event, you're you know,
there's two aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's like the vendor
coordination and sponsorship where
[SPEAKER_16]: everybody is like the biggest like VIP in
the room.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you got to like play.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want me.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then and then beyond that,
then your organ.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so people are pissed on this level,
you know, and you can only please people
[SPEAKER_16]: as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then also on the other side of it,
you're organizing a competition and to see
[SPEAKER_16]: like the Emerald Cup hit twelve hundred
entries across all categories.
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I mean, there were little
issues and hiccups.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I can't believe like just how much
logistical coordination and, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of goes into that pre-screen,
make sure everything's clean before it
[SPEAKER_16]: gets to judges.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and so, you know, each year just
get better and better.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's, you know, it's just amazing to
see how much it's grown.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it's been an honor to
participate in it for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_16]: I started working with the Emerald Cup,
you know, back in 2007.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was parking cars in the mud across
the street.
[SPEAKER_16]: Up at Tim's spot area 101.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's amazing to see the progress
and where it's come.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you've been there the whole way
through.
[SPEAKER_25]: And this year we've got Jane, your former
head contest person at SC Labs working
[SPEAKER_25]: full time with us just to make sure the
contest goes right.
[SPEAKER_25]: Dan helped us last year.
[SPEAKER_25]: Dan came in and realized this wasn't just
a musical event.
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a very complex event with contests
and speaker panels and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_25]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_25]: Dougie from Chalice has really done the
best he could to really step up and the
[SPEAKER_25]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_25]: None of us are really true production
people.
[SPEAKER_25]: The challenge was it is, is that now we
are expected to run a competition and an
[SPEAKER_25]: event the way it should be run.
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's why we paired it up with Red
Light because, you know, I can do shows
[SPEAKER_25]: for 1,500 people.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not used to doing shows for 3,000 and
complexities.
[SPEAKER_25]: And so we really, like I said,
brought in several key people.
[SPEAKER_25]: One of those being Jane.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we brought Dave Matthews, head of
security and ops for 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_25]: James Hathaway.
[SPEAKER_25]: We brought a guy named Spike from them.
[SPEAKER_25]: Dave Liston.
[SPEAKER_25]: Those guys do, like, design for Rolling
Stones and major shows.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we've just brought across the board in
people that can stand up to it because,
[SPEAKER_25]: you know, everybody deserves to have a
perfectly run show.
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that's what you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_25]: Last year we did have some challenges,
but this year we're excited to show people
[SPEAKER_25]: all the improvements.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Tim, you need to be congratulated for
the force that you put forward to try to
[SPEAKER_15]: encourage people to be truly organic and
not use chemical sprays.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's really important for the
future of cannabis and you deserve a
[SPEAKER_15]: strong...
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's such well put words too,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I apologize, Eric, just to make
one last point on that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, you know, three years ago,
you know, the Emerald Cup taking on the
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of, you know, the whole reality and
logistics and kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: pricing and money to like do comprehensive
pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really the first kind of splash in
the industry of awareness, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: on some level of public kind of display
that, you know, people entering had
[SPEAKER_16]: pesticides in their shit and it brought up
so much unknown issues that people had of
[SPEAKER_16]: having dirty machines or having residual
contaminants in their soil or what have
you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, just before regulations
kind of which are now so quickly coming
[SPEAKER_16]: about, you know, for the past few years,
you know, the Emerald Cup and Chalice,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, kind of...
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, Emerald Cup most
specifically kind of just set these
[SPEAKER_16]: ripples throughout the entire industry of
everybody who thought they're the,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, most OG grower there is,
you know, and it's just like these little
[SPEAKER_16]: checks, you know, that resonated through.
[SPEAKER_16]: And from that, you know, have really
evolved a tremendous amount of,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, solid growers to become these
amazing farmers.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, big ups to you,
Tim, and everything that you've helped to
[SPEAKER_16]: bring forward cleaning people's practices.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, that's been people like you,
Eric from Forever Flowering, Josh and
[SPEAKER_25]: Kelly, everybody coming in and really
helping out.
[SPEAKER_25]: It really becomes a whole new generation.
[SPEAKER_25]: Eric!
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Eric was muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he needs to unmute his mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walking outside.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just out here at the family farm.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's walnut season, so I'm down here with
my kid checking out the walnut harvest.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm trying to find a dry, quiet place
to be out here in the orchard,
[SPEAKER_17]: but it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like you were in some beautiful
orchard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't tell what they were,
but that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's a walnut season, so it goes on
for about a month.
[SPEAKER_17]: My family custom harvests and does a lot
of other harvesting for other farms around
[SPEAKER_17]: here, so it's quite the operation and it's
fun to bring the kid down and visit for a
[SPEAKER_17]: minute.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was watching Hash Church on the drive
down here, so I wanted to say hello and
[SPEAKER_17]: chime in and say congratulations on this
three-year run you've had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started out as a spur of the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no agenda for Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of YouTube sent me a link
saying, hey, you can now stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I set it all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to open this Google Plus thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden, they gave me a link
and I put it on my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first Hash Church was just people
who follow me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that turned into sort of a panel of
people that grew into a panel of many,
[SPEAKER_05]: many people, which kind of grew into what
it is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Tim, it's much bigger than anything I
really started.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all the people sort of grabbed
hold of it and said, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a good sort of mechanism for us to
use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a blessing since day one,
all the amazing people that it's brought
[SPEAKER_05]: into my life and the people who are
watching who tell us consistently,
[SPEAKER_05]: listen, this information was not available
in this format ever before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't understand like you guys are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these people, all these
perspectives and people that know their
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just not really high level,
high level of information, recall and
[SPEAKER_05]: articulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having it come out in this beautiful way,
a dialogue that involves people
[SPEAKER_05]: disagreeing sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We enjoy that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the most part, everyone on point
for the same agenda, which is to move
[SPEAKER_05]: forward access for all people,
rather preventative, medicinal or
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational adult use, whatever you want
to call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want cannabis to be normalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want it to be available.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want it to be inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't want it to be in any way,
shape or form capped because I don't think
[SPEAKER_05]: we cap any other agricultural product
currently in our agricultural system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why would we cap cannabis with numbers,
weights, THC, levels, any of these other
[SPEAKER_05]: worries sometimes?
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we want it to be proprietary
or a secret or, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_17]: different levels people trying to put at
it because I was just speaking at an event
[SPEAKER_17]: Friday in LA and it's just like people
wanting to get into this industry and they
[SPEAKER_17]: don't know where to go, who to listen to.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a million consultants.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a million shows to go to.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's got a booth and it's just
like, where does someone want to throw a
[SPEAKER_17]: few plants in their backyard?
[SPEAKER_17]: Not even just turn commercial.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, it's really crazy how the
industry is growing so much and yet
[SPEAKER_17]: there's not enough info for people to get
out there or they just don't know where to
[SPEAKER_17]: go to get it.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I always tell people to tune into Hash
Church, go to the Golden Tarp,
[SPEAKER_17]: go to the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's only about three or four things I
can think of that people can really go get
[SPEAKER_17]: their feet wet and meet real growers and
meet real people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, it's kind of a crap shoot out
there.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what, Eric, you go to so many
events between you and Alec.
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys just cover the whole country.
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know how you guys get around so
much and even see your families.
[SPEAKER_17]: My wife's going to kill me.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: As he's hiding out in the orchard on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: We love you, Bridget.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're thinking about you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I got to have her check this out
because, yeah, I mean, I'm down here
[SPEAKER_17]: visiting the family farm, but I'm sneaking
off to do Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_16]: We love this plant spirit, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I started cannabis down here at
this very farm.
[SPEAKER_17]: My family moved here in 1862 from Norway
and started this property that I'm
[SPEAKER_17]: standing at.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my first cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's all good to come home.
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, the family isn't too much
into the movement like I am, but it's
[SPEAKER_17]: still part of farming and agriculture and
it's in my blood.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just got to go sneak around to puff
still like the old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about that feels kind of unique
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just... It's kind of like a gorilla.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to take a little solace,
puff, give thanks.
[SPEAKER_19]: Away from your family.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a couple years ago, I was in
Winnipeg where I was born and spent the
[SPEAKER_05]: first 22 years of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was at my mom's house and I was
like, oh, I'm going to walk down the
[SPEAKER_05]: street.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I'm walking down the street,
I'm like, I look at this store that's
[SPEAKER_05]: about a block away from her house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember, wow, that's where I smoked
my first joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was 14 years old, behind this
store, crouched down behind the BFI can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course, I've got like a torch,
a rig, a camera, a tripod.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm just walking down the street
and this is the shit I always have on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I film it for my channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually on YouTube where I had a
couple of dabs at this BFI can and just
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about the absurdity of a 14 year
old boy, you know, coming to with cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: as this unique lifelong relationship that
starts next to a BFI can behind a corner
[SPEAKER_05]: store bodega.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just... It just seemed so
ridiculous to be back there and just like
[SPEAKER_05]: hitting dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was kind of a fun video that
reminded me of that feeling of where I
[SPEAKER_05]: smoked my first joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: That reminds me of one time when my kid
was small and I met your dad.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, next thing you know, there'll be
growing weed in your basement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He caught me growing weed in my basement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, was he pissed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just wanted to say congratulations
on three years running, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, a couple hundred more
years and you can cover it as history.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hopefully we all come up with some
more technological advancements.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can all be around for a couple hundred
more years covering the old history right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nanotechnology, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you read Radical Abundance by
what's his name there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric K Drexler, the guy that wrote Engines
of Creations and coined the nanotechnology
[SPEAKER_05]: term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have been going through all sorts
of chemical material the last couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: years while I'm working on this book and
lots of claims there about elixirs of
[SPEAKER_06]: immortality and stuff like that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enemies have a long history with
longevity, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, going back to ancient Chinese
Taoist claims and stuff like that was one
[SPEAKER_06]: of the original elixirs of immortality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And same in medieval Hindu texts.
[SPEAKER_06]: They associate it with longevity and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Phoola Nayak, the oldest woman who
ever lived, claimed, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: allegedly to her like 127 or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's different debates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people claim the title as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But she smoked weed every day and
attributed her long life to that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, it's antioxidant and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's something there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I definitely have people on the
consistent tell me I look younger than I
[SPEAKER_05]: am.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tell them, well, I don't drink
alcohol and I don't smoke cigarettes and I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't really do coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to eat less sugar, but I do eat
sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Chris, I've wanted I've wanted to ask
you this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so glad that the conversation
went this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think that the fountain of youth
that Ponce de Leon actually was looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, well, you know, it's I haven't
read like that particular I know of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I haven't really gone in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And research that particular guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a whole scene like Rabelais,
for instance, who encoded three chapters
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis as the Herb Pantagruelian into
his famous epic and parody of the Grail
[SPEAKER_06]: myth, Gargantuan Pantagruel.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they find the holy bottle in a
bubbling fountain, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's kind of like a connection
there to that whole fountain of
[SPEAKER_06]: immortality.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, you know, you take a look
at some of this, the claims in history and
[SPEAKER_06]: then some of the science for rediscovering
that there might be something in there in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis that, you know, is going to aid
us in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly looking that way for the brain,
at least, you know, with all this stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: coming out about Alzheimer's and dementia
and stuff like that cannabis, that is
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly brain medicine and increasing
the longevity of the brain and the way of
[SPEAKER_02]: extending life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, for simple native peoples,
I mean, this must have been just like this
[SPEAKER_02]: panacea of, oh, my God, it's nutrition,
it's health, it's the cures, it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: antiseptics, it's everything that our body
needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, the big search in alchemy
was the elixir of immortality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found references that I had
translated out of Latin from alchemists
[SPEAKER_06]: going as far back as Zosimos in the 4th
century.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis infused wines, cannabis infused
beverages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paracelsus had an arcanum, which is like a
secret elixir that was infused with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and other substances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cardano, another famous alchemist,
had a cannabis infused elixir.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these guys definitely had,
you know, some idea about its effects and
[SPEAKER_06]: its use and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are just what I could find,
you know, that's where clearly where
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis appears in Latin.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So quite definitive references.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of what these guys did, they did in
secret, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's funny when you start really
looking at even like the grail mythology,
[SPEAKER_06]: the grail has that kind of symbolism.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole grail mythology is totally
intertwined with Heyoma and Soma,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Indian and Persian drakes,
particularly through the Persian region.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where these myths of the grail
actually start is in the Mideast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all intertwined with the Hashishines
and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this is connected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, there's been claims out
there, an Italian doctor's written a book
[SPEAKER_06]: on medieval medicine, and he claimed that
the Templars had an elixir of Jerusalem
[SPEAKER_06]: that contained cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wasn't able to find references to
that, but I went back to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the source material from the time
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I went back to Latin material from the
time period of the Templars' arrest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were, there was cannabis seized
at a number of Templar sites.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's listed on the items that were seized.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Latin word cannabis is used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had Saracens, Arabic people,
growing cannabis for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't get Arabic people to grow
cannabis for fiber purposes in that
[SPEAKER_06]: region.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't specialized in that at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were people that knew about growing
cannabis resins, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is, you know, increasing evidence
that there was a lot going on with that
[SPEAKER_06]: time, especially when we take a look at
Rabelais.
[SPEAKER_06]: A number of Dante scholars have suggested
Dante was using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's some really interesting
material from this time period.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it's, you know, you would have
to, speculation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there's a lot of really solid
material, actual references to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: and alchemy, and the magical grimoires
that are quite fascinating and really open
[SPEAKER_06]: up the discussion in these areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the history.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been on the show for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been digging into that, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just before you came in,
we were talking about different things
[SPEAKER_05]: about the history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, we need to get Chris
Benedict in here dropping a little history
[SPEAKER_05]: on us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it occurred.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happened just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm so happy that the show's still
going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three years is a real accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just wanted to pop in and say hello to
everybody, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jobless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, jobless.
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome to Selena, who just popped
into the room while Chris was giving us
[SPEAKER_05]: some history lessons there.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Selena?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mic's not coming through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it happens like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have to reboot your whole unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does happen like that, the odd time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully Peter comes in from Soil Balance
Pro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sent him off the link as well today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to just get a variety of people
letting us know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: All like Alex said, high level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love what all of you are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of makes me want to get on a
plane and be able to go to each and every
[SPEAKER_05]: little event and thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be in the orchard right now with
Eric.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be in the greenhouse with Josh
and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be at the Emerald Cup for
certain.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the dates on that Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a December or a November?
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's a day, a night.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to be Saturday, Sunday.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to have some great music
announced in the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's really, like I said, there's so
many things that I look forward to.
[SPEAKER_25]: But a lot of the educational, it's like
Josh is saying it's the education that we
[SPEAKER_25]: need to bring in.
[SPEAKER_25]: Eric, Alec, Josh, all these people
teaching people about the various things,
[SPEAKER_25]: how important those local audiences,
you guys were talking about that earlier,
[SPEAKER_25]: local ordinances, and all these cities are
coming on.
[SPEAKER_25]: We just passed some ordinances in Willis
the other day.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have some amazing speakers.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to film it all, get it up so
you can see it out there, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're going to have Eric come in and
do some stuff, Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're going to have so many entries.
[SPEAKER_25]: We've expanded the contest.
[SPEAKER_25]: Every year we bring in something new.
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, next year we'll bring in,
we'll probably open up all forms of
[SPEAKER_25]: extracts, as Alec has been saying for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, California has approved it.
[SPEAKER_25]: The cities are all approving it.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's coming on next year.
[SPEAKER_25]: As long as we get down the PPMs,
then we're going to add that into the
[SPEAKER_25]: contest, too.
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's my most excited and
forward-looking show I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_25]: I never thought I'd say each year would be
something else.
[SPEAKER_25]: But this year, I just really want to go
back and show people that we really
[SPEAKER_25]: learned and we really raised that bar,
even more, and bring this stuff in.
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, who would have thought about
regenerative farming a couple years ago?
[SPEAKER_25]: It was so important, but people weren't
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_25]: Rozin, who even knew about Rozin a few
years ago?
[SPEAKER_25]: And now every year you bring something
else in.
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I'm excited to see all these
companies we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got one acre of tents.
[SPEAKER_25]: We've added in an acre of tent with
flooring.
[SPEAKER_25]: Our tent, just for that to add on.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to have 600-plus vendors there
and sponsors.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't even imagine all the stuff you
guys are going to see to walk around and
[SPEAKER_25]: be part of.
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we've added on a yoga and
meditation area.
[SPEAKER_25]: Every time I turn around, there's
something else that we put in there.
[SPEAKER_25]: But like I said, it takes the
collaboration of all these people.
[SPEAKER_25]: Eric, remember, flooring coming in and
helping us.
[SPEAKER_25]: Dragonfly bringing in their teepees and
their tea house.
[SPEAKER_25]: Alec and SC Labs coming in and teaching
everybody.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's so many of them that come in and
add to it.
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got professional people running it
all.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I can actually participate.
[SPEAKER_25]: Last year, we got overwhelmed with so many
people coming in.
[SPEAKER_25]: I spent my whole day just getting all the
extra people in that couldn't get into the
[SPEAKER_25]: show.
[SPEAKER_25]: So I spent seven, eight hours on Saturday
getting almost 500 people into the event
[SPEAKER_25]: that were begging.
[SPEAKER_16]: You were walking people in the side
backstage just to sneak more people in.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_25]: I go back to get five really important
VIPs.
[SPEAKER_25]: There'd be 20 people begging to come in,
and I would just drag them all in.
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, we got kind of in trouble with
the fairgrounds on that.
[SPEAKER_25]: Excellent work.
[SPEAKER_25]: This year, I want to go to the speakers
and panels.
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to go hang out with all these
people, and that's what I'm excited about,
[SPEAKER_25]: is to really take in this myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're excited to be next to Eric and next
to Forever Flowering and having the teepee
[SPEAKER_07]: next to Forever Flowering and having the
lounge we've had Tony in our teepee with
[SPEAKER_07]: Trixie before.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been sessioning out Blue Terps in
the teepee.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Highlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Cuban Grower is in the chat room
saying he's ready to judge again.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's ready to spend a month in the 101
smoking hash and writing notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: His services are available.
[SPEAKER_25]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_25]: Eric's going to be with us.
[SPEAKER_25]: The concentrates have become a bigger and
bigger part of the concert contest.
[SPEAKER_25]: It was really just a flowers contest when
we started.
[SPEAKER_25]: Now you've got hundreds of entries on the
concentrate side.
[SPEAKER_25]: The cartridge is coming in, distillates
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_25]: We need really master judges like that,
and we're fortunate that we get people to
[SPEAKER_25]: really... They don't really get paid.
[SPEAKER_25]: They come up and do their own time.
[SPEAKER_25]: We get them rooms and bring them into the
show, but they spend a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_25]: effort coming in and judging, and people
like Cuban and Nick from Happy Trees and
[SPEAKER_25]: Swami and Nikki.
[SPEAKER_25]: We have over 50 judges now, and they come
in, do an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm looking forward to seeing Cuban there
this year and being back at every 101.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the one thing I get to do is hang
out with the judges and watch him get high
[SPEAKER_25]: and participate myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like it's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure, if you have videos that are done
at the end of it, I'll gladly post any
[SPEAKER_05]: that you want on my channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should get some views.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys have a dual channel,
we can put it up as a collaboration so it
[SPEAKER_05]: links people to your channel.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I was going to say, you should come
down to the Hash Church down there.
[SPEAKER_25]: I've done some live Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be up here, unfortunately,
but I could have someone down there from
[SPEAKER_05]: the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do it on our TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash Church and the TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited now.
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim, this is Wade, Wade Lafter.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to be over to see Nikki and
Swami at Turtle Creek on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_22]: I wondered if you were going to be in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_22]: I could find you.
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm going to be down with Eric.
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, another one in advance down at
Salinas.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm representing down there with a bunch
of filming at SC Labs on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be back up until Thursday.
[SPEAKER_25]: I keep missing you though, Wade.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd love to see you.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right back at you, man.
[SPEAKER_25]: Been too long.
[SPEAKER_25]: Another one of those elders that's really
led the way and we can all look up to.
[SPEAKER_25]: Great work you've done over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Hilary said it's been 10 years since
we took our little trip together,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ridiculous to have a friend that
close and that good that you don't spend
[SPEAKER_05]: time with for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shame on me.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, Wade.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wade, I had a quick thing to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw you on the Swami, smoking with
Swami, and you were talking about when you
[SPEAKER_07]: were developing the Harlequin and how you
had your pots grounded and you used
[SPEAKER_07]: grounding in your soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really liked that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked that movie, Grounded.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you can heal yourself by laying naked
on the earth like 20 minutes a day,
[SPEAKER_07]: even if you're in Alaska or whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now the consulting that we do,
we incorporate that.
[SPEAKER_19]: We just wanted to thank you for that and
really makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're really excited to sit down with you
and smoke a joint together and hang out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're headed down your way.
[SPEAKER_22]: In December, we've got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a nice year.
[SPEAKER_22]: Come visit.
[SPEAKER_22]: That grounding thing was really about
trying to understand what indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_22]: plants were wanting.
[SPEAKER_22]: That fellow, his name escapes me at the
moment, Brad, who made reference to a
[SPEAKER_22]: specific type of lighting that closely
mimicked the sun.
[SPEAKER_22]: I knew Gerald Garrison, the fellow he
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was using his lighting, actually.
[SPEAKER_22]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the closest I had ever found that
actually mimicked sunlight.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd gone to the extent of trying to
identify what indoor plants needed for
[SPEAKER_22]: lighting and water and food and soil media
and on and on and on, but I could still
[SPEAKER_22]: tell they weren't happy.
[SPEAKER_22]: They weren't all there.
[SPEAKER_22]: I heard from them that they were lonely.
[SPEAKER_22]: I realized that they had evolved in the
earth and I had disconnected them from the
[SPEAKER_22]: earth by putting them up on raised tables
so they were easy to work on and not
[SPEAKER_22]: giving them any sort of connectivity,
if you will, to the earth.
[SPEAKER_22]: That thing we call ground is just that
frequency of the earth reminding us of
[SPEAKER_22]: where we came from and the plants were cut
off from it.
[SPEAKER_22]: By giving them ground, they flourished.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was pretty dramatic, the difference.
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, that's why I'm going to go see
Nicky and Swami.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to reshoot the show.
[SPEAKER_22]: They've got better cameras and lighting in
the whole scene.
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be fun to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't seen them in more than a year,
so it'll be fun to be over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them love for us.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I look forward to smoking that joint with
you.
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim, what a treat to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're looking good.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, so are you.
[SPEAKER_25]: Nicky and Swami got remarried recently.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm looking forward to visiting with them,
going over tomorrow and have to get back
[SPEAKER_22]: Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to do the shoot Tuesday
morning and spend some time in the garden.
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be lovely, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll come down to the animal club.
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll get you in.
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll do a hash church and we'll bring us
back together.
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll go into Dragonfly's tent.
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll do it from there with a little man
up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_22]: I look forward to it, Tim.
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that idea as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, Selena.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the moment.
[SPEAKER_26]: The moment of truth.
[SPEAKER_26]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_26]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_26]: Happy three years.
[SPEAKER_26]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a wild ride, if you will.
[SPEAKER_05]: 156 Sundays in a row, never missed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Santa dabbing on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have driven through blizzards with
Rastafarians through Ontario to get to
[SPEAKER_05]: hash church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even explain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done hash church in Kingston,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I think, six countries so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't miss it, regardless.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done it yet at an airport.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've managed to maintain not flying on a
Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a good feat in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_26]: 156 Sundays in a row to commit to this
beautiful community, having awesome
[SPEAKER_26]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember years ago, it was three years
ago when Stephen, my friend and colleague,
[SPEAKER_26]: he was telling me about hash church and
just all that he's learned.
[SPEAKER_26]: I know he's been following and I've
learned so much from all the discussions
[SPEAKER_26]: that we've had here.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's huge, massively huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Stephen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stephen, actually, he helped link a lot of
the people that I gave invites to,
[SPEAKER_05]: made it easier for me to find their
Facebooks by just being able to go to his
[SPEAKER_05]: links and hash church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very good, very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck out family.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_26]: I wanted to say I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_26]: It was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't wait to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a little bit of the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the circular greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragonfly medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we got some flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks so serene out there.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for that.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: This experience though, hash church,
really big ups.
[SPEAKER_16]: To do this for 166 straight weeks,
for what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we all probably talk about cannabis
a lot, but to take it into this true
[SPEAKER_16]: reverence way to pay tribute to the plant,
the spirit, to bring together all the
[SPEAKER_16]: people that are so passionate about it and
know about it from so many different
[SPEAKER_16]: angles, it really is bringing this amazing
reverence to this plant in this
[SPEAKER_16]: church-like way.
[SPEAKER_16]: For those that are trying to come and
commune with this plant knowledge,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's like what better of a space and how
high level knowledge.
[SPEAKER_16]: It really is just helping evolve people's
awareness.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: While the integrity is high, we haven't
allowed any type of sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't created merchandise.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done any of that shit that
would inevitably turn this pool of
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge into a cesspool.
[SPEAKER_05]: As David Suzuki once said about his show,
The Nature of Things, I thought we were a
[SPEAKER_05]: real gem, but then I realized when you
throw a gem into a cesspool, it quickly
[SPEAKER_05]: takes on the appearance of everything else
in the cesspool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless of the gem that it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like to think we bitch slapped down
ignorance.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try our best.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a strangely offensive way of saying
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a hilarious fellow.
[SPEAKER_26]: I wanted to ask you a question,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_26]: For you, this is epic.
[SPEAKER_26]: How did this start?
[SPEAKER_26]: Where did you get the idea?
[SPEAKER_26]: Why Hash Church?
[SPEAKER_26]: Why did you decide to call it this and
create this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Hash Church started from kind of
part of my history, a Catholic church
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday school forced into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really my belief system at the time,
but I was like, all right, I'm a kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no other choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to go to Sunday school and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was always this Sunday association
with church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then as years went by, I opened a gallery
in Vancouver called the Melting Point
[SPEAKER_05]: Gallery in 2002 or 2003, which was one of
the it was the first vaporizer bar in
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the start of the vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were way ahead of our time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a big glass show with Marble Slinger
called Degenerate Art, and I had a raw
[SPEAKER_05]: food cafe that was 100 percent raw vegan,
macrobiotic, organic, like the whole nine
[SPEAKER_05]: yards, super high integrity, basically
zero profit in 2002.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's like way ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm about 10 years ahead of myself,
usually, and everything that I do,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I don't say as like a bragging
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks totally because you do you figure
something out and you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, I guess I'll just wait 10 years now
for it to manifest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the gallery manifested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And across the street, a good friend of
mine who was living in Turkey at the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: a Turkish fellow, a good friend of mine
named Amir, he was moving to Vancouver
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for places to open up a
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he ended up choosing across the street
from my place, which was 1111 Commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive, I&I and I&I.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually on a beach in Jamaica when
my friend called me up and said,
[SPEAKER_05]: I found your place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at I&I and I&I Commercial Drive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I literally just grabbed the place
without even looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Amir opened up his restaurant
across the street and it was called Rime,
[SPEAKER_05]: R-I-M-E, which was his name backwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: We became friends and I ended up going
over to his place and he would have this
[SPEAKER_05]: really comfortable area in the back that
we would gather on Sundays and we would
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke and we would talk and we would make
hash and we would help learn, educate from
[SPEAKER_05]: one another.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started calling it church like,
oh, I'll meet you at Amir's for church.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was this sort of smoking thing that
we did together and education thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when YouTube coincidentally one Sunday
morning at about 7am, sent me a YouTube
[SPEAKER_05]: email saying you have now reached a new
milestone as a YouTuber, you have to do
[SPEAKER_05]: all these things, gain followers,
get many millions of views, and then they
[SPEAKER_05]: allow you to do these different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that it said was you can
now stream live.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I wonder what this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went through it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I set it all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at the clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was nine o'clock in the morning
on a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I wrote Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just called it Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, this will be like like
Hash Church, like old church.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it'll be a new thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put the link up in my Facebook and just
strangers come in and share the first
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it eventually morphed into this panel
of people that are, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: deeply knowledgeable in this industry and
in this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of it just turned into it
was also another thing was me trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: turn my channel away from me and make it
more about like like use the traction of
[SPEAKER_05]: the channel instead of for personal gain
to try and make something bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, it was the most successful
thing that ever came out of my channel
[SPEAKER_05]: because of all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what about when you told me that you
climbed up to the top of that mountain and
[SPEAKER_15]: you found that tablet and it said,
you know, if it don't bubble, it ain't
[SPEAKER_15]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that that was lies to impress you
because I was so afraid of you at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little speechless there for a second.
[SPEAKER_25]: Marcus, being like that, you don't make
the money.
[SPEAKER_25]: You got to convince people.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know why it's what it's really a place
to go.
[SPEAKER_25]: And my props go to you so much for not
having the sponsorship, putting it all on
[SPEAKER_25]: your own, you know, vaporizers,
organic of it.
[SPEAKER_25]: Having been there myself, I realize what a
what a leadership role that is.
[SPEAKER_25]: And many props to you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_25]: You're young and for having all that under
your belt.
[SPEAKER_25]: I can imagine what you'll do in the next
20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very, very kind of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate all the all the kind words.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to share kind words with all of
you each and every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday and here for three year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do appreciate each and every one of you
for showing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to know we could go for another
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could go for another hour and five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really totally up to you guys and how much
time you want to spend.
[SPEAKER_26]: How's the celebration toke?
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyone down?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually I cleaned some dry sift the
other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was all one pile of dry sift.
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a single variety?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it many varieties?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it could be many varieties,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these guys grow, you know,
I don't know, some thousands of pounds or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love the different variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can see like some
contaminant there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The far one is really nasty contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally like stigma hairs and such
pile right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this pile right here is just heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it's much sandier and smoother
and a much different color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost like a brownish color compared to
the other greens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So love me some hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have a celebratory toke.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm smoking some Acapulco gold right now.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's grumbly destiny.
[SPEAKER_26]: Even when Kelly was saying that they were
growing some Acapulco gold, I was like,
[SPEAKER_26]: yes, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_26]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll show you one of my buds.
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if you guys can see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that looks pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I saw Acapulco gold,
it was from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how could I?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't forget his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eagle Bill, Eagle Bill, the true proponent
and educator of the vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_05]: which coincidentally enough, as I
mentioned, Eagle Bill, Samurai Sam comes
[SPEAKER_05]: in and Sam was working for Omnikron and
Uptac with Gary.
[SPEAKER_05]: He taught us all about on Hash Church
about the shitty pen vaporizers that have
[SPEAKER_05]: all the solder and the plastic and the
wires and this crap in behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good timing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just about to tell an Eagle Bill
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eagle Bill in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a booth next to him in 1995.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it would have been.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on one side and Jack Herr was on
the other side with his daughter signing
[SPEAKER_05]: and selling his books.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the time to be alive in the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you, it felt amazing at the
top floor of the PAX party house for the
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever annual Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Seventh or eighth?
[SPEAKER_05]: Annual Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam, was it the sixth maybe?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember which one, but I
certainly did enjoy the PAX party house,
[SPEAKER_15]: which was in this building as a police
neighborhood police station.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was another cool thing to show up as
a Canadian or an American, see a ton of
[SPEAKER_05]: cops parked out front and leaning up
against their cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just like, what the,
like, could they have found a club?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was literally next door to a
police station with not an inch between
[SPEAKER_05]: the buildings, just a wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've smashed through the wall and
there are the police on their computers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just, it was too much to handle.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were very practical and pot smokers
don't create problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they didn't even look at us with
negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the best thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't look at us like they hated us.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the thing from the North American
standpoint that was like, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: this fucking Amsterdam is a-okay in my
books.
[SPEAKER_05]: First thing is I can use cannabis and the
police don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for me anyway, so back to Eagle Bill,
he had grown some Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had sun dried it out on his balcony in
the summer and it was like gold,
[SPEAKER_05]: like bleached gold, gold, gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty wild to see that bud kind of
the way it was meant to be seen,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, from, from the historical
context of it being, is that not correct
[SPEAKER_05]: that they sun dried a lot of that bud and
it leached out all the color?
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_15]: They had so much that they did sun dry
most of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like they still do in America for hashish
making and most hashish countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right on for Eagle Bill for,
and that vaped like it was so divine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the smoothest like milkshake,
like just unbelievable smooth cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: vapor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget Eagle Bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've told the story before, but vaporizing
people out of this huge, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: heat gun vaporizer thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever it was that he had on his big
giant globe that he used to bring to the
[SPEAKER_05]: cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's vaporizing people and this guy,
it's a big glass rod and the guy's holding
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He takes a huge rip and he's just like
timber, like he goes over.
[SPEAKER_05]: He keeps holding the glass rod,
snapping it right out of, right out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: pipe, which didn't even phase bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he hits the ground and everyone's
like, it's the PAX party house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when someone faints or something
happens, everyone goes real quiet and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no sound and you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hear everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're all looking at the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm right next to bill at my booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking straight up at the guy
who's passed out now in front of my booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he's fallen over to that side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bill looks at everyone and he says,
you see, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_05]: the miraculous medicinal benefits of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This man hasn't slept in nine days and
after just one, Oh my God, everyone burst
[SPEAKER_05]: into laughter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the guy was now coming to,
and he was kind of hearing the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: joke and he wasn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was funny, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you Eagle bill had a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that on that day, he hit the like
hundred million dollar punchline.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I was going to pee my pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was saying it while he was pulling out
the broken piece of glass and replacing it
[SPEAKER_05]: without even like being phased.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all like a whole thing you had to
really experience, but you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We give props to Eagle bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the original vaporizer educators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bill used to also do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you've done it to a hundred or 200
people, it just doesn't surprise you
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_26]: So like in those instances, did they have
like a nice little space for someone to
[SPEAKER_26]: fall onto you blissfully and experience a
bunch of cactuses to try to teach people
[SPEAKER_05]: to be more careful?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam would put cactuses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's his style.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has the patent on that, but in reality,
I will tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would warn people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a combination of the smallness,
the warmth, how many people, the
[SPEAKER_05]: dehydration, the traveling, the time
difference, all of these things added up
[SPEAKER_05]: to this high rate of passing out because
I'm telling you at those cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_05]: I had six or seven or eight of them each
time, like each cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was only four or five days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was more than one a day.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought at one point of development,
the Europeans are used to mixing stuff
[SPEAKER_15]: with tobacco when they take pure hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were ignorant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't done out of malice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to you, I wasn't enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was not cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, the year that I knocked out
old Ed, that was the year it all changed
[SPEAKER_04]: for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt really bad.
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I've seen it and it kind of scares
the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_26]: A little bit, you know, like I can't
imagine that's like a fun experience for
[SPEAKER_16]: the person passing out and like,
well, oftentimes it'll make each other
[SPEAKER_16]: trips after that kind of slightly bad,
too.
[SPEAKER_16]: It can start to re reaffirm like a
negative framed response of it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it happens so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, not just at my booth,
at everyone's booth.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a combination of low blood pressure
and low blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm super high dose, you know,
CB1 receptor agony, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, like I said, I've learned
from those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's funny, too, because Tim,
Tim Blake blessed me up with my first
[SPEAKER_16]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, and I got two of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of them was this little wooden thing
with a little like tube, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: which they flowers.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever, you know, pretty controllable.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then there was this other device.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was called the essential vape.
[SPEAKER_16]: This thing was the craziest thing I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like this little metal piece.
[SPEAKER_16]: If any of you ever seen it, it's like
VAAP.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to say essential vape.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you screw a little like glass
kind of tube on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, so you fill the glass tube with
like hash oil or hash of some type.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just like pre dabbed tools or
people knowing low temp and all that other
[SPEAKER_16]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you'd load hashing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd screw this glass thing on and on
this little piece.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you like flame it with a torch
and then you take a rip off of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, for what it's worth,
you know, yeah, I a couple of my best
[SPEAKER_16]: friends I shared it with in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of them got turned off from
cannabis for quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I learned a huge lesson there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And my other buddy, he took a big rip off
of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, he like turned on his wife
for the rest of the night, thought she was
[SPEAKER_16]: a cop, like went super, super deep,
you know, and and, you know, and was like
[SPEAKER_16]: throwing up out of the window as they were
driving.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was this whole scene.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, but that really taught me a huge
lesson in responsibility of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_16]: But but this is also at a time when,
you know, everybody was just kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: stumbling upon figuring out, you know,
this whole process and way that you can
[SPEAKER_16]: essentially like vaporize or super burn
and combust huge amounts of hash oil and
[SPEAKER_16]: then, you know, hit it right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, those old heat gun where we took
the heat gun and put that in the old PK
[SPEAKER_25]: and we do the old school double.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's already been clean.
[SPEAKER_25]: We should think double-foil concentrates
for clean and God knows what was in them.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, PK and then the toast.
[SPEAKER_25]: On the toast.
[SPEAKER_25]: We call it the toast back then with the
heat guns.
[SPEAKER_25]: We send people off the porch, you know,
once a day, somebody go off that porch.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we thought it was, we realized that we
got people fucked up.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like we're really getting them high.
[SPEAKER_25]: But it was really an amazing primitive
source back then.
[SPEAKER_25]: That was vaporizing with those old heat
guns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark McCoy from Vriptec was a big
proponent of the heat gun, particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: the Stein Al who owned the world patent on
the ceramic core.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was very much into educating people and
not using cores that were insulated with
[SPEAKER_05]: asbestos, which is not good for
vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, the heat guns like vape is the
other was still this day.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I've been involved to see
something similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why Mark called it a Vrip.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I like to call it a Vrip here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give you one.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you give you one, you just be
like in Santa Cruz, invented the first
[SPEAKER_15]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was with a heat gun.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he used it wrong because it had a
ceramic without anything that was like
[SPEAKER_15]: asbestos or any of that crap.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a big water pipe, which he put on top
of.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had first asked him to make some sort of
a really small microwave oven,
[SPEAKER_15]: like thumb size, to make a pipe.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is what he came up with.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was like in 84.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he freely gave the information out to
the places that were beginning in the Bay
[SPEAKER_15]: Area for medical cannabis type people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And from there, I saw them everywhere in
the world within a few years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you use hash?
[SPEAKER_27]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_27]: Was it for hash?
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it was for marijuana, for flower tops.
[SPEAKER_27]: For flowers.
OK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_25]: Hash was a thing back then.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_25]: He showed up.
[SPEAKER_25]: We did a kind of a United cannabis troop.
[SPEAKER_15]: His name was Chris Hard.
[SPEAKER_25]: From Santa Cruz, California.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we smoked about two pounds of bud in
two days while Eddie and Jack rolled
[SPEAKER_25]: joints up.
[SPEAKER_25]: We kind of mocked this guy over in the
corner using that vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_25]: And then about three years later,
that's all I was using.
[SPEAKER_25]: What is this thing?
[SPEAKER_25]: We're just like, Eddie's rolling up these
bombers, you know, one after another.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we did that and I watched him.
[SPEAKER_25]: But Chris Carr, yeah, I do remember him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big ups all the giants.
[SPEAKER_15]: I gave him the idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he came up with the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is he now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, where is he now?
[SPEAKER_15]: Last time was more than a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also had told him about Jamaican
steamers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was his solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mark, he's since come up with
nose hits, but it's not as popular as
[SPEAKER_05]: vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like that.
[SPEAKER_26]: Sounds like it wouldn't feel good at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, if you like sneezing, Selena,
it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just want to have the biggest beta
karyophylline sneeze fast ever,
[SPEAKER_26]: then sneeze parties.
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if you knew that,
but I remember just hearing along the line
[SPEAKER_26]: in antiquity, there was like sneezing
parties because it's euphoric.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's so releasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just didn't have any good shit.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's true, too.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, kind of kind of a bit of kind of
taken back to the Acapulco situation,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the way that Panama ran Acapulco
Gold and the certain ways that it was
[SPEAKER_16]: dried and cured, you know, these like
primitive type of, you know, indigenous
[SPEAKER_16]: practices of how to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_16]: It made me think of and I wanted to bring
up if and I don't know if I brought this
[SPEAKER_16]: up before in our church, but the stories
of the Malawi cobs and if anybody knew
[SPEAKER_16]: anything about that, because from what I
have heard about Malawi cobs, they take
[SPEAKER_16]: like a fresh like cola spear and then they
would wrap it in like banana leaf or
[SPEAKER_16]: something and then tie it and then bury it
underground on top of like hot coals or
[SPEAKER_16]: something.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, and apparently it was
just this like they'd take after a certain
[SPEAKER_16]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it was just this crazy,
awesome type of herb.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it seems like it'd be moldy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, I just want to know if any of
you had ever heard of that or know
[SPEAKER_16]: anything about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely heard of the Malawi herb,
never heard of it getting turned into a
cobb.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've heard of it's called cobbing and they
do it in corn cobs, dry corn cobs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't understand how just any sort
of a curing process or squashing curing
[SPEAKER_15]: process can improve the cannabinoid
terpene taste or profile or effect.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there is a definite crowd of people
who believe in it and say it's better.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe the heat, you know,
is melting the heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about this with a guy
yesterday, a friend who is an oil smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was talking about from back in the
day, he said, yeah, there was always two
[SPEAKER_05]: ways of doing oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could put it on a paper which was
fairly inefficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it was one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you actually melted it into the
material that you were smoking and
[SPEAKER_05]: massaged it in and you rolled that,
the intensity was like times 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also experienced that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend from the Kootenays years ago,
Paul D.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feliz from the Holy Smokes Culture Shop
was like, you know, just try putting it
[SPEAKER_05]: into, I melted the oil into the bud and
rolled the joint and it burned completely
[SPEAKER_05]: differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It burned longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was way more efficient rather than just
burning off the edge of the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could see maybe if the resin is
melting in and soaking all the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: matter that when you hit it, that resin is
igniting in a different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's maybe just a more efficient way
for getting to the resin rather than have
[SPEAKER_05]: them be little heads that you have to
burst with that heat.
[SPEAKER_26]: Kind of like a slow oil burn or like a
slow.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be nice to see it both for
microbiological testing and for
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoid and terpene before,
during, and after the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: And try to find out do people really
prefer it processed that way rather than
[SPEAKER_15]: the same bud just processed to normal two
weeks hanging in the dark manicure it and
[SPEAKER_15]: box and cure it for a couple months.
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, that's what I was curious about.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like how do you cure it in the sun?
[SPEAKER_26]: For how long?
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the process?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think in Colombia, the process is
was we don't have any room, so we're just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to put it on this big field right
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was probably the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: They probably dry it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_15]: After a few days, it's dry enough that
they can just stack it in warehouses.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, and that's that's kind of
what's to see the evolution of everything
[SPEAKER_16]: and where hash has gotten to now.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so fascinating because, you know,
all these ways of trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_16]: to preserve turps and then and then
whenever extracts and oil started coming
[SPEAKER_16]: about, you know, people trying to figure
out how to kind of how to most efficiently
[SPEAKER_16]: smoke or utilize or vape and spreading it
on papers or, you know, knife hits and
[SPEAKER_16]: and, you know, kind of all of a sudden,
you have vaporizing or burning it and
[SPEAKER_16]: soaking it into the bud.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then, you know, all of a sudden,
like the glass industry, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of evolved and created the bongs to
have all of a sudden this like different
[SPEAKER_16]: types of buckets or a nail.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and from that kind of
advancement and within the glass culture,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is so, you know, tied to the
cannabis community, you know, the advent
[SPEAKER_16]: of that almost like birth, this whole kind
of, you know, exponential revolution
[SPEAKER_16]: further of extracts into what they have
become now and the whole reality of sauce
[SPEAKER_16]: and terpenes and low temp dabbing and and,
you know, and and yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's just amazing to see just that one
invention or or or just innovation within
[SPEAKER_16]: glass and how much that enabled cannabis
then to to further evolve in the art of
[SPEAKER_16]: hash making.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you look at vaporizing with a glass
pipe and like an electric rig,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's what it's really, really similar to
is the way that opium is vaporized on an
[SPEAKER_15]: opium pipe.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have a little opium pipe with a
clay head with a little hole in the top,
[SPEAKER_15]: put a little doughnut tape ball of opium
around it when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what it does is it drips into the pipe
and you're taking all the good part of it
[SPEAKER_15]: away.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the dross, the the trash part is
sucked into the pipe.
So.
[SPEAKER_15]: It reminds me of that video.
[SPEAKER_15]: Opium was vaporized, you know,
hundreds of years before we we got onto it
[SPEAKER_15]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Luckily, cannabis is a lot less toxic than
opium and less addictive to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I sure wouldn't suggest vaporizing
opium any time soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw some friends go down the rabbit hole
pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all started with with such good vibes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, man, it's just this really nice
Iranian opium, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six months later, I can't get any.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, just by heroin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's on our street.
[SPEAKER_15]: All the same, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: If if you like them, you better not take
them.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't like them, why the hell are
you taking them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that is a motto to live by,
truly live by, because it is a hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: have a fentanyl overdose when you're not
addicted to opioids.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just put that on there for real or
carb of fentanyl, which is like a hundred
[SPEAKER_16]: thousand times or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than that shit's an elephant
tranquilizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see the suits those guys wear when
they're handling that shit, the
[SPEAKER_05]: veterinarian?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks like some NASA level seven
shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it can kill you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the tiniest little piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carfentanil.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the pinhead sized head is toxic or
lethal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they pulled a kilo out of it out of
a house in Canada not too long ago that
[SPEAKER_05]: came over the border.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those people got like, you know,
that shit kills people.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's almost evil shit there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also because it's not it's the A,
it's evil, but B, they're super
[SPEAKER_05]: inefficient at mixing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they create hotspots in their drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They press these pills that have hotspots
with it where there's way too much of that
[SPEAKER_05]: particular drug and way too much is like a
fraction of a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, and that's also it's horrifying
because there's so much, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: of that being diluted and put into pressed
like off-market benzodiazepines that are
[SPEAKER_16]: being sold as Xanax.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are these little like Xanax bars
that don't that aren't Xanax bars and they
[SPEAKER_16]: have they have fentanyl in them.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there's this whole like epidemic
kind of thing happening where people kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of in the festival or party scene when
they take stimulants at night,
[SPEAKER_16]: they'll do what's like called landing here
where they'll where they'll then take like
[SPEAKER_16]: a pharmaceutical like, you know,
kind of anxiolytic kind of benzodiazepine
[SPEAKER_16]: like Xanax or Valium to kind of go to
sleep and kind of come down.
[SPEAKER_16]: And whenever there's this huge correlation
to people having their heart stop and die
[SPEAKER_16]: from basically at trying to take what they
think is Xanax to come down off the
[SPEAKER_16]: stimulant, but take what it has fentanyl
in it and then it stops your heart when
[SPEAKER_16]: they die.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to promote cannabis as the
ultimate landing gear for this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on, you want to go to bed?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's when you take a fall over knockout
dose like your buddy Eagle Bill.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like we're what it's in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know which dispensary is
sponsoring it.
[SPEAKER_26]: I have my suspicions, but they're offering
cannabis for people that are wanting to
[SPEAKER_26]: come off opiates and people to just like
do some harm reduction in the community.
[SPEAKER_26]: So if people are going to be doing that,
they can also have access to some cannabis
[SPEAKER_26]: if that's what they're really looking for.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I wonder if and this is just like my
inner ponderings if cannabis will be one
[SPEAKER_26]: of those saving graces to help overcome
the fentanyl crisis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, like I wonder if she'll be this
beautiful you know, this is an option and
[SPEAKER_26]: it's so much safer and it's so much more
readily available and you can grow it and
[SPEAKER_26]: there's so many facets of healing
associated with it and being this
[SPEAKER_26]: transitionary plant that can help us heal.
[SPEAKER_26]: I see this as this juxtaposition right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend literally who was the
person I was kind of talking about when I
[SPEAKER_05]: was mentioning the opium because he was
like, yeah, it's this good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he became he went so far down
the rabbit hole addicted to crack addicted
[SPEAKER_05]: to heroin alcoholic living on the street
just just ultimately dropped down to the
[SPEAKER_05]: bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he hit me up for the first time in
over 15 years recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to work together in the in the
industry years years ago, almost 20 years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he hit me up and he said, listen,
man, I watch your shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to the content that you're
putting out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got myself off drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used cannabis to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I want to do now is I want to I
want to help others do that very same that
[SPEAKER_05]: very same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I suggest that I suggested to him,
I said, start a group.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the voice to trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one can be the voice better than you
because you've been he's now living with
[SPEAKER_05]: his wife and his two kids and he's got his
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it is incredible because
he's managed to get out from all the most
[SPEAKER_05]: powerful addictions that you could
possibly have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now here he is offering the tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him, listen, get an organization,
start, start doing the work and trust me,
[SPEAKER_05]: the help will come.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll help.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll help in any way, shape that I and
form that I can, because that's that's
[SPEAKER_05]: also very sort of angelic type work that
that's a good work.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's to the root of the plant's purpose
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we have it as an obligation
almost to to identify and like really
[SPEAKER_16]: shine light towards.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_26]: I had so many things.
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, one of the things I wanted to share
is I see a lot of healers in communities
[SPEAKER_26]: and oftentimes they've overcome.
[SPEAKER_26]: A really huge experience, just like your
friends, and they've lived through it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And because they've lived through it,
they have the ability to communicate with
[SPEAKER_26]: other people and they're able to empathize
with them and help them overcome because
[SPEAKER_26]: of their own personal experience.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_26]: Your friend is probably the best person to
be doing this work because they truly
[SPEAKER_26]: understand it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I also just wanted to say side note,
I think cannabis can help with addiction
[SPEAKER_26]: from the perspective of trauma and
overcoming trauma.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think it helps make it just so much I
mean, you're still moving through
[SPEAKER_26]: emotions, you're still moving through a
process.
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think it just makes it that much
more available, that much more supported.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think when we're working with
cannabis in a positive way with right
[SPEAKER_26]: relationship, because we can also have an
unhealthy relationship with her,
[SPEAKER_26]: too.
[SPEAKER_26]: So just being mindful of that,
but also bringing in that process and
[SPEAKER_26]: allowing her to guide.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the other other thing,
just going back to the technology piece
[SPEAKER_26]: and how just you know, vaporizers have
evolved, the glass has evolved,
[SPEAKER_26]: along with the plant, along with our
discovery of her and what she has to offer
[SPEAKER_26]: us in all these different ways,
like the terpenes and looking at the
[SPEAKER_26]: isolated cannabinoids and looking at all
these different types of effects,
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, broad leaf, narrow leaf,
all these different things that she can
[SPEAKER_26]: offer us.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just wonder how much of that process
is her guiding us towards her reclamation
[SPEAKER_26]: as well.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, I really do believe that she has
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: I know.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, I'm just she's so brilliant.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just I'm kind of in reverie over
that.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: So when I go back to the opioid crisis
right now and looking at the healing that
[SPEAKER_26]: can happen, I think humanity is quite
traumatized.
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is, you know, multigenerational
trauma that's not been resolved.
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't have the right coping mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of our heritage has been taken from
us and in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rites of passage.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_26]: Rites of passage is so important.
[SPEAKER_26]: I just got full body chills, you know,
transitioning from being a young person to
[SPEAKER_26]: an adult, to a recognized elder in a
community, even all of these all of these
[SPEAKER_26]: important stages are not being recognized.
[SPEAKER_26]: So as people are going through it,
they don't realize what's happening.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, it's an evolution of self.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like a shedding of a skin.
[SPEAKER_26]: You're cocooning and now you're emerging
as this beautiful butterfly.
[SPEAKER_26]: But you don't understand what that
struggle is.
[SPEAKER_26]: And when you put it in the context of of
the rites of passage, you have a community
[SPEAKER_26]: to support and to to mirror and to say you
can do this.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've gone through this, you know,
going back to the healers or the people
[SPEAKER_26]: that have experienced that and being able
to help guide another's process.
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe that's where true healing is.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I truly believe that's what's
happening with this plant.
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why she's here.
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why this is happening at this
time.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're really seeing this extreme dichotomy
play out.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just want to remind everyone to hold
hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold hope and have faith.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll all work out if we make it.
[SPEAKER_26]: Make sure that it does on church of all
places.
Right.
[SPEAKER_26]: And side note, Marcus, I used to call it
going to church.
[SPEAKER_26]: I had two ways of saying I was going to go
smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_26]: It was I'm going to church or I'm going to
Uncle Rodriguez's oyster emporium or Uncle
[SPEAKER_26]: ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always easy for me to say that I have
faith without really thinking about it
[SPEAKER_05]: religiously, because my wife's middle name
is Faith.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's been in my life almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with her, I have faith.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't wait to meet her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the she's the what do we call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: The oh, what did they call the better
half?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the better half, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was going to say the bubble woman,
the character from from Sesame Street that
[SPEAKER_05]: you never saw, like only Big Bird saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like the she's like the snuffle up
against in the sense because she's very
[SPEAKER_05]: like low key.
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't show up too much at the events
and at the you know, she's mom and she's
[SPEAKER_05]: hardcore mom.
[SPEAKER_26]: And she's she's got a whole other world
going on.
[SPEAKER_26]: And just the fact that you guys are just
this beautiful.
[SPEAKER_26]: I see you as like these pillars,
really, just from the stories that you've
[SPEAKER_26]: told me and just the things that I've
heard.
[SPEAKER_26]: She seems like quite a remarkable woman.
[SPEAKER_26]: And to birth three children and mom them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much respect drug drug free and like at
home.
[SPEAKER_26]: Does she smoke weed to help her get
through the craziness?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, she's not a big cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in our during the first pregnancy,
she used it just the tiniest bit for
[SPEAKER_05]: nausea that was extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the tiniest little little vapor hit
would just take it away 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was it was a few times that she felt
comfortable using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was during a time that it was
still kind of like, oh, hey, wait a
[SPEAKER_05]: minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, now they're like, well,
actually, it's a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's probably good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a neuroprotectant is good.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was a woman who did a study.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a friend of Rob Clark's.
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably know her, too, Sam,
the woman that did the study in Jamaica on
[SPEAKER_05]: the women, the Rastafarian women that were
actually smoking not just small amounts,
[SPEAKER_05]: but copious amounts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, her study is definitely an
interesting one to check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely no negatives found,
but some unique and surprisingly positive
[SPEAKER_26]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that Sam?
[SPEAKER_15]: Overall, the children were better than the
average.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they had they showed a higher skill
levels at certain things, for sure,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, it's about getting back to the
source, you know, Mother Earth,
[SPEAKER_25]: our deeper spirituality.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what cannabis is bringing us to.
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been meditating for 45 years and I
was raised to, you know, a traditional
[SPEAKER_25]: Catholic myself.
[SPEAKER_25]: We all rejected so much of that.
[SPEAKER_25]: But we need to get back into our different
spiritual ways.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to bring that into the cup
this year.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we have to incorporate that into our
lives in whatever way we do.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not just the opiates.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the it's the crank and the speed,
because the opiates people can actually
[SPEAKER_25]: come back from for the most part.
[SPEAKER_25]: They don't they don't die in overoses.
[SPEAKER_25]: The crank and the speed, the mental and
psychological damage, they're not even
[SPEAKER_25]: able to really regain most of that.
[SPEAKER_25]: And we've got this whole lost tribe of
zombies coming in.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really an amazing thing that I see so
much.
[SPEAKER_25]: My brother in law is Captain Watsonville
PD.
[SPEAKER_25]: He was he's retired and he just talked
about how he would get them all in
[SPEAKER_25]: cannabis because you need to get him
eating food and getting grounded and
[SPEAKER_25]: stable.
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's a whole new way of
rehabilitation we've got to bring into our
[SPEAKER_25]: our country and stuff.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really something else.
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got to jump.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Selena.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_25]: All you guys.
[SPEAKER_25]: Marcus, you're amazing.
[SPEAKER_25]: Alec, everybody else.
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, three years.
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope to be part of this for a long time
coming and look to see all the work is
[SPEAKER_25]: wonderful to hear about the panic stories.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just I'm so proud you're doing that
so long ago.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I look forward to being your person.
[SPEAKER_25]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks a lot, Tim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your kind words are appreciated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to Tim.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Emerald Cup team.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hate the fact that I can't be
there.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, Marcus, we were trying to
actually see if you want to be a
[SPEAKER_16]: concentrate judge this year, because,
you know, they just shifted to where you
[SPEAKER_16]: have to be there for the first meeting.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the last meeting.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then the in-betweens, you know,
might be done kind of conference or kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of Google Hangout.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you can't make it, you can't make
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another time, my friends, another time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Samurai Sam in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't heard from you, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, thanks for having me, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_23]: I've fought through some connection issues
there as I was listening to your history
[SPEAKER_23]: with your vapor lounge.
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thought it might be a good time to
try to come into this packed church.
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been doing pretty good down here in
Seattle now.
[SPEAKER_23]: We've gone from up tech, but it's really
stoked to see what ended up coming of my
[SPEAKER_23]: appearance on your show and get you linked
up with Gary.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm really looking forward to trying the
pen, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude, we definitely got to get you a
pen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you one because you were a huge
part on making this pen happen.
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, like you mentioned
yesterday, man, I'd be down to come visit
[SPEAKER_23]: if that's still in the cards.
[SPEAKER_23]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, come visit.
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't have to ship me one,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when Sam first came up here and we
were talking about all these pens,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was definitely like, yeah, I just don't
think that after he educated me,
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, I lost faith in a lot of the
pens that were on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sort of sketched me out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess it's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you're into, learn as much of it
as you can go into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can't go into it deep enough,
find people who are geeking out or nerding
[SPEAKER_05]: out to such an extent, much like the
people who are on this panel, that they'll
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll take your hand and sort of walk
you along and be like, listen,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is this is how it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I love the idea of having people
that I can contact who know about these
[SPEAKER_05]: things better than I do, because how can
you learn all of these things to that
[SPEAKER_05]: level?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost feel like we could start a
cannabis Uber where you could order up any
[SPEAKER_05]: type of like information that you want,
whether it was the SC labs type
[SPEAKER_05]: information, the spiritual, the physical,
the vaporizer information, lighting
[SPEAKER_05]: information, just guys like Brad,
people like that are on full level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, OK, boom, you're getting questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're you're paying a small fee to answer
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like high level consulting done
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a true level of, you know,
it's like everyone's a consultant now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's turned the cannabis industry into
kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do these companies actually go for
true consulting that's actually going to
[SPEAKER_05]: help them out along their mission
statement of of trying to produce
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Consultants are like master growers now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a consultant and a master grower,
actually.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I actually I got to scoot out here in
a sec, but I wanted to if you guys are
[SPEAKER_16]: down real quick, I wanted to show you our
lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about showing us those posters for a
quick second?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_16]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_16]: These are like some of the first years we
tested.
[SPEAKER_16]: Emerald Cup was kind of like the launch of
our company.
[SPEAKER_16]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, so I'm going to show you some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is our micro lab, little flow
hood.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, actually, here we go.
[SPEAKER_16]: Micro lab, little flow hood, some
pipettes, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: And here we have a QPCR.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we have our one of our
microbiologists.
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, it's a scientist.
[SPEAKER_16]: But so that's where our micro room is.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to show you our prep lab and our
instrument room.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll come back in here in a second.
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is the instrument room,
some mass bed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Next, our analysts that are in there
analyzing some of the data.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then inside here, this is our prep
lab.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this thing right here, we just
recently invested in.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a Hamilton robotics.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a automated sample prep machine that
helps to automate certain aspects of
[SPEAKER_16]: sample preparation to bring about more
consistency.
[SPEAKER_16]: And higher throughput, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in our instrument room,
these are HPLCs are the taller stacks that
[SPEAKER_16]: are in tandem with triple quadrupole mass
spectrometers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Jesus, the heavy hitters right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's how we do kind of pesticide
testing for the different analyze we look
[SPEAKER_16]: for down to the single digit per billion.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're assuming they're going to be
extending that to like 60 something
[SPEAKER_16]: pesticides with California regulations.
[SPEAKER_16]: So chemical flow hood.
[SPEAKER_16]: These are a couple of high performance
liquid chromatographs, HPLCs.
[SPEAKER_16]: These are kind of standalone that do all
the cannabinoid testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're kind of our workhorse cannabinoid
testing instruments.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, then the HPLCs next to each one
of these mass specs are kind of dedicated
[SPEAKER_16]: pretty much to be in tandem with the mass
specs.
[SPEAKER_16]: For pesticide testing and our amazing
analysts working on a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, those thermo thermoscientific are the
ones in the back.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then on the side over here next to the
those are Shimatsu HPLC and in tandem with
[SPEAKER_16]: AB PsyX 3500 triple quads.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then last space.
[SPEAKER_16]: These right here are our gas
chromatographs.
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are GCs.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of them is they're both set up to be
able to basically the autosampler can
[SPEAKER_16]: switch back and forth between doing
headspace testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: So these files right here are kind of
headspace.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they'll have like half a gram of
extract that will be in them.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they get basically closed.
[SPEAKER_16]: The gas chromatograph will basically take
it in sequence and drop it into this gas
[SPEAKER_16]: chromatograph and heat it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And basically any volatile organic
compound of residual solvent will boil off
[SPEAKER_16]: and sit in headspace.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it'll through after the process.
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, that's what we the setup that
we do for residual solvent analysis
[SPEAKER_16]: residual solvent testing, which is using
headspace as opposed to terpenes,
[SPEAKER_16]: which are the other other major tests that
we use gas chromatography for.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're liquid dilution that then they
go through GC with flame ionization
[SPEAKER_16]: detection to to go through the analysis
for terpene.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, so gas chromatography is the
chromatography tool we use for the
[SPEAKER_16]: volatile compounds like residual solvents,
processing chemicals and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: volatile terpenes as opposed to a liquid
chromatography, which is more dedicated
[SPEAKER_16]: for anything cannabinoid testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the sample prep any different for those
two methods?
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, so sample prep is for GC testing for
residual solvents is essentially just
[SPEAKER_16]: taking a weighed out half gram,
putting it in one of those headspace
[SPEAKER_16]: files, and then putting in sequence kind
of as far as doing the terpene.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's it's pretty much the same prep as the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_16]: So like, you know, doing a extraction kind
of, you know, kind of a prep for your
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabinoids, you know, essentially that
we can just have as for terpenes to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it looks great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have ICP for doing metals as
well.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been we've been looking around
trying to basically see which ICP setup is
[SPEAKER_16]: the most robust.
[SPEAKER_16]: Reliable.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, one of the big things we've
been, you know, constantly working with
[SPEAKER_16]: the instrument companies on is putting
their machines, you know, really to the
[SPEAKER_16]: test of cannabis, because cannabis,
you know, obviously such a complex matrix
[SPEAKER_16]: and it's very sticky and you're taking so
much of the oil and, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: and so so much in sample prep.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're just trying to find the most,
you know, with pesticide testing,
[SPEAKER_16]: we're trying to find, you know,
what what setup what machine could handle
[SPEAKER_16]: such robust use with cannabis being passed
through it and, you know, optimizing
[SPEAKER_16]: sample prep, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for ICP, it's a kind of a whole new
world of testing that we haven't yet
[SPEAKER_16]: gotten into.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're kind of still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Shimazu has got a new instrument that's
specifically for cannabis for ICP for
[SPEAKER_02]: trace heavy metals.
Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk to your Shimazu rep, because I
went to a seminar that they had in
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia, Maryland, maybe about four or
five months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they debuted a couple of the
instruments that they now I think these
[SPEAKER_02]: are all going to be at all the shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, they're out, you know,
trying to sell these instruments,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just talk to your Shimazu rep because
they have that they basically want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the one stop shopping for all,
you know, cannabis related
[SPEAKER_02]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their new LC system is actually called
the Cannabis Analyzer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you have to kind of pry it out and
say, well, what the fuck is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Analyzer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I need I need to see the acronym
to know what the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Analyzer could be some guy with a
wizard with some like magic wand telling
[SPEAKER_02]: you like what your cannabinoids in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have now internal standards and
and protocols that are like I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: they're proprietary from what they're
telling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess the run methods are all good
for like the nine major or seven major
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is worth mentioning
because we're talking about testing is the
[SPEAKER_02]: NCIA just formed a new working group
testing the NCIA being the National
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is, again, to get everyone
all of this testing that's going on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry harmonious and most of all,
to make sure that the labs are you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: audited in a third party kind of way to
make sure that the results you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: generating, which really hundreds of
thousands of dollars is at stake because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about all the testing
results that you're generating for all
[SPEAKER_02]: your clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just it's it's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you look at all that sophisticated
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Selena was talking again about
education is really the key because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't just be some, you know, not knowing
what you're doing to walk out on the
[SPEAKER_02]: street and walk up to those instruments
and know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need a fundamental education of
what it is you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sample handling, I think,
is like a huge thing in the testing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the error that's built into
testing, I think, has to be taken into
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration that samples are being
handled by multiple people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not necessarily to have,
you know, hygiene just being one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential ways for contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had a sample that came back
contaminated for a fungicide that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: even used in agricultural applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used in for topical applications and
in veterinary applications for for yeast
[SPEAKER_02]: infections and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, some person, you know,
handling the plan or handling the hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, touched or maybe applied that
medicine to the dog that day or something
[SPEAKER_02]: or brushed up against the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're testing at the part per
billion level, I've said it before on Hash
[SPEAKER_02]: Church, it's like taking a lint brush to a
New York City sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take one of those triple quads and unroll
a one hundred dollar bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll sniff cocaine off it, even though
there is no cocaine in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the level of sensitivity that these
instruments have are incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to look at to make sure
that you're saying, well, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have zero or zero PPM as our power or PPB.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to think again about the
practicality of that and about going down
[SPEAKER_02]: to Whole Foods and testing a whole bunch
of produce in there and seeing is it hold
[SPEAKER_02]: up to the same level of scrutiny,
especially when you're looking down at the
[SPEAKER_02]: part per billion range where, again,
there's just stuff in the air and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff we come in contact with and you
could really skew a lot of results that
[SPEAKER_02]: way, you know?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, a couple of things on that
point, because, yeah, one hundred percent
[SPEAKER_16]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so one is around testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, yeah, without super robust
regulations, requirements, accreditation,
[SPEAKER_16]: proficiency testing on laboratories that
are doing the testing for the regulated
[SPEAKER_16]: market.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you don't have that, then that's one of
the biggest vulnerabilities in the entire
[SPEAKER_16]: system to where, you know, in a lot of
other states, you know, all testing would
[SPEAKER_16]: go towards the lab that would never fail
anybody, you know, that would just pass
[SPEAKER_16]: clean results and all kinds of herbs just
getting in the marketplace dirty.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, Colorado and Washington
both learned a lot of mistake,
[SPEAKER_16]: learned a lot from that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oregon changed it.
[SPEAKER_16]: California followed suit.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you have to have basically a high
level of ISO accreditation on every
[SPEAKER_16]: individual assay that you have offered to
the public.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I so 17 zero to five on each test that
you are offering to the public.
[SPEAKER_16]: Which basically dictates the substantial
quality system and documentation
[SPEAKER_16]: traceability.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, to every aspect of the
system and the quality and the
[SPEAKER_16]: consistency, you know, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then further, you know, there's some
some level of like almost like quarterly
[SPEAKER_16]: proficiency testing that's going to be
done through one of these P.T.
companies.
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot on the there's a couple of the
names.
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot the people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's ISO accreditation around
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a one seven oath for three or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, all testing labs for all other
industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything that's adjacent to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how these these labs are
maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, when you look at a label on a
food product or something and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the level of, I don't know,
carbohydrates or iron or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, those labs have all been tested and
the operators are all certified and they
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure again, they come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's quarterly to make sure that
their HPLCs are working properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as history that there's a considerable
downtime to taking your instruments
[SPEAKER_02]: offline to where now we have to calibrate
or we have to clean our injection ports or
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to make sure that our instruments
are maintaining the core level
[SPEAKER_02]: performance.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's that's part of your internal
quality program quality system that you
[SPEAKER_16]: either follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are probably one of the
better labs around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would only imagine just because,
again, I think a lot of people rely on the
[SPEAKER_02]: reliability of your results.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we don't take that lightly,
you know, because for one, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: and and and, you know, it's we've come
incredibly far over the last seven and a
[SPEAKER_16]: half years and we take a lot of pride in a
repeated ability and kind of accuracy and
[SPEAKER_16]: precision.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not ever it's not to ever take a
position that, you know, we don't make
[SPEAKER_16]: mistakes because just like you pointed out
through sample handling, through samples,
[SPEAKER_16]: getting maybe, you know, in the prep
process swap, you know, there's all these
[SPEAKER_16]: steps and potential places where a lot of
error can come about.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're in such a high stakes kind of
thing when hundreds of thousands,
[SPEAKER_16]: millions of dollars of product is at
stake.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, we're incredibly excited
and encouraging and welcoming for kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: what's the levels of requirements on the
labs that's coming because because the
[SPEAKER_16]: proficiency testing that, you know,
it's like if you don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: they're going to send out like,
you know, blind sample, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: with a spiked matrix of certain pesticides
on a cannabis sample.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's going to be on the lab to,
you know, basically without knowing
[SPEAKER_16]: anything, just test it for pesticides and
be able to test what pesticides at what
[SPEAKER_16]: concentrations are there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you can't pass, then you don't
you're not able to offer your service to
[SPEAKER_16]: the public.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, so, you know, we think that's
going to, you know, bring a high level of
[SPEAKER_16]: accountability to the labs.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of not there right now and
which creates a lot of distrust in the
[SPEAKER_16]: community around labs because which labs
are right, which labs are wrong,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, it's all labs bullshit is
testing just bullshit in general.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I think it's going to really raise
the standards for, you know, who is going
[SPEAKER_16]: to be offering these, you know,
very needed services and to be more able
[SPEAKER_16]: to be relying reliant on them.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then the other aspect to your what
you're bringing up, which is huge is,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, we've been rallying kind of
really, really you know, thoroughly kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of around kind of, you know, identifying
that California went way too far in one
[SPEAKER_16]: aspect of regulation and it was around
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like we were kind of, for what it's worth,
we're pretty pleased with, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: certain other aspects.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think certain things like moisture
content and water activities kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: irrelevant or kind of, you know,
it's their way of indirectly like
[SPEAKER_16]: regulating yeast and mold and aerobic
bacteria without directly regulating it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, but and it's more, I guess,
appropriate for edibles or infused
[SPEAKER_16]: products, whatever.
[SPEAKER_16]: But around pests and, you know,
with microbes, they're more focusing on
[SPEAKER_16]: pathogen, you know, aspergillus,
mycotoxin producing species, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_16]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: But with pesticides, they didn't account
for, you know, California is, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: one of the largest, obviously,
agricultural states in the United States.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, especially, you know,
focus around these certain big areas,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, Central Valley and kind of
Salinas and how much produce comes from
[SPEAKER_16]: there and the reality of how much spraying
and pesticide use is deployed there,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, is like the, you know,
there was, they had to create a national
[SPEAKER_16]: organic program, an exemption for the fact
that drift is real, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_16]: unavoidable residual environmental
contamination.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's like if, you know,
5% of what's allowed on conventional
[SPEAKER_16]: crops, as long as you're below that,
it can still be sent into the market as
[SPEAKER_16]: organic, which means that unfortunately
about 30% of organic produce that you buy
[SPEAKER_16]: still has up to 50 to a hundred parts per
billion of, you know, a handful of
[SPEAKER_16]: different types of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the reality of drift is incredibly
important to recognize that if you go away
[SPEAKER_16]: over regulative, like California proposed
10 to 20 part per billion, 0.01 to 0.02
[SPEAKER_16]: PPM, you know, which is 10 to 20 PBB,
you know, there's no accounting for drift
[SPEAKER_16]: there.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, that's one of the,
you know, kind of a, I mean, I'm really
[SPEAKER_16]: for kind of strict pesticide, limits or,
you know, but not that strict.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I think you have to account for
drift and you have to, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: the rate and I, and there's so much
industry pushback kind of, I think got the
[SPEAKER_16]: word across.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it looks like in the next round of
proposed regulations, the pesticide limits
[SPEAKER_02]: should shift, you know, have you guys ever
tested produce?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tested store bought produce?
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I mean, there's, there's, they're
incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, so what, what levels do you
see of amid a cloak grid and some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: bad actors that are not, you know,
are again, maybe it's a knee jerk reaction
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, but to maybe make sure that
there's zero levels of these in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's a background level of these in
our environment, we're kind of screwing
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially if it goes way too
over-regulating.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, but, you know, with, you know,
we don't have enough data to kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: really speak confidently on the vegetable
thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause you know, we've done a lot of
testing for like, you know, people would
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, right around the time where the
LA thing happened, where, um, all those,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, pesticides were found in the NBC
story.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, there was certain groups
that would send, you know, like 10,
[SPEAKER_16]: 20 different types of vegetable and to
test for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, some of them over others,
like had, you know, few parts per million
[SPEAKER_16]: of, you know, I'm going to cooperate or
Michael butanol, um, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_16]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, but I mean, I, I would, I wouldn't
speculate that if all those things were
[SPEAKER_16]: dried out to the dry weight of what
cannabis would be, you know, when we
[SPEAKER_16]: consume it, I bet the pesticide amounts
would, you know, skyrocket and how much,
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, you know, we actually saw.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think we're really analyzing it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we were to dry out all of these
kind of, you know, vegetables and fruit
[SPEAKER_16]: and then test them, you know, it'd
probably be shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying in the chat, test tobacco,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in tobacco?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well, it's one of the few pesticides
that's actually approved on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, that is analogous to kind of what you
could be seen to be able to be maybe
[SPEAKER_16]: sprayed on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but, but it, it won't ever be allowed
because especially in California,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's, you know, since it's a neo
nicotinoid and why would you put a new
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick on a plant that generates nicotine?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of counterintuitive to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, in case of California
throwing sand down at the beach.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, but, you know, again, it's,
you know, I think it's, we're,
[SPEAKER_16]: we're, we're, we kind of live in a,
you know, a bit of a dirty environment
[SPEAKER_16]: now, especially in bigger agricultural
states.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, um, it's really
important that the regulators don't
[SPEAKER_16]: overregulate on these certain things.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause it could be, you know, incredibly
kind of detrimental to most people
[SPEAKER_16]: producing in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_16]: There might be geographical dead zones at
a certain point, you know, it's too
[SPEAKER_16]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, so, you know, we're, we're,
we're trying to, you know, focus our voice
[SPEAKER_16]: and effectively, you know, get this point
across to help, uh, push it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, you know, we think, you know,
from all the industry support and push,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: But then, but, but beyond that,
you know, I think, uh, the, some of your
[SPEAKER_16]: other concerns and questions about,
uh, internal lab quality control,
[SPEAKER_16]: quality assurance, uh, systems to,
you know, to be able to be repeatable and
[SPEAKER_16]: consistent precise, I think, um,
is, is, you know, it's, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_16]: an incredible testament of labs,
abilities to get through the full ISO
[SPEAKER_16]: accreditation on every test and
proficiency testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause, you know, that level of testing and
accreditation, most labs don't have,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, they spent, you know,
in the environmental testing or food
[SPEAKER_16]: testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, any lab that's able to
get through all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's like, they have something,
you know, and, and, you know, then from
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know, it's going to be a key
differentiator and unfortunately probably
[SPEAKER_02]: tied to how well funded they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, a lot of these instruments
aren't expensive and really have
[SPEAKER_02]: proficient people to run them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to hire quality people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that costs money.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God money grows on trees.
[SPEAKER_23]: This one thing I wanted to bring up being
up here in Washington state, I'd be a
[SPEAKER_23]: little leery of lumping Washington state
in as one of those industries where the
[SPEAKER_23]: testing agencies have learned,
or at least the regulatory agencies
[SPEAKER_23]: overseeing these labs has learned.
[SPEAKER_23]: Cause we don't have ISO 17.025
accreditation required in Washington.
[SPEAKER_23]: And we don't have mandatory pesticide
testing.
[SPEAKER_23]: As a concentrate producer in this
marketplace, it's really disheartening to
[SPEAKER_23]: see how little oversight is really going
into this and how much pushback there is
[SPEAKER_23]: from growers to prevent pesticide testing
that could improve product safety in our
[SPEAKER_23]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's one of the, you know,
cause I, you know, cause that happened in
[SPEAKER_16]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_16]: Similarly, Colorado and Washington at
first, they regulated like yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_16]: and aerobic bacteria at like a hundred
thousand or something.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, they, and they didn't
regulate anything about pesticide testing
[SPEAKER_16]: or what pesticides.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, so obviously people have sprayed
tons of pesticides and have gotten away
[SPEAKER_16]: with it since.
[SPEAKER_23]: We just have a voluntary list here with no
oversight and they're counting on growers
[SPEAKER_23]: to, to take care of things.
[SPEAKER_23]: And it happens very often that when the
state does finally have time to come
[SPEAKER_23]: through, which is six months to a year,
because the LCB, the Liquor Control Board
[SPEAKER_23]: is actually overseeing it and they're
drastically understaffed.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, these farms are getting shut
down one, two or three year.
[SPEAKER_23]: They're finding microbial and other really
serious things that shouldn't be on the
[SPEAKER_23]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_23]: And it turns out they've got six months of
product that's contaminated with that.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's been sold the whole time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty
crazy still.
[SPEAKER_16]: How Washington and, you know, and I think
Colorado has figured out, started to
[SPEAKER_16]: figure out a little bit more, but,
you know, I mean, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the way Oregon went and the way
California kind of saw Oregon and
[SPEAKER_16]: followed, it's kind of almost like each
States are kind of slowly learning from
[SPEAKER_16]: some of the mistakes of the previous,
you know, kind of.
[SPEAKER_23]: As a Washingtonian, I'm thrilled about how
much regulation you guys have.
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think it's better to be on the safe
side and then try to back off from that
[SPEAKER_23]: than what we have where we have
potentially unsafe products.
[SPEAKER_23]: And we don't know where you guys will be
gathering the data that's required.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then have really robust regulations
and proficiency testing on the labs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause the labs, if they're a gatekeeper of
helping to prevent dirty meds from getting
[SPEAKER_16]: into the market and community,
they have to be almost more regulated
[SPEAKER_16]: than, you know, the producers and
processors.
[SPEAKER_23]: The mandatory round robin testing that
comes along with that 1725 accreditation
[SPEAKER_23]: is something we don't have.
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's one of the reasons our labs are
so inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have these lab shutdowns and bad
numbers.
[SPEAKER_23]: Peak analytics just got pulled here.
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of people whose companies were
trusting peak analytics to go to now are
[SPEAKER_23]: in a gray zone.
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't know what to do with all these
products that are in limbo now.
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's not fun.
[SPEAKER_23]: Hope it gets better.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just curious, Alec, are you guys going
to be opening up shop in Canada?
[SPEAKER_16]: We would love to.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't, we don't have any, you know,
we're kind of really just focused at this
[SPEAKER_16]: point.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we've been just kind of self
funded and growing kind of from our,
[SPEAKER_16]: the business that we, you know,
have created and built in California from
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of a voluntary testing community.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, we're kind of slow
growing, doing our thing here in
[SPEAKER_16]: California and we just opening up in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, we have, yeah, of most
places or Canada is definitely like one of
[SPEAKER_16]: the biggest, I think, desires of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the raise would be pretty easy,
Alec, to do a raise for you guys here in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, if, yeah, that was ever a
possibility, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_16]: yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_26]: Let the seed be planted now.
[SPEAKER_26]: Just put it out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit cracks fast on Hashchurch,
let me tell you, because some certain
[SPEAKER_05]: dialogues, we were having dialogues about
terpenes before they were cannabis derived
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes were available as a product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were having conversations about rosin
presses that didn't exist on Hashchurch,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, before they existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting to see a lot of the
dialogues and how they've expanded the
[SPEAKER_05]: community vastly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even right now, it's crowded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an entrepreneur and you want to
get into the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just spelled out an unmet need in the
cannabis marketplace for good testing
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories in states like Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Oregon's actually doing
pretty, or maybe a little bit better than
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, but certainly an unmet need,
you know, when you're going to someone
[SPEAKER_02]: like Alec and saying, hey, one of you guys
going to come, one of you guys going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come, I mean, business people love that
kind of suction in the marketplace to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: ah, build it and they will come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put together a business plan and
you hire somebody who knows how to run all
[SPEAKER_02]: that sophisticated instruments that we
just saw in the lab, you can basically
[SPEAKER_02]: have a business testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are doing this out east now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I say out east, east of the
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's not just in the western
states, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're it's all over across the country,
across the U S anyway.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: There is a huge demand for it here.
[SPEAKER_23]: We've just got our first 17 0 2 5
certified labs.
[SPEAKER_23]: Medicine Creek analytics is now operating
in Washington and I hope to see more of
[SPEAKER_23]: that quality of testing coming into our
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_23]: Really looking for some.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name again, Sam?
[SPEAKER_23]: Medicine Creek analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You broke up on the first part.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine?
[SPEAKER_23]: Medicine Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine Creek analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are they located?
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a little bit further of a drive than
like analytical 360 that we've been using
[SPEAKER_23]: a super convenient.
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me check to see where they're at.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, and also that's the other
thing, you know, it's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: biggest big ups to all, you know,
labs that are trying to figure it out and
[SPEAKER_16]: have been doing it to, you know,
work towards figuring this plan out
[SPEAKER_16]: because it's incredibly difficult plant
with a very fascinating and difficult
[SPEAKER_16]: matrix to basically fully go through the
process of formal method validation,
[SPEAKER_16]: being able to, you know, get to the point
where you can create consistent
[SPEAKER_16]: reproducible results, both on cannabis,
easier on extracts and hardest on,
[SPEAKER_16]: on the different types of infused
products.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, whenever you're infusing
cannabis, you know, it's one of the,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the lab has to then go through
the process of kind of essentially reverse
[SPEAKER_16]: engineering and extracting the cannabinoid
content off of whatever that matrix is,
[SPEAKER_16]: whether it's a Brownie or a solid kind of
lolly pop or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: to be able to accurately test it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, it's, it's a,
there's a, there's a whole body
[SPEAKER_16]: intelligence of awareness and knowledge
and, and, you know, getting to the point
[SPEAKER_16]: of figuring out how to do that types of
that type of testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, anybody that's going
through it and trying to, and,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, building, you know, with
integrity, their quality system and ISO
[SPEAKER_16]: accreditation and, you know, just making
it happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, there's, yeah, it's a,
it's an incredible task, but it's been the
[SPEAKER_16]: most educational experience of my life for
sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Super.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_23]: And big ups to analytical in that regard,
who's been, you know, on top of the
[SPEAKER_23]: testing game here in Washington for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_23]: And Dr. Mark, the Medicine Creek guys are
located in Fife, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Alec, if you shoot me your email,
I don't know if you've seen the SOPs that
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon put in place around sample
handling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled them down off their site and so
they have a sample handling one for both
[SPEAKER_02]: flour concentrate and formulated product
that talks about the statistical
[SPEAKER_02]: significance of how big the sample has to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like looking at like a 10 pound,
you know, or 20 pound quantity,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what becomes a statistically
significant sample for such a large
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, thinking, you know,
and put some, you know, really smart
[SPEAKER_02]: people in charge of basically setting
their policy and SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I see your, your email here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll shoot you a copy of these,
but again, California one too,
[SPEAKER_16]: because California took a lot from there
is around that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause and that's one of the, that's one of
the biggest actually, I think shifts in
[SPEAKER_16]: testing and what's coming is, is it really
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how you handle the sample and how,
how sample error is assessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you get a, I think we've talked
about this on hash church before,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when you get a positive result,
so you're automatically sort of put back
[SPEAKER_02]: into the testing queue for that sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously if that sample itself in the
sample preparation, the analytical sample
[SPEAKER_02]: preparation was contaminated because
someone used the dirty glove or against
[SPEAKER_02]: someone rubbed up against the dog that had
some ear medicine on it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, I mean, whatever contamination
that can come into the pets is likely not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where everything's nice and pristine
pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the process of getting that sample
from the grow or, you know, the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: making lab into the analytical test
itself, because there's such an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity, especially, especially when
you're talking about microbial fouling,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we live in a microbial world,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just to microbial contaminate,
let alone a dead sample of flower or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, hash or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause hash is so sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could imagine it just sticks to
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and again, so sample handling has a
lot to do with tightening up the
[SPEAKER_02]: reliability of testing results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's everyone's job.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower, the hash maker, the guy in
packaging, the guy whose business it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's everyone's job to make sure that the
sample handling for these tests are done
[SPEAKER_02]: with the best handling practices and to
make sure that they're not being
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated in transit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and because of, because of like,
uh, you know, how crucial the sampling
[SPEAKER_16]: handling procedure kind of is for the
overall integrity of testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, it's kind of, you know,
the testing is kind of being split
[SPEAKER_16]: essentially into two different ways.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there's the, there's the,
like, there's going to be the R and D type
[SPEAKER_16]: testing that's done, you know,
by people to develop products and to
[SPEAKER_16]: screen for pesticides to make sure they
don't go into your extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, getting products ready to go
to the market.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, and, and so that's going to
be separate.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there's this, the quote state
certified sampling and testing,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is going to basically be,
there's a state certified sampling agent
[SPEAKER_16]: that is an employee of a laboratory that
is going to go out to a distributor or
[SPEAKER_16]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, there's going to be these set
up, you know, 10 pound batches that,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the, the, uh, certain state
certified sampling agent has to take a
[SPEAKER_16]: statistically valid sampling
representative sample of the batch in this
[SPEAKER_16]: specific way.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and there's all these, you know,
very immense protocols and procedures and
[SPEAKER_16]: handling and chain of custody,
you know, and, and so, and then after the
[SPEAKER_16]: sampling is done on each of these batches,
you know, uh, the, the eight agent of lab
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of goes and puts tamper proof ceiling
on each one of the, the, the bags,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, and then kind of, you know,
gets it into the lab's possession to then,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, go into this process,
uh, through to sample prep test.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then upon the release of results that
are clean, you know, then, then that's a
[SPEAKER_16]: sound that, that those batches tested are,
you know, deemed state, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: certified to be able to then go into the
recreational medical market.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and so, so, so, you know, right now,
um, you know, without the, us as a lab
[SPEAKER_16]: actually going out and physically taking
the sample, you know, there's,
[SPEAKER_16]: um, you know, we, it's very hard for us to
certify or test anything beyond what the
[SPEAKER_16]: gram is we're testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, and so, you know,
often that's one of the biggest issues in
[SPEAKER_16]: the market is somebody will test something
clean.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and, you know, and then oftentimes
represent a lot of, you know, lower
[SPEAKER_16]: quality or dirty or herb under this one
result that's clean, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: in an effort to get it out in the market,
you know, and so, um, yeah, so,
[SPEAKER_16]: so it's just one of those things where,
you know, sampling is such a big part of
[SPEAKER_16]: the overall process for the integrity of,
um, you know, what is being sampled is
[SPEAKER_16]: actually what's being represented and is,
you know, what's being tested.
[SPEAKER_23]: That state certified agent seems like a
beautiful solution to that problem because
[SPEAKER_23]: instead of the oil producer, the bud
tender, whoever is handling that product,
[SPEAKER_23]: you have somebody who's requiring it to
be, you know, say a homogenous sample of
[SPEAKER_23]: oil, it's a fantastic system.
[SPEAKER_23]: It seems a lot better again than what
we've got here.
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like it's going to, there's going
to be huge bottleneck with it,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, and kind of like anticipate
having, you know, depends on how well it's
[SPEAKER_23]: funded and how many of those agents they
have, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_23]: If they see enough revenue from the tax
money, they should be able to find enough
[SPEAKER_23]: people to come take care of it.
[SPEAKER_23]: That will hopefully prevent a big
bottleneck there.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to have to be very talented
to be able to really properly sample a one
[SPEAKER_15]: pound or 10 pound or a hundred pound lot.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's not so simple.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really perplexed honestly on how it's
going to kind of unfold and how much,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, everybody's going to be learning
and figuring out the process along the
[SPEAKER_16]: way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause it doesn't seem like it can maybe
that boy, that's going to be a tough job.
[SPEAKER_15]: For somebody who doesn't have hands on
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed it will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what gentlemen,
it's after one o'clock, we rocked a solid
[SPEAKER_05]: four hours on this incredible three year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everyone for showing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously samurai Sam, Mark Sheldon,
skunk man Sam and Alec from SC labs who
[SPEAKER_05]: are still in the room, but everyone that
showed up throughout the episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all so much for coming and
sharing your vibes with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everyone who's watching as
always.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will bid you all farewell till next
week where I hope to see a bunch more of
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for coming everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: Big ups man.
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations on three year.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: Happy three years.
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for keeping this knowledge sharing
platform going bubble man.
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll take more dabs next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
Thank you.
