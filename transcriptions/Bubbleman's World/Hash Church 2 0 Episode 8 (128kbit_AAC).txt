[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Hash Church 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode, I don't know, eight maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of lost track.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit once we took some long
breaks, I was just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number is the number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everyone for joining us this
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very stoked to see a good group of the
regular chatters in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I still to this day after
several hundred episodes of Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_03]: get a little bit of butterflies in my
stomach.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how much it means to me to do an
episode of Hash Church each day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always want it to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never want it to be bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a responsibility in it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess without further ado,
I will send out the links to our group.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have quite a few people this Sunday
afternoon or morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be 14 plus of us that get
the invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So only a fraction of us are going to be
able to come into the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send that, send that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I'm sure we can rotate
and I'm sure if some people want to come
[SPEAKER_03]: in and they don't get a chance,
other people can leave the room for a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have sent the rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that not go through?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I might have to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, bear with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a little bit of a technical
difficulty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just make sure I've done this
correctly so we can get everyone in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, the old Hash Church intensities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this isn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to do this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Sabo, Sarah, John, Wendy,
Darren, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear with me, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to get these invitations sent
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did send the email out and that worked
fine, but for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's saying there's no participants in
this other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Sarah Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Sabo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Angel Vasquez.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Mark Chaldone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren Massey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can find the no
participants one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Wendy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't want to forget Wendy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't want to forget Yow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to send it right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if that doesn't work because
that was everyone that said they wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: be in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's a little bit difficult when
you set up the private message in Facebook
[SPEAKER_03]: to send out these chats.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get a message, it can mess things up
for me, but hopefully, yeah, hopefully
[SPEAKER_03]: that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, in the meantime, while I'm waiting
for everyone to come into the room because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all alone here on Hash Church,
we've got 254 viewers in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got back from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that were paying any
attention, I was in Amsterdam in Leiden,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, Holland for the International
Cannabinoid Research Society, and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: very cool, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to be in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk a little bit about it once we
get some folks in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of funny to have this happen where
it's just, I've never had it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saying there's no participants in the
room, but well, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if anyone's going to get in here
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird that this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not letting me send a single message.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Johnny Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some people coming in now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the loud guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's Mark coming in loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Farmer Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Jow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Mark Sheldon, Dr. Mark Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got Sabo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer John's just working it out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's under his umbrella there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez, I felt like I was all alone there
for a while, guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to mute Farmer John for a second
while he's fixing his camera there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming in a bit hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I could have worn headphones,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even letting me mute you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you guys aren't talking,
definitely mute your own microphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it a lot easier and better
because there's no noise.
Sabo!
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you at, Sabo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just setting up my camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting up the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade's in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: The house of laughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The house of smiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B, please mute your mic,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, when you're moving everything
around like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you muted, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not quite everyone, but the first
four or five people that I've invited.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: For whatever reason, it's not letting me
mute Farmer Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're playing around with your
microphone and you're moving things
[SPEAKER_03]: around, just mute your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Telephones tend to be the loudest.
[SPEAKER_03]: iPads tend to be the loudest because your
microphone is literally right on your
[SPEAKER_03]: camera there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do welcome you all into the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will kind of give some introductions to
some new faces here in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure that everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You obviously got the link, Mark,
from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just unmuting myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does my mic sound?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic sounds wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great to hear you and great to see this
panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy to see you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of a spur of the moment last
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, every Sunday, every Saturday
night, Sundays come around and I always
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of, you know,
do we have a good group of people to meet
[SPEAKER_03]: up and have a good dialogue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's dialogue is really kind of an open
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no particular topic, but I have
invited a very sort of well-rounded group
[SPEAKER_03]: of individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to go through the group real quick,
I've got Eric who's come in from Pure
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressure, who I've gotten to know quite a
bit over the last year after using their
[SPEAKER_03]: Long Peaks unit and doing a couple of
shows with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Farmer Tom, who came in a while ago
for one of our, oh, geez, was it our
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse show that you were on,
Farmer Tom?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even remembering which episode it
was that you came and joined us for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the greenhouse show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got Farmer Tom in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Wade, of course, from the
Colladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Forrest is going to be popping
in a little bit later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope your back's doing better,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're feeling better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have Jau, who is a new friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: He reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jau is really the sort of the person
behind Ganja Talks and the Bubble Man
[SPEAKER_03]: solventless extraction course that we're
going to be doing here in the next little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of started it with a four-part
series of free courses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've just been super stoked with the
professionalism that he's displayed so far
[SPEAKER_03]: with his team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it would be kind of a cool
idea to bring him in and have a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of a talk about that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Johnny B., who needs no
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good old Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have Sarah Sunday, who just popped
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah someone, actually, here on Google
Chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sarah, of course, runs the Karma Cup,
which, what has it been, four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: years now, Sarah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we on four?
Five?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Sarah can hear me,
but she's working on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we'll be talking a little bit
about the upcoming Karma Cup in September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, my good friend Sabo
is also in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Creator of the Vapix Hail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This little unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How sweet are these little units here?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure Sabo's always got great things
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all the things that he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the most important things that I
wanted to discuss with him today was sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of the cannabis parenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parent, a cannabis entrepreneur,
parenting young children in this day and
[SPEAKER_03]: age and sort of just get an open
discussion going on on somewhat of the
[SPEAKER_03]: difficulties of that, but also the
obstacles that we need to overcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, parenting is a whole
different trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really just all about what you
yourself are into and what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like, but you also have this
responsibility to your children to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that you don't put them in a
situation that causes them embarrassment
[SPEAKER_03]: or creates obstacles for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought we would have a little
conversation about that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I've pretty much introduced
everyone so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Mark Sheldon needs no introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was crushing it on the last few hash
churches.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like Dr. Mark Church,
we could have called it after the last
[SPEAKER_03]: science one where he went.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just dropped the power knowledge ball
on his hydrogenation process and some
[SPEAKER_03]: other interesting things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very happy to have you all here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really sure who to open it up with,
how to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll talk a little bit about the
ICRS, which Mark you should absolutely go
[SPEAKER_03]: to in the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be an event designed for
you with all your peers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was a little bit over my
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first day was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome Skunkman Sam into the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you saw the picture
of me with Sam I am on my lap there about
[SPEAKER_03]: a week ago when I was at his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Sam doing his thing, sitting all
happy with his little boa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was Sam of course and Chimera
who really inspired me Chimera more than
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone to head out to the ICRS this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my first one that I've ever been to
and Sam kind of warned me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, you know, the first day or two
will be really good and very cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant related.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it'll go deep into the
endocannabinoid study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as, as it did, it totally got super
deep, turned into some hard core,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, science where they're testing on
lab rats and mice and monkeys and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both myself and Ian, who I was with
from Cegar International, we're having a
[SPEAKER_03]: borderline difficult time with that aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure many of you remember some of the
first times Dr. Natasha came in and
[SPEAKER_03]: started talking a little bit about the
mice studies from a cannabis person's
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somewhat shocking because generally
most of us aren't sitting around torturing
[SPEAKER_03]: mice into figuring out how cannabinoid
receptors work, but this is happening out
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, these people join annually
at the International Cannabinoid Research
[SPEAKER_03]: Society, an exceptional group of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to admit, there were some
wonderful people there that I got to hang
[SPEAKER_03]: out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will probably, you know,
make an attempt to make it there next
[SPEAKER_03]: year, depending on where it is,
unless it's in America, in which case I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have to maybe just read the footnotes,
nothing against my American brethren and
[SPEAKER_03]: sistren, just terrified of your government
is all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so are we.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to start with politics this early in
the morning, we can finish it right at
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, wonderful group of people at the
ICRS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, you should definitely 100% make an
attempt on heading out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I totally need to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told for many years I need to
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tamara tried to sink me in this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my wife's birthday and we went and
saw a tray in Central Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you post a picture of asking,
what was it, 22 or 23 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: you asked her to marry you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that happened in Soldier Field
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before Jerry Garcia died in 1995,
I asked my wife to marry me, not knowing
[SPEAKER_05]: that just a little over a month later,
Jerry would be gone and our lives would
[SPEAKER_05]: take a different direction from that point
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: But forever impacted on the fact that I
lived during the time of Jerry Garcia in
[SPEAKER_05]: my lifetime was just amazing that I got to
see so many of his concerts and it had
[SPEAKER_05]: such a profound effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus, I don't know if you know,
but I used to play in a Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_05]: cover band.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I met my wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I remind children all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't for Jerry Garcia,
you guys wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that as a lead into your parenting
thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a perfect lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not really my parenting thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a conversation started on his
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one that I was going to be a
part of, but it kind of got canceled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to have a good discussion
about cannabis entrepreneurs, cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: growers and cannabis parenting?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say, Sabo?
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it been going with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're on mute there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to unmute your mic there and then
we'll get you happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to make sure that I wasn't
causing feedback, but I didn't know how to
[SPEAKER_12]: unmute my own microphone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So things are going really well out here
in California.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't want to say really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a bunch of compliance issues and
things that everyone is taking care of
[SPEAKER_12]: that various levels of headaches,
depending on where you are in the supply
[SPEAKER_12]: chain.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at least for me, with the can of
parenting and the can of dads,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's been going along really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems that, you know, 18 months ago,
when we first started it, it was met with
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot more resistance, you know,
a lot of people were very surprised that I
[SPEAKER_12]: would be open about talking about my
cannabis use while, you know, at a PTA
[SPEAKER_12]: meeting and over the last year and a half,
you know, things have definitely changed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of the other parents have become
proponents of the cannabis movement here
[SPEAKER_12]: in California.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not just, you know, me telling a
bunch of people, but it's a group of
[SPEAKER_12]: people telling other parents.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact is, you know, I live in the
Silicon Valley and a lot of the parents
[SPEAKER_12]: here are cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are all kind of coming together and
figuring out, A, you know, how do we talk
[SPEAKER_12]: to our children about, you know,
the shift in the state where it was,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, medical last year and now it's
adult use.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also just to, you know,
help the other parents who maybe have not
[SPEAKER_12]: consumed since their college days,
you know, understand how to put on the
[SPEAKER_12]: training wheels and get accustomed to
cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've actually been seeing quite a few
parents, you know, switch from,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, having a beer or a glass of
wine, you know, after work to now,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, maybe getting a vape pen and
taking a couple puffs of CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I've seen a lot of change
over the last 18 months and it's been
[SPEAKER_12]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a conversation for the
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that when I first had my children
17 plus years ago, it was not a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation that I was personally willing
to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more like this closet thing,
hiding it in the closet, much like what
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuban just said right now in the chat
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, wow, I would never share that
with the school system or parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to show you that there's this vibe
of fear and that's really the thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be sort of deconstructed and
removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't be afraid to have this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we've all come from this sort
of gray, not all of us, but a lot of us
[SPEAKER_03]: have come from this gray area situation
where, you know, fighting for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: today is much different than fighting for
cannabis 20 plus years ago, where they
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of had this no zero tolerance thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going on where they just, you know,
arrest you and throw away the key type of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people did lots of time for
cannabis over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we owe it to ourselves and to
our communities to sort of be that strong
[SPEAKER_03]: voice that says, look, I know I'm not
doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not breaking any laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us now have medical licenses and
are protected in that sense that we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to have this conversation,
particularly about and with our children
[SPEAKER_03]: in regards to cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And welcome to Forrest, who just came in,
who has, of course, a very unique
[SPEAKER_03]: background in the sense of, you know,
not having any fear whatsoever about
[SPEAKER_03]: having this discussion because,
you know, his foundation is even it's even
[SPEAKER_03]: more harsh than a lot of us who are just
trying to protect our healthy children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forrest, of course, has a very sick child
who's been suffering for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is a huge alleviation to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And any parent who's going to be put in a
situation where they're going to be in
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble from the police or they're going
to keep their child from potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: perishing, it makes it a very easy
decision, which is I'm going to fight for
[SPEAKER_03]: my child's rights to be able to be as
healthy as possible and to improve the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of their lives before I'm going to
be worried.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It boils down to fear and scarcity and
love and abundance and what side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: coin you want to fall on for the choices
that you make in the direction that your
[SPEAKER_03]: life is going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear and scarcity is something that sucks
a lot of us into often, and it's very easy
[SPEAKER_03]: to be like, oh, I would never I don't want
to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to stay under the radar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's that love and abundance
vibe, which is like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to hear about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have this discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bottom line is that a lot of
people do use cannabis and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, imagine we live in a day and age
where you'd want to be afraid of your
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis use, whereas you could be a proud
abuser of alcohol and almost have never
[SPEAKER_03]: any negative consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like somewhat of a social
tear on a tear on the social fabric of our
[SPEAKER_03]: very communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, for one, am excited to get a little
bit into this conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps, Forrest, you want to give us a
little bit of a little bit of an update
[SPEAKER_03]: with what's going on with you and Silas
and tell us about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parenting and cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it's good to see you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just hit it right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, again, like you said,
for those who don't know, I have a child
[SPEAKER_01]: who has a rare seizure disorder called
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the two approved seizure
conditions for the Epidiolex drug that's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a whole bunch of attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first FDA cannabinoid based approved
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the conditions are so serious,
essentially, I mean, these kids have
[SPEAKER_01]: intractable catastrophic forms of
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't respond to other types of
medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know because those medications
don't interact and adjust the right
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor systems in the body to correct
the problems, unlike cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, from the very beginning,
we've had to fight this stigma,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with children and cannabis and
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been kind of on the front lines
of that battle for, you know, 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've really had to help shift the
cultural understanding of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that has to do with
addressing just what you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fears and stigmas that are surrounding
cannabis and having to really address them
[SPEAKER_01]: one by one based on their merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what we found is that when
we started doing research, because now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're getting into wanting to give our own
child cannabis, which is a lot different
[SPEAKER_01]: than me wanting to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real different decision giving it
to your kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting people to approve allowing us
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to look at all the science and
research surrounding cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding its perceived harm,
everything from IQ and cognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: development to stunting brain growth to
neuronatal use in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found going into it,
really wanting to know what the real risks
[SPEAKER_01]: are with my own child was that you really
start to see how bias and poor a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the science is that sets out to
demonstrate harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really found that there was very
little evidence to support a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stigmas and fears that come around or that
are applied to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all know that when you use
cannabis and you use it frequently and
[SPEAKER_01]: people who use cannabis medicinally,
their brains work a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while, it changes the way
receptors work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greatest studies, the most respected
studies show, you know, that cannabis can
[SPEAKER_01]: impact the way you think, you know,
for up to two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If with heavy use, you know, the effects
might last up to two weeks afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they've demonstrated is maybe a
one or two point decrease in IQ,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if we can get into the question of
IQ, if those tests are valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they've shown is that,
you know, the maximum amount of harm they
[SPEAKER_01]: could demonstrate was that, you know,
people will have an affected way of
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking for maybe two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that affected way of thinking
and changing the way the brain works is
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly where a lot of the benefit comes
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we didn't understand with the
effects of memory and short-term memory
[SPEAKER_01]: are now a lot of the things that we're
finding are what applies to correcting
[SPEAKER_01]: issues like PTSD with endocannabinoid
deficiency disorders and other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we embrace that there was really
zero long-term or permanent harm
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrated with cannabis, we were able
to start really discussing that on a more
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific level working with kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we work with kids full-time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have children who are on doses of 2,500
milligrams a day and show zero long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their bodies adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It corrects the issues that are not
functioning well in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've actually seen the exact opposite
of what is proposed to have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the theory is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That if kids are using cannabis,
then they're not going to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: cognitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're going to see decreases in IQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stunt their brain
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing across the board is
the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see when the body starts to be able to
regulate electrical signaling and
[SPEAKER_01]: neurotransmitter function correctly,
the brain functions in a more healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see increases in IQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see increases in cognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see kids often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it sounds like nonsense
until you're actually working with these
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see children who couldn't speak
prior to using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, are you doing that by oral?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, with kids, everything's oral and
suspensions and measured dosing,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically three or four times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goals being to keep sustained levels
in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a supplement to try to
correct or, or mitigate issues based on
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, uh, oral suspensions,
measured doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those high doses,
well, they used to be rare, but now with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the Epidiolex trials, the kids
coming to us are coming to us with
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended from their doctors,
not just random doctors off the street,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the head of, you know, neurology at
Stanford and UCSF large clinics that have
[SPEAKER_01]: worked with this drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are now recommending starting doses for
kids, primarily focused on CBD because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all they can work with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But starting it, starting at 10,
15 milligrams per pound body weight and
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly having them recommend even higher
up to 25 milligrams per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a kid come to us the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get kids who are coming with
doctor's notes saying, Hey, my child's
[SPEAKER_01]: nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He weighs a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys help us sustain a 2,500
milligram a day dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we, we see that more and more,
and I think we're, that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble that bursts a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those large doses, some of that is
because the medical establishment is only
[SPEAKER_01]: working with CBD and when you start
integrating other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to interrupt, but, um, at 2,500
milligrams a day, I mean, how,
[SPEAKER_12]: or does that make it cost ineffective?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, just cost per milligram
wise, I was doing the math in my head and
[SPEAKER_12]: it seems like, I mean, I give,
my kids significantly less.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they have a less severe,
um, issues, but I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how do people make that work
economically?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, you know, that's that,
that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't, um, with, with some of
the work and maybe we'll get into it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little later that we're doing with
legislation here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've recently gone to a bunch of
dispensaries just to get what is available
[SPEAKER_01]: and what does that play out to in the real
world if parents are trying to meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended doses that doctors are asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just recently, you know,
we were looking for the only full plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that we could find that had all
the necessary requirements, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper testing results, proper labeling
for dosage, you know, the right
[SPEAKER_01]: credibility to use on, on young kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 300 milligrams and it was 80
bucks, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at, in reality,
if people, if people treating rare
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, in, in trying to follow the
recommendations of these doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're needing to spend, you know,
one, the kids will have to drink five to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight of those bottles a day just to reach
the sustained dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the cost of,
you know, somewhere anywhere between 800
[SPEAKER_01]: and $1,200 a day to make that,
make that dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people will point to like,
well, there's these other products on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market that are 1500 milligram tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing very few whole full
spectrum plant products being put out at
[SPEAKER_01]: those doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of isolate products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems the quality seems to go down with
some of these products is the dosage level
[SPEAKER_01]: goes up and the efficacy goes down with
them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're not, uh, if they don't carry
the medical efficacy necessary,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to where we're not seeing the results,
then we have to go down to the full plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are lower doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes, you know, it's just not,
it's not doable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the real differences in
efficacy between whole plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically meteor distillate based
products that are sort of very much so
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause so that, that would be, again,
I I'm trying to understand the nature of
[SPEAKER_05]: all the other ingredients that are in
there other than the cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_05]: adding, adding the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are everything else that's being
extracted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so this is where we get into the
unknown, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, for my believer, just from
anecdotal evidence, I am 100% a believer
[SPEAKER_01]: of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think obviously we're still learning
some of the interactions and modifications
[SPEAKER_01]: of terpenes due to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen it firsthand where we have
kids on say like a strain, like ACDC is a
[SPEAKER_01]: good universal type three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, low THC strain that we use high CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but at times we run out, it doesn't
grow well in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to keep, keep the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's a fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but cannabinoid profile, uh,
exact same doses, uh, different strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the strain was Electra,
the last one that we had a really bad
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction and we've seen kids have go from
seizure control to in the hospital with
[SPEAKER_01]: the changes in strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so again, yeah, that leads to that
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is available?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another problem right now with some
of the commercial marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just shopping based on CBD and THC,
but rarely can in some stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just, it's just harder to find
harder to find sustainable, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: single strain full plant because it does
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we've just seen, you know,
I've seen, you know, some of the baby it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the more we purify CBD,
the less effective it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the science shows with almost every
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you see moderate or you
might see some benefits, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with kids who are in hospice or
having, you know, 2,500, 3000 seizures a
[SPEAKER_01]: month, then, you know, dropping it by 10%
is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that CBD isolate is safe and clean
and you drop it by 10%, well, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, but that's where people I think
confuse the potential that is in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: with just some efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start trying a product, they see a
little bit of benefit and they stick with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you're able to really start
to dial in the cannabinoid profile that
[SPEAKER_01]: best meets the malfunctioning need of that
unique brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all sorts of different things can go
wrong that cause the ECS to not function
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start to really dial in what
works for that brain, then you start
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing efficacy into the 50%, 60%,
up to 80 and 90% percent percentile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as simple as black and white
when people talk about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think that causes some
confusion online where they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I've tried this product and it did
good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really try to get people to
think about, well, okay, what does good
[SPEAKER_01]: for you look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your baseline?
[SPEAKER_01]: What percentage of increase and benefit
did you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you satisfied there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there better potential out there with a
higher quality product or continuing to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with different profiles that might,
you might respond better as an individual?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to go, I wanted to go back
real quick about, in regards to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what they say is going to happen
to the brain when you use cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_03]: youth or whatnot, some of the tests that
they use to acquire these results,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're not testing humans per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after going to the ICRS and listening
to a lot of these different sort of tests
[SPEAKER_03]: and scientific experiments they put
forward, you know, the ones that were
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsored by NIDA, the National Institute
of Drug Abuse were very negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, you know, my friend and I,
Ian, had a hard time sitting through them
[SPEAKER_03]: and watching them torture these rats,
blowing like the equivalent of multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: kilos in vapor into these cages where the
rats are just getting inundated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to, this test in particular
was on how the offspring of animals are
[SPEAKER_03]: affected by cannabis use, but they use the
most extreme level and not oral,
[SPEAKER_03]: but vapor, blowing vapor into these rats'
faces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then coming up with these results that
said, oh, you know, the children were
[SPEAKER_03]: unable to walk, the offspring were unable
to walk properly and have all these sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of negative connotations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was sitting in the audience
thinking, I wonder if the torture of the
[SPEAKER_03]: parents in a gas chamber had anything to
do with the outcome of how these small
[SPEAKER_03]: offspring react.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's laughable for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's insane that that's kind of how
some of this information is collected for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to use in arguments against or,
you know, the use of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: developing minds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, once again, it's pretty hard to
argue with the fact someone's having two
[SPEAKER_03]: to 3000 seizures a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly, you know, you hit the
right cannabinoid profile and you bring
[SPEAKER_03]: that down 90%.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you hit the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we see mostly when you look at
these studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to see two problems that jump out
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mark might have some insight into that
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, they have, they either use
dosages that are just not real world
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They give the equivalent of hundreds of
pounds of use, you know, to into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these animals, or they don't account for
comorbidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the human trials, they, you know,
especially if we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: natal use in pregnancy, they don't account
for alcohol or tobacco use and in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things you may have welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things that, that are people
have to take into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does, it makes it hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes our fight back to working with
children primarily, and trying to educate
[SPEAKER_01]: the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it much more difficult because,
you know, it's hard to teach people to
[SPEAKER_01]: read past the headlines, let alone read
past the abstract on a study, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even the abstracts can be slanted
towards where the funding came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get into the study itself,
you really see the full picture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, one of them that I
mentioned, you know, saying that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: can lower the IQ, heavy cannabis use or
THC use can lower the IQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the title says that,
the abstract says that, but you get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: reading of the study, and they show that
the doses were extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worst case scenario they could
find was that the effects lasted for 10 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 days and that there were no permanent
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that to me shows that,
yeah, if you're using heavy amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, your brain is going to start to
function a little differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't demonstrate harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just read the title and just
read the abstract, you know, they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I've got something to support my
argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it really challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is, is that the,
all we have to do is look at what matters
[SPEAKER_01]: and compare them to the side effects of
cannabis and what's been demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if we accept some side effects
that really I think can be questioned at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point, but if we give them the
benefit of doubt and accept some side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, we're going to see that it is
still the safest and best treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: option, not just for efficacy,
but for potential long-term harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take a 2% or a two point IQ
decrease in my son, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: who already has developmental delays is
going to live and need caring for his
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can tell me the difference between
a 72 IQ and a 70 IQ versus living and
[SPEAKER_01]: dead, then maybe you can argue that this
isn't a safe treatment option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at the other medications
that are provided for a lot of these kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's some kids, there's some people
here who popped in who might be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at the side effects and you
live with those side effects from damage
[SPEAKER_01]: to internal testings, liver damage,
behavioral and mood changes, weight gain,
[SPEAKER_01]: the list of Stephen Johnson syndrome,
I mean, the list of effects that come with
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of these medications are documented
and real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if we say, I mean, it seems like
the bar for cannabis has been set as it
[SPEAKER_01]: either has to be harmless or it's going to
kill you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we look at the side effects,
we start to understand them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we compare those to what our other
treatment options are and then compare
[SPEAKER_01]: those to the efficacy that they provide,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to really speak pretty deep in
ideology than us is when treating these
[SPEAKER_01]: kids or yourself or any adult.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to give, hi everyone,
I'm a patient, I have a epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_11]: so I would like to talk a little bit about
myself, about this issue, I think like
[SPEAKER_11]: makes totally sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a epilepsy since I'm 16 years
old, I was against cannabis for long
[SPEAKER_11]: period of my life, I'm from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here is like really strict,
really dangerous that say this way to
[SPEAKER_11]: relate with cannabis because of the cartel
and all those things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I realized that cannabis was good for
me when I was, it was like five years ago,
[SPEAKER_11]: I was living in a bedroom with no
soundproof and lightproof and I had like,
[SPEAKER_11]: my life was completely just about taking
really hard medicine and like just like
[SPEAKER_11]: having a totally different life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I start to consume cannabis every
day, my life changed totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like how my life was like, I could have a
normal life like go out with my friends,
[SPEAKER_11]: like do all those things that I couldn't
do for like so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I come from that really conservative
family in Brazil, this is really like
[SPEAKER_11]: religious side is really huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing related to parental thing as
well is my family, when they saw the
[SPEAKER_11]: results of like using cannabis every day,
they saw that I got really, really better
[SPEAKER_11]: soon of using.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they changed it all like their main
mentality because they could see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They could see that I was getting better
every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my experience that I'd like to share
with you guys is like when a parent,
[SPEAKER_11]: when a father and a mother see that you
get better, doesn't matter which is like
[SPEAKER_11]: the medicine, you see the results in
epilepsy as I like have since I'm a kid.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really like a strong illness,
you know, you need to like, it's
[SPEAKER_11]: unbelievable that like in Brazil,
even in some countries in Latin America,
[SPEAKER_11]: we still have this policy against
cannabis, even I seen the great results
[SPEAKER_11]: that sorry to intershare that because I'm
a patient, I think it's good to share
[SPEAKER_11]: experience that I have with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Joe, for sharing and welcome to
Wendy and Colton Turner, who have just
[SPEAKER_03]: come into the room at a perfect time as
we're discussing sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: parenting and cannabis use, not only in
the situation that the conversation turned
[SPEAKER_03]: to, which was actually giving your
children cannabis, but also under the
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation or the dialogue of being a
parent who uses cannabis, maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinally or recreationally for yourself
and having children and the sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: obstacles that are needed to be overcome
throughout the, you know, how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: discuss that with your children?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you hide it from the schools and from
the parents and the friends or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: something that we're at a time now where
we can open this dialogue and be a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more open about it, but really welcome
to both of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see you and I hear you guys
made a pretty big move recently.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, for the first time in four years
because of the laws in the state of
[SPEAKER_10]: Illinois and because I'm able to get the
medicine that I use here, I've been
[SPEAKER_10]: finally able to move from Colorado back to
my home state of Southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fantastic, but the reality is,
is that there's still a lot of patients
[SPEAKER_10]: who are also stuck in states, you know,
like Colorado that can't move back home
[SPEAKER_10]: because they don't have access or,
you know, patients that can't move to
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado in the first place simply
because, you know, they don't have,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, the kind of money or anything to
make that kind of move.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a really big decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: And parents are still getting prosecuted
for giving their kids silly little things
[SPEAKER_07]: like THC or I say silly little things like
THC because I don't think it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: But silly little things like CBD,
you know, CBD is, I mean, come on people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it helps with no kind of crazy
side effects at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that people just really need
to start waking up and I think they have,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people are getting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think law enforcement is really the
issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: That they don't want to let go of what
they have invested in the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that parents have kind of
changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was against cannabis from,
you know, since I was little and raised in
[SPEAKER_07]: Southern Illinois and, you know,
thought that all cannabis or all marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: was bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Colton got sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my eyes opened and I changed my mind
and I changed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I did like a 720.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still I'm still spinning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the the efficacy of the cannabis
plants on so many of these diseases that
[SPEAKER_07]: these kids have is so grand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people don't you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: People want to say, you know, grab those
headlines that THC drops your IQ.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have I would rather have an a
motivational kid or a kid like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that had a 73 and now is a 70 IQ
than a dead kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and that is just exactly what this is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think morphine makes his IQ drop?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there studies on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't looked at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've been put on medications that
have way worse side effects than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I was on one medication.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could cause, you know, five different
forms of cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're concerned about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't even FDA approved for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they put it on anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of this stuff is just, you know,
still the the reefer madness mentality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of parents have it and a lot of
legislators have it still.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got back from Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_07]: about a month and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they we talked to one legislator that
was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bad for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't we think it's a horrible drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to have anything to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I'm sitting here thinking,
OK, my kid has been on this for four
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he started this when he was actually
13, but religiously at 14.
[SPEAKER_07]: 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's still developing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He still has a developing brain and he's
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I remember when you told the story
initially how he was absolutely not
[SPEAKER_03]: developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was wasting away to nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you started giving him cannabis,
he actually started developing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was in failure to thrive or means
behind in growth for means behind in
[SPEAKER_07]: growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was in failure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Failure to thrive is is like he is not
growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not his cognitive issues are being
decreased.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is wasting away his the protein and his
muscles are wasting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And progress as developing as a human
being was basically rendered down to zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now he's 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's speaking at all these crazy events
and with such intelligence and and he's
[SPEAKER_07]: taller than me now.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wasn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was way shorter than me four years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, he's a normal kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's shoveling snow.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's riding his bike.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that he can't do is drive a
car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say he's above normal and he's
quite exceptional.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wendy, what daily dose is he getting right
now?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I take so right now I take a medicine
that, you know, I helped formulate with a
[SPEAKER_10]: company called Mary's Medicinals.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a medicine called the remedy one
to one by Colton.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's exactly what I take.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we also like to dose it
differently.
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, I like to take, you know,
15 milligrams of both CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I take that oil and then I put them
into little pill capsules that I order off
[SPEAKER_10]: of Amazon or or buy at the local
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would put them in pills and then I
take them like a pill four times a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a total of 60 milligrams of both CBD
and THC per day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are days where he can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he takes an extra dose of THC so he can
sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, he's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are days where he could be up to 150
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: But his normal regulated dose is 60
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Colton, how do you go about sort of
educating your school friends and the kids
[SPEAKER_03]: that your peers that are your age?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously it's a discussion that
you've probably had with more than a few
[SPEAKER_03]: of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that the discussion of
recreational versus medicinal comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you how do you navigate that sort
of that area?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say before before we get into
that, I want to say I don't feel like
[SPEAKER_07]: there is a recreational situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like there is a recreational
situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like recreational is over the
counter because I use cannabis for a bug
[SPEAKER_07]: bite or a headache or a sore muscle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like it's more, you know,
over the counter.
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't have a debilitating disease to
use it for, but it still benefits her.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can go to time and go to Wal-Mart
and you can get Tylenol and for your minor
[SPEAKER_07]: ailments and or you can go to the pharmacy
and get Tylenol 3 for your major ailments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like that's kind of what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's medicine across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I even would add a third option
to that, which it's preventative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should we wait till we get sick if we
can take something that can actually get
[SPEAKER_03]: our system into a nice, you know,
running order where it's like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: preventing potential sickness?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm a nutritional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we first started cannabis,
a lot of our friends and family,
[SPEAKER_10]: surprisingly, were very supportive.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, you know, were basically,
you know, our grandma and grandpa.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we were terrified that they were
going to, you know, ream us and,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, have these this long,
long lecture about how my parents are
[SPEAKER_10]: terrible people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they said, well, why aren't you in
Colorado right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why haven't you left yet?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, as we learn, you know,
because we didn't know we knew as just as
[SPEAKER_10]: much as they did.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the more that we learn about cannabis
and about the community and the industry
[SPEAKER_10]: surrounding it, the more we would talk to
them about it and educate them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just kind of a learning
process, because then they would get
[SPEAKER_10]: curious and then they would learn
something and then they would teach us
[SPEAKER_10]: about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a really great, you know,
circle of education when it comes to our
[SPEAKER_10]: friends and family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every one of Colton's grandparents takes
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the thing for the longest time you
had, you know, Rastafarians and hippies
[SPEAKER_03]: were the ones preaching this word,
and they were looked at as a down upon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people really wanted to listen to
nothing that they said.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now when you have a child who's going
to be educating you on this and not only
[SPEAKER_03]: just any child, but a child that
potentially actually saved their own lives
[SPEAKER_03]: and if not saved their own lives,
increased the quality of their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhat astronomically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're related to them and you
love you have love for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be much easier to hear that
that message that these same, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafarians have been singing about in
reggae music for 40 plus years and just
[SPEAKER_03]: being looked down upon, laughed,
laughed at, in fact, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've always said it from from the
state of view that young sick children are
[SPEAKER_03]: the last leg that prohibition has to stand
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's crumbling underneath them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this just takes apart their entire
argument of, oh, well, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I remember a friend of mine who was
suffering from from wasting syndrome from
[SPEAKER_03]: the AIDS medication he was on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he went to his doctor and the doctor
said, listen, you know, the the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis is going to is going to raise
your blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have you snacking on all
sorts of bad things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to you're going to
potentially have a high blood pressure,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a guy who was literally like
months away from dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is my doctor thinking telling me that I'm
going to get high blood pressure?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like on the cusp of death.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to eat food.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's what it was doing for
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the way it was with Bolton
completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on the cusp of cusp of death.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and we didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely hasn't raised his blood
pressure any.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I think that the stigma with all
the Rastafarians and the hippies were just
[SPEAKER_07]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, every day I thank God for those
people, because if they wouldn't have kept
[SPEAKER_07]: up with their fight and their love and
their passion for this plant, my my kid
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't be here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to we we really need to
respect those people and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: appreciate the the torment and the hell
that they went through trying to tell us
[SPEAKER_07]: the truth when we weren't listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just you know, I just have so much
respect for just anybody anymore because I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't care what they look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we we always get, oh,
you're the all American family.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are, you know, we we do we do look
like that all American family.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are able to walk into legislators
offices and get listened to because we you
[SPEAKER_07]: know, we look like that all American
family, which is so wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: We we have created this social stigma of
what you're supposed to look like and and
[SPEAKER_07]: what you're supposed to do and and how
you're supposed to act.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and I just I look back at
where the cannabis plant has come from and
[SPEAKER_07]: where it is now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was our Rastafarians.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was it was our hippies that that
brought it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I thank God for them every
single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know.
[SPEAKER_07]: How thankful and grateful I have been to
those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well said, Wendy, I agree as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, the keepers of the plant,
you know, who knows where this plant would
[SPEAKER_03]: be if it were if it wasn't for people who
are willing to, you know, not just people
[SPEAKER_03]: who are willing to, you know, make money
off prohibition, but people who are really
[SPEAKER_03]: new to the importance of protecting these
genetics and keeping them alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing people like Skunkman Sam,
who traveled the world to all the hash
[SPEAKER_03]: producing countries and collected seeds
and bred incredible medicinal cultivars,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, props to all of you guys who
have been doing this for for so many
[SPEAKER_03]: decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, Mark has called the question,
please hold in your medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like so it's a one to one THC CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you said it was?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's a isolated CBD and THC with
terpenes reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_05]: With terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you take it to control your
your medical condition, you also think
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can feel what's called
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you feel debilitated like dizzy
or, you know, the so-called high?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to understand whether or
not there's that sweet spot of having a
[SPEAKER_05]: efficacious treatment to control your
medical condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't create the high that
would maybe frighten some patients or keep
[SPEAKER_05]: some patients from wanting to try an
abinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first thing that I tell people
when they ask that is first not to be
[SPEAKER_10]: afraid of THC, because, you know,
if they're scared that, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's going to damage their kid's brain,
then why are other kids using it for their
[SPEAKER_10]: seizures?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I always say, well, you know,
what we did is we microdose.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we did is we took the oil that I
take and we started with a very small
[SPEAKER_10]: amount and we slowly, you know,
increase that dosage until, OK,
[SPEAKER_10]: if I go above this line, I'm going to feel
some kind of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to stay right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So our goal is basically to put as much
CBD and as much THC in my system as
[SPEAKER_10]: possible without feeling that
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and what what level is that for you
right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: And does that level change according to
patient or body weight or different
[SPEAKER_05]: medical condition?
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't we we haven't noticed that body
weight had had an issue with it when it
[SPEAKER_07]: comes to Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have noticed that Crohn's disease is
Crohn's disease is Crohn's disease in
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: They it's this it's the same mechanism
that's causing the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it has nothing to do with with weight
or or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you're male or female, we know a
little girl that that is taking 20
[SPEAKER_07]: milligrams per dose, which is five
milligrams higher than what Colton's is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we know a gentleman who's about
250 pounds that only takes five
[SPEAKER_07]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really my husband had a really good
analogy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has potholes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has their road that has their
potholes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe my potholes are, you know,
I have 10 and Colton only has eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe you have 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just need that amount of
cannabinoids to fill our potholes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a that's a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number of receptors, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your potholes are the little areas that
the molecules need to bind into,
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're saying is that a certain level
of disease or medical condition could
[SPEAKER_05]: affect the level of receptors or even our
own body's way of regulating the
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid system is by changing the
number of receptors and how those
[SPEAKER_05]: receptors are expressed during a variety
of different conditions, such as the
[SPEAKER_05]: inflammatory response, which is usually
just underpins a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: malfunction in the body when there is
inflammation and what the inflammation
[SPEAKER_05]: occurs from, whether it's from a wound or
whether it's from something in the diet or
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's from buildup of toxins,
there's all kinds of reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, like, Colton, you're a
perfect example of again, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: like sort of the use of cannabinoids as as
hormones, because hormones have an impact
[SPEAKER_05]: on growth and how your body is basically
looking for certain things in its diet and
[SPEAKER_05]: in nutrition to catalyze growth and to
catalyze the formation of new bone cells
[SPEAKER_05]: and new muscle cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And your whole experience that you had,
which was, again, that cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_05]: somehow at the at the point of catalyzing
that growth above and beyond your medical
[SPEAKER_05]: condition was just, you know, is is a real
testament to how again, I'll go back to
[SPEAKER_05]: something I interjected before when Marcus
was talking that these things are not only
[SPEAKER_05]: preventative, but they're nutritional.
[SPEAKER_05]: So CBD will be a fortified item in foods
for years to come from baby food through
[SPEAKER_05]: geriatric medicine, because it's a fat
soluble antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is doing preventative damage from
free radical mediated oxidation in fatty
[SPEAKER_05]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most antioxidants like vitamin C or
water soluble, they don't get into fatty
[SPEAKER_05]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortunately, the cannabinoids and body has
evolved mechanisms to hold on to them,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is why we can't pass a urine test
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows that our body is basically
holding on to these molecules because
[SPEAKER_05]: they're so useful and so beneficial to
fight fighting disease and fighting things
[SPEAKER_05]: like free radical mediated damage in fatty
tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in your pancreas and in your brain and
in any place where there's fatty tissue,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's cannabinoids if you're using them
and you're getting them at the right level
[SPEAKER_05]: to where basically their metabolic
products are being stored within your
[SPEAKER_05]: fatty and your edipous tissue,
which is actually helping you stay
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you burn that tissue, those are
released throughout your body and
[SPEAKER_05]: eventually excreted.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, the other question I wanted
to go back to Forrest and ask,
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we were talking a little bit
about distillate based products versus
[SPEAKER_05]: whole extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we had talked about this
on a previous episode of Hash Church
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest, where you were looking again for
different suppliers and looking at how it
[SPEAKER_05]: comes down to now the extraction process
that you're using if you're making a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: plant extract because the whole plant is
being extracted now and not all extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: processes are created equal, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have things like dry sift,
which is an extraction process where you
[SPEAKER_05]: have solvent methods where it dissolves
everything that's in the plant and brings
[SPEAKER_05]: it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm trying to understand from
Forrest is your plant extracts that are
[SPEAKER_05]: being used for your formulations,
are they ethanol based extracts?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're ethanol based extracts,
I like to get an idea of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are the other components that are
coming along for the ride that we should,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, look to see in other extraction
methods when we look at whole plant
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I do believe in everything that
you guys were saying about entourage
[SPEAKER_05]: effects and that there's a lot of soluble
and maybe not so soluble components that
[SPEAKER_05]: are being extracted in the extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to understand like what those
components are and how we could make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that those are in whole plant extracts
versus somebody just making distillate and
[SPEAKER_05]: adding it to some hemp seed oil or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, this is a great conversation
that I have some things to add on dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting a lot of questions on
the chat about different conditions and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get to that question first,
yes, we, I have become a diehard fan
[SPEAKER_01]: through trial and error and seeing what
works and what doesn't of cold ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: wash extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just the first run, get the ethanol
out, leave it as is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of really good
closed loop systems now with some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: extractors that are able to do large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old fashioned, you know, but quite
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roto Vaps, even though I've looked at some
of these other spray mist distillers and
[SPEAKER_01]: other things, that's another conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they're having, what they're
doing is they are providing what I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing to the other extraction methods
that we have available, barring some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the solvent free more work extractions
that we just don't have the ability to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just leave those out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of those as well,
but talking about CO2 and other sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: gas extractions, we get an oil that I
think represents the best we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant profile of the original
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you can tell right away by
how it smells, you know, when you feel,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you smell cold ethanol wash extract
versus others, you can still... So you're
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylating that oil or you're not
decarboxylating it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done both.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I found is I don't see too much of a
difference actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we go to the final test results,
and I think that has to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the heat involved and the time
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see a little bit more acidic
compounds, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see a lot of, a lot of transfer over
with what we're seeing anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically we decarboxylate,
but the more I do test runs and compare
[SPEAKER_01]: the tests, I'm wondering if I shouldn't
be, because we're not seeing too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we get a lot of that
decarboxylation through the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: process, unfortunately anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hasn't been too good for acidic
tinctures and acidic compounds that we
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what we're seeing is we're seeing
significant terpene levels that you lose
[SPEAKER_01]: further in the distillation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing as far as other
cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You continue to get, we see consistently,
you know, levels, even if they're small
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of CBG and other compounds in there
that I think play a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, really the main difference I
see is in the percentage of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's because we're limited
by what we're testing for still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel that there's a lot going on
that we're just not looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that in that other material,
other cannabinoids percentage on some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the tests that we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot there that we're
not aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've noticed, if I could boil it
down to one simple thing, is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene content is higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever else is in there is having an
effect that we're learning about now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it definitely, without a doubt,
when we try it in the real world,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a very significant difference in
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we stick to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as, you know, we're getting a
lot of questions on here about dosing and
[SPEAKER_01]: what works right for what conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking a little bit about
milligram dosing with Colton and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your question about, you know,
where is that level that seems to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, with working with over 190
children at this point, all the things
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done with my own son, I have seen
absolutely close to no consistent pattern
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever, with a few exceptions,
where we have conditions like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about Gervais syndrome and others
that have specific genetic markers that
[SPEAKER_01]: are tied to specific receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can start to get a little more,
we see a little more trends on what tends
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with those kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes, I think it goes back to
learning about kind of some of Dr. Russo's
[SPEAKER_01]: theories and others about an
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's so many
different things that can go wrong in the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of times we look at a
consequence and we try to determine what
[SPEAKER_01]: is necessary for that consequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if your endocannabinoid system
isn't functioning properly, and say the
[SPEAKER_01]: consequence of that poorly functioning
neurotransmitter and electro signal
[SPEAKER_01]: control is a seizure, right, or a
migraine, or an incident with IBS,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, or some other sort of flare up,
right, you can start to look at those
[SPEAKER_01]: incidences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we want to do is say,
well, there's the consequence,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've begun to feel, and I'd like
to hear your thoughts on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, looking at the lack of consistency
and reading, you know, and learning more
[SPEAKER_01]: about the ECS, it seems that that
consequence does not necessarily equate to
[SPEAKER_01]: causality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's several different things that
can go wrong in this system that will
[SPEAKER_01]: result in the same inability for the body
to not regulate neurotransmitter and
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical signaling properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could be not producing anandamide
into arachidinal glycerol or these other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid stressors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at a lot of the mental health
problems, it looks like a lot of it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be malformed CB1 and CB2 receptors so that
they can't bind properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could not be producing the enzyme
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we froze up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually if I wait a few, like 10 seconds,
it'll kind of unfreeze, but I guess
[SPEAKER_05]: Forrest will have to- I thought it was me
freezing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've blasted a few vapic sales here,
and I was also kind of like, is he coming
[SPEAKER_03]: back?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of frozen too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to jump in for a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, Mark, you said something that I
say a lot with the folks that I work with
[SPEAKER_09]: who need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something about a sweet spot,
and Colton, you made reference to this as
[SPEAKER_09]: well, where you get enough cannabis,
phyto cannabinoids into the bloodstream
[SPEAKER_09]: where you're seeing benefit for the
condition you're trying to treat while
[SPEAKER_09]: keeping the dose low enough that depending
on what your need is, the THC is not an
[SPEAKER_09]: issue for you, that person.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing that's fascinating about THC
and psychoactivity and whatnot is you can
[SPEAKER_09]: view it as a side effect that's
problematic, or you can view it as a side
[SPEAKER_09]: effect that is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in my case, I enjoy the
psychoactivity of THC, but to me,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's an undeniable benefit of CBD and
THC together.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that Colton's remedy that you
mentioned earlier is more or less equal
[SPEAKER_09]: parts CBD and THC, and I don't know about
the solvent type or the extraction that
[SPEAKER_09]: you're doing, but yeah, I would really
like to follow up with what he was,
[SPEAKER_09]: what Forrest was sharing about cold
ethanol and rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: He alluded to rosin, but pointed out how
much labor is involved in doing it,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we have already a lot of things going
on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm pretty sure that there's things
going on in the cannabis plant with all
[SPEAKER_09]: the different varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just CBD and THC or even CBC or
CBN or the other cannabinoids that we test
[SPEAKER_09]: for, but isn't there something like 100
and some cannabinoids been identified in
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis and then a whole bunch of other
terpenes, and we know that the mix of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids and terpenes has really
profound effects in how it plays out for
[SPEAKER_09]: people on the adult use or recreational
side, if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you start, we're looking at it in
the medical realm, it really becomes
[SPEAKER_09]: important what specific plant is going to
be of benefit to different people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the dosing thing, again,
I say to the people that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: help is you have to sort it out for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: You find that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your body will tell you when you're
getting benefit and you're still
[SPEAKER_09]: comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the value of cannabis and
it's such a limitation of people because
[SPEAKER_03]: we're very much like, oh, well,
I think this is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is what's best for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think cannabis is a quiver and
that it's all about having all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction processes and doing
monomolecular medicines with and without
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes added and doing full plant
profiles and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a plant that you don't have
to go to just once to hone in and dial in
[SPEAKER_03]: to what works for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go through the quiver and shoot
each arrow to find that spot that works
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as humans, it's like, well,
if something's great for one person,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't necessarily mean that's how
it's going to be great for the next
[SPEAKER_03]: person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people who have these intense
epileptic diseases and whatnot have found
[SPEAKER_03]: very much that how it's a very specific
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how Haley's Comet got named here in
BC based on Haley Rose and her form of
[SPEAKER_03]: epilepsy and her specific brain and what
works specifically well for her.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not to say that that plant's not
going to work for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, the real value of cannabis is
the quiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a plant that brings so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just imagine not only medicinal,
recreational and preventative aspects from
[SPEAKER_03]: the resin gland, but also essential amino
acid rich seeds that literally contain all
[SPEAKER_03]: of the essential amino acids that our body
needs, but can't produce, including the
[SPEAKER_03]: three required for children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 50 to 100,000 commercial products
through the cellulose and the fiber and
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty incredible when you really
break this plant down, not only as a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, but its ability to do all of
these other things, produce plastics and
[SPEAKER_03]: metals and produce incredibly healthy seed
oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mind blowing, really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's almost like every human has
their own DNA and so doesn't keep
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just have to find that right
cannabis plant for our DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so vast out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we say all the time, Colton has his
own product, but that doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_07]: that product is going to help your Crohn's
disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps his.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't mean that it's going to
help yours and that you're going to need
[SPEAKER_07]: the exact same dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not Humira or not Tylenol where
you can just go to the store and get it
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's going to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've noticed that throughout the
years, helping people with Crohn's
[SPEAKER_07]: disease, that it isn't a one size fits
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a good thing because we don't
have a one size fits all system to process
[SPEAKER_10]: those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we feel like as how medicine has been
normalized, that we go to the doctor and
[SPEAKER_07]: he hands us these pills and he says,
this is going to take care of your
[SPEAKER_07]: illness.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that we have that instant
gratification most of the time and that
[SPEAKER_07]: this is supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it doesn't work right off the bat,
you have to give it time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we go back to the doctor and say,
hey, this doesn't work or that didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just because you're using
cannabis doesn't mean that you have the
[SPEAKER_07]: right strain and that you have the right
amount of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that strain or turbines,
you may have to find a different one,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you will find something somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone likes to use that argument that,
oh, well, Bob Marley smoked weed all the
[SPEAKER_10]: time, but he died of cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's because just because he was
smoking weed doesn't mean that he was
[SPEAKER_10]: smoking the right kind of weed that he
needed for his illness.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I'm pretty sure he also
smoked a lot of cigarettes in his time,
[SPEAKER_10]: too.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, everyone has their own
different levels that they need for their
[SPEAKER_10]: own different illnesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because for each person, you know,
for every cannabinoid, it's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: affect not only the person differently,
but the disease as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually found that Crohn's cells have
CB2 receptors attached to them,
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're just sticking out like a
switch.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're waiting for THC to pass by to
flip that switch.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then THC will flip that switch and the
inflammation will go away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the CBD will help heal the damage
that the Crohn's disease had done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have I mean, we have everybody
says, oh, this is the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tip of the iceberg is not even close
to what we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more like the tip of Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just it's so crazy how much
more science and how much more research
[SPEAKER_07]: and development we really need to do on
this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to make it accessible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in my opinion, we're at the
point where we know it's safe enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you know what, the science
is important, but basically open the
[SPEAKER_03]: floodgates, let this accessible and the
science can catch up and maybe not have to
[SPEAKER_03]: torture small rodents and animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually even just look at the
people who are currently using it,
[SPEAKER_05]: because there are so many animal testing
thing just for a second, just so you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: all know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so it's unfortunate, but the way
that they determine the safety of a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the things that are in the human diet and
the things that humans are exposed to in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of environmental hazards is
unfortunately using animal testing models.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not always accurate, but typically
they're an indicator on how things are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to behave in humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're talking, Mark,
before about that one test where they're
[SPEAKER_05]: environmentally insulting by inhalation
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a very, very torturous test
that they send animals through to make
[SPEAKER_05]: sure that the compounds that are in the
products and the fragrances and the
[SPEAKER_05]: toothpaste and the ice creams that humans
buy and use are safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they do is they try to establish
where the level of effect or observed
[SPEAKER_05]: effects are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they try to establish where that
level is by basically overdosing the
[SPEAKER_05]: animals until they don't die anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, okay, at that point,
that's sort of like the lethality thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do we not see narcosis in the
animals?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do we not see the animals be
lethargic?
[SPEAKER_05]: In the case you were talking about,
Mark, it's what's called a genealogy study
[SPEAKER_05]: where basically they have the
environmental insult happen to a mother
[SPEAKER_05]: that then gives offspring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they look for any kind of
abnormalities that could be passed on to
[SPEAKER_05]: the offspring in those animals that's due
to the treatment that they were exposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: as mothers or as breeding adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point is, is that there's a lot of
this sort of animal testing that goes on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone on for ages and it's how they've
established toxic levels of a variety of
[SPEAKER_05]: different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some cases, they've done that
testing directly on humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is like testing where this is
where we see an effect in humans at this
[SPEAKER_05]: dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, butane, I think 5,000 ppm is
typically what the upper limit is of
[SPEAKER_05]: butane contamination in cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some states have it even lower than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason why it's set at 5,000 ppm,
it's not like a bolt from lightning came
[SPEAKER_05]: down from heaven.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where they've observed what's
called the acute no effect level.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people can be exposed at that level and
not acutely be affected by it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't fall over and die.
[SPEAKER_05]: At higher levels, yeah, in laboratory
animals and in this case, humans,
[SPEAKER_05]: they actually have shown that,
yeah, these things can actually cause some
[SPEAKER_05]: type of effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it is unfortunate, but in the
society we live in, everything from your
[SPEAKER_05]: air fresheners to things that are used in
laundry detergents, things that are used
[SPEAKER_05]: in all kinds of household products have to
be tested to determine their safety and to
[SPEAKER_05]: determine how they impact human safety and
environmental impact as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of that, unfortunately,
was done with animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They now actually have testing where you
don't have to do it in animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can actually do it in the computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's based on animal testing and all this
data bank mining that they can do based on
[SPEAKER_05]: the level of data that exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's face it, if you develop
something new, sometimes you have to do
[SPEAKER_05]: some level of testing for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give it to humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing that surprised me was when
I spoke to some of the scientists who did
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these experiments, I was like,
well, why do you have to give the rats so
[SPEAKER_03]: much?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the guy said some big scientific
words.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was basically, well, the rats are so
and so, which was basically him saying
[SPEAKER_03]: that the rats require like 10 times more
to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get high the same way humans
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, well, we don't really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just guessed it because we don't see
any effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really know if they are high.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can give them quite a bit and they just
there's no effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to give them a lot to see any
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's completely an insane way to gather
data, at least for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know that there's mice that are
specifically bred for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they created.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did create mice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also spoke about that, which was all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know it's kind of creepy and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, we we now understand things at
a molecular level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And biology is just a manifestation of
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it's real.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an interesting thing again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we look at like Colton and so
many other people who have the situation
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's really, as Dr. Russo would say,
an endocannabinoid deficiency where to go
[SPEAKER_05]: back to the pathology, which I think is
beautiful, by the way, especially when you
[SPEAKER_05]: consider pot and holes, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so the pot hole analogy would say
that, again, there is a dance that's
[SPEAKER_05]: played in between molecules that are
binding to these receptors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more we understand about the
molecular nature of that interactions and
[SPEAKER_05]: what's responsible for those interactions
in these diseases and how those
[SPEAKER_05]: interactions underpin these diseases will
really have a better grasp on how it all
[SPEAKER_05]: works and how it can be parlayed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Into cannabinoid based therapy from the
plant we all know and love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed, I want to jump in and say that I
think chemistry is an attempt to
[SPEAKER_09]: understand biology.
[SPEAKER_09]: And put a name on it, not that it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like I said, I love the science that
comes with this work, but the plant is so
[SPEAKER_09]: complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mother Nature's chemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, OK, Mother Nature had
this chemistry set.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all in water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you think about it, the
fascination of biochemical synthesis and
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the metabolites that are isolated
from sponges and whatnot and snake venoms,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are very, very complex
molecules that it would take a synthetic
[SPEAKER_05]: chemist like me years to make and
construct from different building blocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mother Nature can do it like she's
farting out, you know, bacteria and yeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's now actually technology to make
cannabinoids in yeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just like your brewing beer,
you can make cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just the beginning of the
merger of modern methods and biotechnology
[SPEAKER_05]: with what it can do for cannabinoid
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm absolutely convinced when CBD
production happens in big food and starts
[SPEAKER_05]: being fortified into all different kinds
of food, that CBD will not come from
[SPEAKER_05]: plants in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will certainly come from engineered
yeast to make cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw those guys speak as well,
the ones that are producing synthetically
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids in a lab right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was... Which group, Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple doing it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can't off the top of my head
remember, but I did take a picture of one
[SPEAKER_03]: of his slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they from California or Florida?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which group?
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida sounds actually... Yeah,
so Florida's probably the tea wood group,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that ring a bell?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were so many different groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a couple of different
groups that are doing this now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really exciting technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just, you know, some people... Mark,
I think the challenge is that if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: genetically engineering yeast to produce a
specific cannabinoid, how do you know that
[SPEAKER_09]: the specific cannabinoid you get is what's
needed for the various conditions you're
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to treat?
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think the mother plant,
the mother plant, cannabis, is such an
[SPEAKER_09]: incredibly complex organism, if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding, it's like 80 to 100
million years that plant has been on this
[SPEAKER_09]: planet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And human beings have only been here,
what, a couple of hundred thousand years?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can try and reproduce what she can
do for us, but I don't think we always are
[SPEAKER_09]: going to hit the nail right on the head.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's only one or two
things being provided by that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like if you do an alcohol
extraction, you're probably extracting a
[SPEAKER_05]: fair amount of water soluble material that
you wouldn't be extracting if you were,
[SPEAKER_05]: say, doing like a butane, or even if
you're doing a natural infusion,
[SPEAKER_05]: like an olive oil infusion or some
vegetable oil or a seed oil infusion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, these are all, I guess,
what Marcus would call different little
[SPEAKER_05]: quivers or arrows in the quivers,
to use the metaphor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what it creates is,
again, different types of extracts in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of their phytochemical makeup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think what I was trying to get
out of talking with Horace was trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand, I know it's a very complex
medical condition that silos suffers from.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that particular conditions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, we know with the cannabinoids,
we know cannabinoids are good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like you take the cannabinoids
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's all the rest of the stuff that
really makes that formulation work for
[SPEAKER_05]: that particular medical condition?
[SPEAKER_05]: And to show like with Colton's case,
how you can actually measure this into a
[SPEAKER_05]: daily regimen of, let's call it nutrition,
because you nutritionally fortify his diet
[SPEAKER_05]: with these cannabinoids that his medical
condition doesn't render his body able to
[SPEAKER_05]: make on their own to fill all the potholes
that he needs because he needs more pot to
[SPEAKER_05]: fill the holes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, I will not use that analogy
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys all know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so the point is that your body's
level of cannabinoids is now being
[SPEAKER_05]: enhanced or fortified by something
nutritional that's, by the way,
[SPEAKER_05]: in his diet, he's taking it in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not vaping it or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, yeah, nutrition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to use the pothole analogy one more
time, you know, everyone has their road
[SPEAKER_10]: and they need their potholes filled.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you also, I don't know if this will
make sense, but you also have to make sure
[SPEAKER_10]: that you're using the right cement to fill
those potholes because, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of people need certain cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other cannabinoids that they're
better off staying away from.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for example, a couple, you know,
I'd say about a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_10]: we started experimenting with THCV and we
found that it was an appetite suppressant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's great for somebody with
diabetes or someone who just wants to lose
[SPEAKER_10]: weight, but it is detrimental to someone
with a wasting disorder.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to really think about,
you know, what cannabinoids are good for
[SPEAKER_10]: you and which ones really aren't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be great if we just had a
blood test that we could just pull out
[SPEAKER_07]: your blood and say, okay, these are where
you're deficient in cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_07]: in terpenes, and then just say,
okay, this is the plant that you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bam, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That technology exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could probably do a cannabinoid,
endocannabinoid profiling on individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: That technology exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, maybe it's being developed and
maybe again, the way that they'll look at
[SPEAKER_05]: things in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used this metaphor loosely the other
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you know, the body's,
the endocannabinoid system is the body's
[SPEAKER_05]: own pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you keep that cannabinoid,
endocannabinoid system nurtured,
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly through diet, but I think also
there's a lot that has to do with your
[SPEAKER_05]: genes and like your healthiness,
but also maintaining a good diet because
[SPEAKER_05]: what you, you are what you eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our friend Todd used to tell us
that, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: what you take into your body is a
manifestation of what your body has to use
[SPEAKER_05]: to defy itself against this, you know,
onslaught of environmental toxins that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're all exposed to every day in this
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a good thing to be able to keep
that system fortified and nurtured and to
[SPEAKER_05]: know that you can do it every day and not
be completely debilitated where you're
[SPEAKER_05]: knocked out or zonked out on a couch like
you would be if you're on an opiate or a
[SPEAKER_05]: handful of other medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so much safer and better for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a long way off from that,
but boy, would that be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, CBD and these other cannabinoids
work on so many different receptor points
[SPEAKER_01]: and their pharmacological effects are so
very, you know, that it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what they call a dirty drug,
you know, because it doesn't stick to one
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have this large impact of
cannabinoids, just why we see this large
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I know I got cut off
earlier and, and just, I don't want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: over it again in case it was all covered,
but the reality is, is we just,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have compounds now that can interact
with receptor sites that we haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: access to before on this level and we can
interact with them relatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's being conservative,
extremely safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, because a consequence,
an issue that happens doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: dictate causality, you know, we have to
experiment and, you know, fix your road
[SPEAKER_01]: because so many different things can be
causing the same sort of symptoms that we
[SPEAKER_01]: see express externally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, back to where we talked
about with kids, you know, this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: we feel comfortable doing this because of
the documented history of safety that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see people with, with real
critical illness, and this is where the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with kids gets really
conflated is there's a big difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between neurotypical, healthy kids should
be getting ready for college and they
[SPEAKER_01]: start sitting around taking bong rips all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That too isn't cannabis's fault,
but it's just, you know, maybe not what's
[SPEAKER_01]: most, what's best in their life at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And treating real critical illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have people with these
critical illnesses, we, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's even harder to demonstrate some sort
of negative impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, because of the safety,
because of the efficacy, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when, when we're able to go through
different cannabinoid profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: measure, judge, and track how your body
responds, there is a lot of potential if
[SPEAKER_01]: you treat proactively with cannabis,
methodically by really paying attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're treating, there is a lot of
potential for benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really great that the cannabis
community and these, all these new people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are not in the cannabis community are
coming together to kind of teach this
[SPEAKER_01]: message because it really is about public
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we get asked all the time,
you know, how did these kids smoke all
[SPEAKER_01]: that pot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just say, a lot of people don't even
understand that cannabis is more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling joints these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we're able to bring
these people in and families like Colton's
[SPEAKER_01]: family and people like Mark and this shows
like this that can provide education,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone who listens and then takes that
information out into the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really see changes inside communities
that are going to lead to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching its greatest potential for social
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I always felt that we're,
we've just barely begun to grasp how much
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit in our community and our society
that cannabis can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting to get our handle on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is great, just like was said
before, is that when, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of segregate yourself,
you know, for political views,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only watch CNN, you can only watch
Fox News.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is, is that illness and
disease is non-discriminatory and it hits
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody from every demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it hits your family, it is the
slap in the face that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the human brain needs to snap out of their
paradigm and ideology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it hits your family, then it's
your loved one or yourself whose life is
[SPEAKER_01]: on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that, all that programming and
brainwashing from being raised under
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda about cannabis flies out the
window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's why one of the
missions with the Colladrius Network and
[SPEAKER_01]: why we work for free and don't charge any
of our families is that we feel that when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when people come in from our sheriff's
department or from our military
[SPEAKER_01]: backgrounds, from different church groups,
demographics that tend to have some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most stigma against cannabis, and we can
not only be there to help them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but have them see the benefit in their
kids' lives without bleeding them dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it changes communities and it changes
hearts and minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that one person's child is saved,
in that church group, the whole church
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the, and these are both true
stories, and when the, when the sheriff
[SPEAKER_01]: comes, the person who works for the
sheriff's department comes, top secret and
[SPEAKER_01]: scared because they feel like they're
making a drug deal just to save their kids
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're worried about their coworkers
finding out, and it's able to help and
[SPEAKER_01]: save the life of that child, that trickles
into that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why we're never going back to
where we were with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, organizations like Sam and others
who are trying to keep the good old days
[SPEAKER_01]: of prohibition just really don't grasp the
impact that that sort of benefit has on
[SPEAKER_01]: communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing it slowly trickle across
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really it comes down to just education
and, and where we started the elimination
[SPEAKER_01]: of stigmas, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in Washington, we've had legalization
for coming up on six years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it's really done is brought about
real normalization, you know, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: neighbors aren't so afraid of cannabis
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been teaching six semesters at
Clark college co-instructing a course
[SPEAKER_04]: there, cannabis and your health.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really opened it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the local community college is up to
having us in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on seven semesters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do bringing your plants to fruition,
you know, for highest yields and best,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, best quality cannabis in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the community is really open.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a lot of sick patients in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, like everybody's saying,
we start low and slow with everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tell them, we have a lot of Parkinson's
patients coming in and people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: just interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And an offshoot of that is we started,
there's a, a patients, a medical group
[SPEAKER_04]: that takes care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they meet at my friend Jeremy's house,
like once a month, and they share strains
[SPEAKER_04]: and they share ideas and they,
they, you know, they're promoting the plan
[SPEAKER_04]: in a real positive way up here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we've seen up here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as like the federal research goes,
we've been seeing them kick the research
[SPEAKER_04]: can down the road since the seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the eighties again,
they kicked the research can down the road
[SPEAKER_04]: because I was on Como news here in
Seattle, like doing a town hall meeting a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the main thing from the state was
they're saying, it's such a complicated
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so complicated, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as far as federal research goes,
we definitely have to de-schedule,
[SPEAKER_04]: not reschedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been saying this for years because
that just pulls everybody out of the game
[SPEAKER_04]: and it only leaves the pharmaceutical
companies in charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's our biggest,
our biggest competition in here with legal
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen all the small medical mom and
pops pretty much are gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the legal system, they're doing
acquisitions and mergers and it's big,
[SPEAKER_04]: huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys are seeing it in California
down there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: These mega farms popping up all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really feel sorry for all the people in
Humboldt that really brought us the show
[SPEAKER_04]: to be wiped out of the, out of
participating in the new system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have something to say,
Wendy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to say that I just
wanted to give everybody a story about,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think Forrest has knocked it out of
the park because it's changing in the
[SPEAKER_07]: communities.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we moved to Colorado, we didn't tell
anybody that we were going.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were terrified.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we went, well, when Colton
and Tommy moved, they came back to get us
[SPEAKER_07]: about six months later and we were packing
our bags to put into the U-Haul to take
[SPEAKER_07]: everything back to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And our neighbor who is a very,
very religious Pentecostal, hair in a bun,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, blue jean skirt type
Pentecostal, goes to church all the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: just the salt of the earth person,
love her to death.
[SPEAKER_07]: She walked across the road to talk to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my husband was terrified.
[SPEAKER_07]: He thought that he was going to get a
reaming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: She expressed how much gratitude she had
for sharing our story, for doing what we
[SPEAKER_07]: did.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is telling all of her church friends
about us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It changed our community.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just went to the local bar the other
night to watch one of our friends play
[SPEAKER_07]: music.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the police chiefs, our police
deputies came up to me and said,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you're home.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are changing things, all of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just takes stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just takes keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes everybody not being afraid to
wear a cannabis shirt in Walmart and get
[SPEAKER_07]: those looks and ask and have those
questions asked of you and tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's the main thing is getting
the truth out is going to help our cause
[SPEAKER_07]: the most.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as the mentality of cannabis has
changed, it doesn't matter how long they
[SPEAKER_10]: try and prohibit or spread propaganda
about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis will become legal as soon as,
you know, everyone agrees that it's the
[SPEAKER_10]: best thing to do for not only our people,
but for our country and our in the world
[SPEAKER_10]: as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it doesn't, we'll all just turn in
hippies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can always move up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some federal laws going on up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We welcome you with open arms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think America is going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's it's it's the only thing
holding it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worldwide, all these other countries doing
it is one thing, but it's America,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: America is the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the country that exports its culture
through media and movies and music in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way that no other country does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why everyone in every other
country, they love that culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love that music and those movies and
those shows and all of these different
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's how the propaganda
was able to be pushed so far and so wide
[SPEAKER_03]: news stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, derogatory jokes and
comedy movies and, you know, like
[SPEAKER_03]: different things that were done in these
powerful mediums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my God, a newspaper story just it
just changes the minds of tens of
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like an amazing story like like
Colton's or like Silas and the Caladrius
[SPEAKER_03]: Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just so it's just like,
why aren't we touching like one hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand people a day?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very powerful message.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just because we're not
getting to the mainstream media.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we need to have, you know,
we've been on the dot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there's been people that
have been on the Doctors and the Doctor Oz
[SPEAKER_07]: show.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't think that we're getting
to the mainstream media like we should.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we really need to be pushing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can call our Facebook messages from
people all over the world every single
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook has been a godsend to our family.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in our message.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's as far as it's gone is
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we really need to get out there
and tell and show people, look,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's he's 35 nanograms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not high.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's taking a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and we need to get those stories out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, why is why is four different
types or five different types of cancer a
[SPEAKER_03]: side effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But getting high isn't like it's the worst
thing on the planet to to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: euphoria, because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like euphoria is kind of fun, especially
for people who have come along during a
[SPEAKER_03]: time where they haven't been as ingrained
in the fear and the propaganda,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's really one of the worst
things about getting a little too high on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is the propaganda that you carry
with you subconsciously about this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates this paranoid feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, where do you think that paranoia
comes from?
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes from the police kicking your door
down, taking your kids away, throwing you
[SPEAKER_03]: in jail and destroying your life.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty heavy vibe to be really
funny when he's high.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten him high before and he is
hilarious and he feels good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, isn't the point of taking all
these medications is to feel good and be
[SPEAKER_10]: happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw Michaela on the documentary
Stoned Kids, which I think Vice has since
[SPEAKER_03]: changed the name of that documentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was called Stoned Kids and
Michaela, Brandon's young daughter,
[SPEAKER_03]: who was eight or nine years old and
developed this harsh leukemia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were asking her like she was on high
doses of THC and they were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, what's that like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was just so sweet and so honest in
her answers that it wasn't the nightmare
[SPEAKER_03]: that everyone is portraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was it was really quite
innocent and it was clearly not a negative
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we went through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about it's all about all of the
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've been seeing it all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can trace it back, there's
really no money in cannabis if everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: can take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and and, you know,
we have all these, you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all these wonderful products that
come from cannabis and it does this
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have this endocannabinoid system and it
feeds us and it keeps everybody healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how is that how is that good for
industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right now we have in in the
United States in general, we're more
[SPEAKER_04]: reactive than preventative in micro toxins
and fecal matter in our food.
[SPEAKER_04]: You notice that when they have a recall,
it's only it's when a thousand people have
[SPEAKER_04]: been affected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all they do is go after that one
farm, shame that one farmer, that one
[SPEAKER_04]: processing facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's gone off the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't we don't really take a proactive
matter like they do in Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: South Korea and Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where we got to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to start, you know, look at America
demanding that, you know, higher quality
[SPEAKER_04]: of everything, because we're seeing the
degradation and the downgrading of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're way up here in the north.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have mold issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine, Ed from Analytical 360
told me there used to be a 30 percent
[SPEAKER_04]: failure rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the lobbyists for the farmers and
producer processors went and lobbied the
[SPEAKER_04]: state.
[SPEAKER_04]: They dropped the levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's no no failures for mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's moldy weed going out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we want to put our best foot
forward, we've been fighting for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: for so long and it's so passionate to so
many of us that we really have to demand
[SPEAKER_04]: that we put our best foot forward and not
let happen to our regular food supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could possibly happen to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and that's through support,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I I often say you've put a really
good connection there right at the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom, which, you know, I'm in this cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see people constantly like we need the
best.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the cleanest we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, if you look at many
other aspects of their life, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: following those rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're eating some of the worst quality
food that you can eat there and you just
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking cigarettes, drinking Coca-Cola,
Pepsi's and then they're claiming their
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hard time with that model,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's the scary thing about
cannabis is when you see that every other
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, every other aspect, agriculture,
all of it has just been so utterly
[SPEAKER_03]: destroyed that it is kind of worrisome in
the sense that that that could potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's all based in profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the profit makers are the most
important people in our in our oligarchic
[SPEAKER_04]: country that we live in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's really sad that they use us
as pawns because what happens when we eat
[SPEAKER_04]: bad food for all these years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we end up getting cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we feed off another system,
the medical system and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they're fighting so hard
and so tooth and nail with, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping cannabis illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: True that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a point for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't do things because they're
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love I love my country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but, you know, it's been set up in a
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it needs to be really reviewed
and assessed that, you know, things get
[SPEAKER_01]: done because politicians are lobbied.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need support to be put in office.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who have those millions of
dollars to lobby and get that support are
[SPEAKER_01]: our business, you know, and it's very
difficult to get something done that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have a profit motive or a business
model behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes unfortunately, it typically takes
serious death and serious attention and
[SPEAKER_01]: people have to suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the when when there's a
political price paid for it, then
[SPEAKER_01]: something is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, that's what I've tried to do
with with our work with Silas and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cladrius kids and stuff that Colton's
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have the hashtag make them
watch right for a reason, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to see the suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have to start sharing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stigma around cannabis has really
prevented a lot of sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are still afraid to share that
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I think that if if
politicians and people are going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: ideologies that have real life
consequences to children and adults and
[SPEAKER_01]: people suffering from terminal illness and
they shouldn't be spared the consequences
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that this is why the social.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to have the problem that some
of the legislation is changing,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the national things are happening,
the progress we've seen in in California
[SPEAKER_01]: and other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is because of some of that social
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that it needs to
not slow down now, because the reality is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is we're I'm confident that we're going to
get there, but that shouldn't make us
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our goal is to get there with as
many people still alive when we get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this whole like, yeah, it's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just settle down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that a lot from politicians,
local and national.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that that time, that sense of time,
that's a privilege and it's a privilege
[SPEAKER_01]: that not everybody shares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, unless you have illness,
you don't understand that time is a
[SPEAKER_01]: privilege.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of just live in our in our human
paradigm that says we're going to live
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at death every day,
you realize that, you know, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it a few years isn't always an
acceptable answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want everybody to make it to that day
where they have these treatment options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it'd be great if we just saw
the laws changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but money rules supreme and ideology
is a close second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're we're we're steeped heavily in both
here in the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take the community and
the public to really hold politicians feet
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take them having to see the
children who are dying, the adults who are
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just here that AIDS wasting
syndrome is being caused because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bans and the compassion programs in
California that used to treat them for
[SPEAKER_01]: years are no longer allowed to function
under our quote unquote legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to see what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have that experience that we
have because that experience changes
[SPEAKER_01]: people's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different hearing kids have seizures
and this helps them when the kids have the
[SPEAKER_01]: seizure in the politician's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to change their tune real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I would just put a call out to
everybody who this is important to to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that, you know, it takes work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more of us who are sending emails,
the more of us who are posting our
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences, even when it's embarrassing
and hard, the more of it has a real
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we keep it up, we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's why we go to Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we knock on doors in our
politicians offices, even if they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: our we're not the constituent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we we want to talk to every single
person that we can possibly talk to.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got back from Oklahoma the other
yesterday and they just legalized a
[SPEAKER_07]: referendum.
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have a ways to go to make it
make it an amendment.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, is that we we have
you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We I put Colton in front of these people
and say, how can you deny him?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've shown people, you know,
pictures of my colon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if you think that that's
not embarrassing, but it does.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you show people pictures of your
colon, you're not embarrassed or scared of
[SPEAKER_10]: anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of kids, a lot of kids and
a lot of patients, you know, they need
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis and they're suffering without it,
regardless of, you know, whether the laws
[SPEAKER_10]: say that they should be allowed to or not.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I believe 100 percent that we
need research and we need, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: clinical research for, you know,
not only the negative sides of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: but also the positive sides, because most
research has been, you know, aimed towards
[SPEAKER_10]: the negative most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been plenty of research on the
negatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was something to be found there,
they've had 60 years to try to hash it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's our turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our turn now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take your night of cash and head
on over to the side and wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now our turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to look for the positives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one of the we we fought for,
Bill, our fought for some research in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado for an IBD research study
observational.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Colton was the first person to sign up
for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were really excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the questions that he was asked
on this on this research survey was,
[SPEAKER_10]: do you still use or sell your opioids?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how is that efficacy?
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that have anything to do with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: They were they were basically just asking
me, you know, they were asking me if I was
[SPEAKER_07]: a drug dealer because he's a cannabis
user.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get out of that situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really need to have surveys and
observational studies that are looking at
[SPEAKER_07]: efficacy and not looking at the drug abuse
situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need politicians that that are
going to be open minded.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have families.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to organize a group of
families that are bringing their kids and
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, look at them in the face and tell
them no, because it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not just epilepsy kids,
but Crohn's kids and cancer kids and kids
[SPEAKER_07]: with autism.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and just say, look,
look at these kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cannabis is working for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you going to say that they can't
use it?
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2015, I got to educate seven agents
from the CDC and NIOSH on production and
[SPEAKER_04]: processing of cannabis on my farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did the first workplace health and
safety evaluation in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The study has been published.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the federal government to use the
word cannabis instead of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: They called my farm an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said straight up said I grow organic
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we got to do, they came twice to
my farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came for two days in August,
where we originally had set up a tour
[SPEAKER_04]: between Washington and Oregon and all
these different manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_04]: processors, equipment, machine
manufacturers, all this stuff to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: keep them updated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I first got on the phone with
10 agents from the CDC, they said,
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked them, well, where are you getting
your information?
[SPEAKER_04]: They said YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no offense to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I said, well, isn't that, you know,
wouldn't you like to come out for a tour?
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that kind of an insult to our
industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a lot of mixed information
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to introduce you to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, yes, they were interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had, I turned in the itinerary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they said, no, we can't have our
agents going across state lines and into
[SPEAKER_04]: operations that may be illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we can do is make your farm a
secure location where federal agents can
[SPEAKER_04]: learn, touch, and handle cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you OK with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, well, you're going to have to
be vetted by the federal government to
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do background checks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said, please, because we've always
played by the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not a mailer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know bullshit across the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not my style.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not normalizing cannabis and
normalizing the plant for the better good
[SPEAKER_04]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Tom?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which agency was this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say the CDC?
[SPEAKER_04]: The CDC, Center Disease Control,
and NIOSH especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So under the CDC, there's OSHA and NIOSH.
[SPEAKER_04]: OSHA is the enforcement side for workplace
health and safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And NIOSH is the scientist side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they do all the research and write all
these HHEs, health hazard evaluation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they thought it was important enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, originally it came because the
Denver Police Union had filed a complaint
[SPEAKER_04]: that their officers were going into these
illegal indoor groves and being
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminated by mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was so important to them that
they brought in, when they came to my
[SPEAKER_04]: farm, they brought in Kirtan, who had
spent the last two years in Africa looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at dead Ebola victims.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they came to my farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got to educate them for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought in the top people in the
industry, JD from Skunk Farm Research,
[SPEAKER_04]: told them all about hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we brought in Dana from Goat Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we brought in a lot of really qualified
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a farm to table.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grow old school.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grow organic vegetables and organic
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a lifestyle for us than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we brought them in and had them
here for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went and had pizza and beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, is I had one shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were there on my dime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they came to the farm,
when we started at 9 o'clock in the
[SPEAKER_04]: morning, we smoked two joints about 10
feet away from them, did a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we all went over there and said,
now we're going to educate you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we smoked throughout the two days
periodically like we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we rolled joints in front of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole nine yards, no, they didn't
partake.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hopefully we did some good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sure the current
administration is going, do we have
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody who's had any work with any of
these people?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think from what they told me,
we're the first people to ever work with
[SPEAKER_04]: any federal agency when it had to do for
cannabis at all in any context.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had them there for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hugged them when they got there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hugged them when they left.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just really normal people.
[SPEAKER_04]: A group of the same people came back in
October for harvest, because that's what
[SPEAKER_04]: they were there for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They documented our harvesting,
the bucking, the big leafing, all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the report.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to my website,
farmertomorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download the report.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a lot of good work for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a good step forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a privilege and honor for me to
stand up for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope it takes us in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just had the most tastiest rip
while you were telling your awesome story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even believe how tasty that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left it in the vapix hill for a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot I was getting into listening to
what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great work, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good on you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normalization of cannabis use has been a
big part of, well, even Hash Church for
[SPEAKER_03]: that matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons why I always,
I don't smoke on purpose, but I smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: because I would be smoking anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, I think that it's been an
interesting topic to be able to have these
[SPEAKER_03]: great conversations while certain people
are still enjoying cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, while we're talking about these
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of hopped in my regular day
mode.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I got on, started rolling
joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm here at my summer office at
the farm and it's great to be on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a circus yurt you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife picked it up several years ago and
it's been a mainstay here on our farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we live down in Williams,
Oregon, we pretty much lived underneath
[SPEAKER_04]: this thing for a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I always like when people come in on
their farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never will forget Eric from when he was
with Forever Flowering Greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_03]: showing up in the empty greenhouse to do
his Hash Church episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Karma Cup does help with
normalization in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could have Sarah talk a little
bit about what she's been doing in Toronto
[SPEAKER_03]: for the last several years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this is quite a deep and intense
discussion you guys are having this
[SPEAKER_08]: morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on Pacific time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally I'd be joining you when I'm in
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd be, so now I'm like, wow,
this is quite a discussion for 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in, are you in BC?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually in California right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So wagon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we actually had all sorts of crazy
stuff while this was going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: A cat fell off a balcony.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sitting outside on a balcony.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a cat fell off the balcony.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't realize he's off the balcony.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's it was a whole drama.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like a whole scene going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, quite the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, feel, um, you know, just having
fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day is a good day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just now it's it's my fifth year doing the
event.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once you get to five years,
um, there's challenges, um, always new
[SPEAKER_08]: challenges, but you start to feel a level
of confidence in what you've created.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm super happy to, um, to be to be
doing it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, same thing as always festival
competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I've got all sorts of categories and
lots of good bud and hash and other
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis products coming in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, always my goal is to uh, improve the
level of, um, education and awareness of
[SPEAKER_08]: like what good stuff actually is,
what good products actually are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, to try and promote that amongst
the community, um, to raise palates,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's say, um, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I feel like it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not, I'm not a weed scientist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I can't contribute on that level.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately or fortunately, whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but this is my area that I can
contribute on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a critic and I've got a band of 200
critics that, um, judge with me,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, every year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, so let me just, uh, review the
categories real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if any of the viewers out there are
interested in possibly entering,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, we need it July 27th in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can send it by mail or you can meet
us in person, um, one day only.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I've got fuzz indicates to keep a
hybrid, uh, concentrates indicates to keep
[SPEAKER_08]: a high hybrid, um, solvent extracts,
solventless extracts, high terpene and
[SPEAKER_08]: cold extraction type stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Live resin, sauce, diamonds, all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Distill it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we do edibles, um, shelf stable only
please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, pre-rolls, um, CBD products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any kind of CBD product, we've got a
category for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, and topical.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need 200.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need it by July 27th.
[SPEAKER_08]: No labels.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a completely blind competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, um, I hate the hype machine and
allowing that to dominate like what should
[SPEAKER_08]: be, um, real people finding out what they
like about products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't want that the hype machine to
contaminate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been to the event, I don't
know, three or four years out of the five
[SPEAKER_03]: now, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know what, one of the things I
like about it, I'm not, I don't focus much
[SPEAKER_03]: on the competition part of it because I
never really have in any of the cups that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone to, but I like the group of
people that you bring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Toronto is in a very unique position in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very populated province and there's
just tons of cities all around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Toronto, uh, that people come in from
and quite a bit of young people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people in their twenties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so it's a really, for me,
it's a great time to be like, I see a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of super excited people and I'm kind of
surprised by the level of knowledge they
[SPEAKER_03]: already hold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a young age about the plant and
they're just, they're hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're showing up to, you know,
not just judge cannabis, but to like meet
[SPEAKER_03]: all these different people that they know
through social media that have either
[SPEAKER_03]: inspired them or, or.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what not the D four 20 Ks and
the, and the Johnny B's and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's just a really all around
great event in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just get a small booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never have business cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have flyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have a sign on my booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no, like no promotions whatsoever
of my company.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just me and usually some friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's just really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it really for the, for the meeting of
all these incredible young people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: To these events, uh, and just,
it's great to see Vancouver has nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we, we throw a cup every once in
a while, every six months to a year,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they just kind of Peter out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never had any real substance to
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from back in the day when Mark Emory
was throwing the Tokers bowls,
[SPEAKER_03]: those were incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think it's, it's definitely,
you know, somewhat, I'm not a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: proponent of like a high times cannabis
cup style, but I do love, and I've always,
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam and I have both said this about the
high times cannabis cup, even from back in
[SPEAKER_03]: the day, but it brought people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have met the majority of the
people I've met in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: had it not been for those early,
you know, 95, 96, 97, um, cups in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's good to see people like Sarah are
continuing it, you know, in places like
[SPEAKER_03]: Toronto, Canada, you know, there's the
Emerald Cup down in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these certain events that are
definitely incredible times to go in and
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to meet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we don't really still have a
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: To gather, you know, like, and just
legally smoke and enjoy our time together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that is an important form
of civil disobedience, the same way we're
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting for the rights to use this plant
as a medicine and the rights to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: even purchase it, uh, whether you believe
in recreation or not recreationally,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also to be able to gather and join,
uh, and enjoy cannabis and share that
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things, an important
factor that they've broken up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't kind of seemingly want to
have happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vapor lounges, you know, would there not
be so many more if they were licensed and
[SPEAKER_03]: legal?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's 60 to 70,000 medical users
in Canada, Canada alone, federally medical
[SPEAKER_03]: users.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think there'd be places where they
could go and enjoy their medicine legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, welcome D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how are you doing everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, I didn't even get to welcome you
last time you came in and right out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, uh, Forest was trying to come back
in.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to make some room.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was really enjoying a story.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's story on here just blows my
mind, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, uh, the viewers, thank you for all
your viewers and the support you guys have
[SPEAKER_13]: done.
[SPEAKER_13]: The show you've done, Mark here is just,
just can't speak enough of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the forest story with his,
with his son and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I got us, I had an experience with my
grandson last month.
[SPEAKER_13]: He ended up getting a cut right above his
eye and he had to get stitches and you
[SPEAKER_13]: know, just this stuff that he went through
in that little moment for me was frigging
[SPEAKER_13]: heart wrenching, heart breaking.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for you guys, the parents that go
through what you go through with your,
[SPEAKER_13]: your kids and children and everything with
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh shit, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just kills it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It touches my heart in such a huge way.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are the strongest warriors I've
ever, ever listened to.
[SPEAKER_13]: I get goosebumps right now talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: This bong rip is for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, bong rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody, you know, if I keep talking,
I'm going to start tearing up.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys' love is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well, well said, Darren,
in the sense of what some of these parents
[SPEAKER_03]: are going for, even, you know,
right now for us, uh, just mentioned that
[SPEAKER_03]: Silas has had a seizure and dropped a
glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got to step out for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, hopefully we're going to have them
back later and he's going to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about his annual fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a few people did donate money I
noticed today in the chat room and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that money will go to the Caladrius
network as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of the donations that come in today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, my son got a fever and ended up in
the hospital overnight one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was just so crushing to my wife
and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't, you just, as a parent,
you just have this, you're trying to fight
[SPEAKER_03]: these worst case scenario thoughts that
come up in your mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when things are getting that bad,
when you're actually watching your child
[SPEAKER_03]: waste away in front of you, in front of
your very eyes, the way Wendy had to,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is just so heavy that no doubt she
has a huge appreciation for the keepers of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, when it's done so much for her family
and for her son, it's, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is heart wrenching.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so powerful what you guys are doing
and showing the stuff Forest is doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you said, every plant is,
is, is, um, every strain, everything is
[SPEAKER_13]: specific to someone else's DNA and all
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, man, this plant has been suppressed
for, for the last, what, less than a
[SPEAKER_13]: hundred years or so, or, and, and for the
time before that, this was something that
[SPEAKER_13]: is absolutely, I get into the Egyptian
theories.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in the, it's in the tombs.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: This plant was made for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's a no brainer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, uh, let me share some like
information about hearing in Brazil,
[SPEAKER_11]: like five years ago, five years ago was so
hard to find information.
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now, like more information being
shared because most of the population
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't speak any English, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to have a translation of the
like really big like studies to then
[SPEAKER_11]: people trying to understand like the
benefits of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now in Brazil, they are allowing
some families to plant that to like start
[SPEAKER_11]: having use of CBD, THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: My experience, it was with cannabis
because I moved to Canada some years ago,
[SPEAKER_11]: like six years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, uh, one day one guy came to me
and say, Oh, you have a epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You shouldn't be drinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: You shouldn't be drinking coffee.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should be using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, really my relationship
because I grew up in Brazil and everything
[SPEAKER_11]: was like, no, no, it's like, no,
cannabis is not good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And all my doctors in Brazil, really good
doctors, the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are like, Oh, like all saying,
no, cannabis is going to get you worse.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't use it for almost my whole life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had like this mentality, bad mentality
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And because of the last years,
like more information being translated to
[SPEAKER_11]: Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_11]: So everything is changing really fast
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even like people like my family,
really conservative, like all like friends
[SPEAKER_11]: of my family, when they see the change,
they can, what, what they are going to
[SPEAKER_11]: say, you know, like it's like really like
you can see I was, and people say,
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you use cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could have like some problems with
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I say, man, you don't know like the
medicine that I take, like really like
[SPEAKER_11]: strong medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you read like all the like,
the information about you gets really
[SPEAKER_11]: scary.
[SPEAKER_11]: So people don't really like know what they
are talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: When they see the difference between like
using like those like really drugs that
[SPEAKER_11]: like really makes me makes you like don't
have any memory, like have problems with
[SPEAKER_11]: like cognition.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like they say about cannabis is
because they don't have any experience
[SPEAKER_11]: when you have experience with a really
patient, you change everything to say,
[SPEAKER_11]: no, like how possible this is illegal.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a medicine really powerful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the problems here is because we
have like in Brazil, we have those
[SPEAKER_11]: brickweeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys know like comes
from really bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to show you guys just for you to
have an idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most horrific thing I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really bad in life.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do medicine of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we don't know which strains it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have any information about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have like the whole population here
using cannabis without any information
[SPEAKER_11]: about terpenes profiles, which genetics,
but that's what we have here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really strict.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you plant here, you are like really
like drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go for 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like the problem is like baby mainly
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like having information about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have like, we are doing a really
great work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Marcus bubble man, because we
are creating content and translating in
[SPEAKER_11]: Portuguese to people know how to extract
better medicine with ganja talks
[SPEAKER_11]: university.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really important for the whole
Latin America to people understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that is, this is not a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like something totally different.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what's happening in Brazil right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we are changing Latin America.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going further with like informations
being shared.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see now, Joe, where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really know a lot of that about
your history and what was driving you to
[SPEAKER_03]: do this ganja talks university course with
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say like, you know,
I'll have to put you in touch with a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of the people on this panel, because
there's quite a few people that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: be doing online courses with and
translating into Portuguese, which that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what he's done with my series that's
coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: They create all these beautiful
transcribed cards with photos and images,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have it all transcribed into
Portuguese for Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible to me that Brazil has that
has brickweed because you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil could grow some killer,
killer cannabis with that tropical sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a matter of knowing the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you're growing, growing narrow leaf
drug cultivars that are going to flourish
[SPEAKER_03]: and do well in that very close to the
equator environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope to make it there one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep doing the good things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a seizure and dropped a glass and
all of a sudden we had to deal with that
[SPEAKER_01]: and go back to caregiver real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I would just say quickly,
I'd be happy to lend any assistance to
[SPEAKER_01]: your efforts down there in Brazil,
especially if you want to start focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: in on treating endocannabinoid
deficiencies and epilepsy and neurological
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, Crohn's and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of help here in this
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely be happy to lend any help we
can give.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of help right in this room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will reach you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure this is going to be really
important for Brazilian families that are
[SPEAKER_11]: struggling at the moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will get in touch with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of it is just giving people
the language.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're introducing new concepts,
like you said, and sometimes we can really
[SPEAKER_01]: help the learning curve by arming the
activists in your community with the
[SPEAKER_01]: language that they need, helping them not
have to start from scratch with their
[SPEAKER_01]: arguments so that when you do have
opportunities, you're making the most out
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we work with all
of our volunteers so that if we get a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to be in front of a lawmaker,
in front of officials, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: waste that chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have the education,
the background, the knowledge to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are showing them that we're not
just playing with cannabis, that we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the concepts well, we
understand the risks and harms,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to mitigate them and help educate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they feel like you can be a
supporter and give them the power that
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to speak eloquently about it,
you tend to get some more traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely anything we can do to help,
we're there for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess one of the people we haven't
heard too much from has been Eric from
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure Pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been nicely, calmly listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's very intrigued by the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this has been really enlightening to
me to hear your stories and with your
[SPEAKER_00]: children and everything that's going on,
especially Colton hearing your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we hear about a lot
on the news, but not necessarily something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know a lot of people personally in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a ton of input so far
because I work with Pure Pressure and we
[SPEAKER_00]: make solventless extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd be curious to get input from some
of the other people on the panel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed like Mark touched on this a
little bit earlier, but where some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these extraction methods fit into the
equation to really come up with the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of whole plant medicine because we work
with labs across the country and across
[SPEAKER_00]: the world that are doing all kinds of
things, not just making rosin or bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, but everything from hydrocarbon,
CO2, basically everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in a pretty good spot where we're
connected and we've got our ear to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground with these extraction labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to hear from everybody else
where you see extraction methods fitting
[SPEAKER_00]: into solving these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that are having these issues
and when you have isolates that are
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped away of the terpenes and some of
the other really important cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: if those aren't providing the medical
benefits, what future technology and what
[SPEAKER_00]: methods of extraction are going to provide
that entourage effect and really are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be helping people out considerably?
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with a lot of people that are big
into taking dabs and using it for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, but it's hard to do at home to
make a well-regulated dose medicine that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really something that people need to get
from a licensed extraction lab or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: from people that have the equipment to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to hear from other people on
the panel where you see that going and
[SPEAKER_00]: where you see extraction solving this
medicinal problem for people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would mention, just to start it off,
to go first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I think it's going to be that
quiver that every extraction process is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be required to be present and
accessible to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: From there, it's anyone's guesses with the
majority of people with the majority of
[SPEAKER_03]: different elements will choose as their
extraction process, but I know that it can
[SPEAKER_03]: be profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never forget when Cheryl,
Hayley, Rose's mom first used the bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: bags and she just said, wow, I can't
remember if it was a year or almost two
[SPEAKER_03]: years that Hayley didn't have a seizure
after she started using bubble hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: she would isolate and then I believe mix
back together or mix some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars, some of the head sizes back
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was giving her them in capsules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to that, she was using like an oil
and some flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, she was still having a
seizure here and there, even though it was
[SPEAKER_03]: a 90% decrease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like Forrest said,
if you keep looking, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it's not the cultivar,
but it's the way you extract the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: from the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in that particular case,
now this is my guess and I know if
[SPEAKER_03]: Chimera's listening, he might disagree as
he did a little bit in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've always felt that there's a
particular something different in the
[SPEAKER_03]: profile of the bulbous heads versus the
capitate stocks and the, and the Cecil
[SPEAKER_03]: stocked heads, the three different types
of trichomes, the tall capitate stocked,
[SPEAKER_03]: the medium Cecil stocked and the tiny
little, you know, little glandular
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome head that sits on a single stiped
cell on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's just right on the leaf
and it's very microscopic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the harder ones to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And generally, they're not the ones that
are extracted off in the process of bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You leave them behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the reasons when you make
an oil, whether it's rosin or a solvent
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction, that you're getting a much
higher percent return, sometimes upwards
[SPEAKER_03]: of 10% higher because there's all of these
bulbous heads that you're now accessing
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of simply mechanically separating
the heads that are easily breaking off of
[SPEAKER_03]: those long stocked bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for whatever reason, omitting those
bulbous heads in Haley's case was very
[SPEAKER_03]: profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure adding them in someone else's
case will be very profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's why no system is going to
put any other system out of business,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak, or out of being an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes for everything from the
people that want to do gas extractions,
[SPEAKER_03]: to CO2, to cryo ethanol, to rosin
pressing, to bubble hash making,
[SPEAKER_03]: to mechanical screen separation of dry
sifting, all of these different methods to
[SPEAKER_03]: me are going to stay valid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of gives you hope in this
whole cannabis industry of it not just
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming this bland sort of pharma model
of having single molecules available,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that the idea of craft farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's really all of these different
extraction processes, all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes to show you the value of every
cultivar, that it's not just going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: one cultivar that's going to be the answer
for everyone, but there's probably going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be maybe a thousand plus cultivars that
the world, the billions of people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world are going to want to have access to,
maybe tens of thousands for that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think solventless is going to be
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always chose the high road.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were the first ones to do strain
specific nug runs for all of our products
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the medical days, about four years
ago up here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the production being so high,
there's no reason why we can't produce the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really believe that the solventless,
it keeps the terpene profiles and really
[SPEAKER_04]: does the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we use here on the farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, basically on our farm,
our little medical farm that we have up
[SPEAKER_04]: here right now, what we don't smoke in
joints that year, the following year,
[SPEAKER_04]: we make extra bubble hash with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we love that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It oxidates a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit over that period of time,
but then it gives the more CBN effect and
[SPEAKER_04]: we use it for sleeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think solventless is definitely the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my humble opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's our goal is to get to
solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to kind of balance what we
have access to in time and volunteers and
[SPEAKER_01]: ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would be happy to test out any of
those solvents with subtraction methods
[SPEAKER_01]: and machines and report back to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where efficacy seems to continue to show
better percentages of benefit tends to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in how well you can maintain the integrity
of what the plant is producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the better we can do that,
I think the better options we'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as potential success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think even with cold ethanol,
you're washing out water soluble processes
[SPEAKER_01]: with other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have huge loss of terpenes and other
compounds in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't agree with that more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to a time where that's
a little, where we can get there as an
[SPEAKER_01]: organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we kind of started the car,
driving the car before it was finished
[SPEAKER_01]: being built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of work with what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's one of the things we try
to teach folks is that, yeah, there is
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal, but there's a lot of benefit that
you can do at home that is under ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be the ideal processes,
but there are distillers that you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: on your countertop that look like Mr.
Coffee machines that some are garbage and
[SPEAKER_01]: some are decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you have access to good
testing, analytical labs, you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: making some progress on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what is beautiful about
cannabis is that it is, despite everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: best effort, whether it be pharmaceutical
companies or other folks, it doesn't allow
[SPEAKER_01]: itself to be restrained and held down and
contained.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is here for us to integrate into our
communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is relatively easy to grow and produce
and utilize on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as people get a better
understanding of that and more comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: familiarity, they're going to find that
they have a lot of control over their
[SPEAKER_01]: health and options, especially as we get
the laws to come into place to mitigate
[SPEAKER_01]: the risk involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll add something to that,
which is we're seeing a big trend on our
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the savvier cannabis consumers
that have been growing their own is really
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly the home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They identify the strains that they really
enjoy either for palliative, medicinal or
[SPEAKER_00]: purely recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think going forward, as home growing
and the stigma of cannabis tends to slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: get washed away, I think people are really
going to be detailing their own treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: for themselves at home, finding that ACDC
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what works for you at home,
not only growing it yourself, but
[SPEAKER_00]: processing it at home yourself,
using either rosin, bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are really the main ways that people
are able to do it safely at home without
[SPEAKER_00]: going the route of open blasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as home growing really picks up and as
this becomes more acceptable, we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to see people tailoring the
strains that they find that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the most out of doing it at home
and repeating that process as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like in Colton, in your case,
you guys had to move to Colorado and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think over time, we're going to
see people really refining their own
[SPEAKER_00]: self-medicating practices for what they
need and what they want and doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: safely and easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I couldn't agree more for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We totally believe here on the farm and
have for years that the plants are a
[SPEAKER_04]: healing plant and instinctively they know
how to heal you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why every grower says they grow
the best weed because they do grow the
[SPEAKER_04]: best weed for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been, and back in the day when we
had patients, we used to bring in an
[SPEAKER_04]: article or their clothes or a picture or
something that had their energy in it and
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they seem to think over the years that
it really was designed for them and really
[SPEAKER_04]: healed them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm all about the home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to keep the home grow
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason why the multimillionaire
corporations down the streets can grow
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of thousands of plants,
but mom and pop can't grow a couple just
[SPEAKER_04]: like they do their tomatoes, peppers and
onions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how we feel on our farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as it moves across the
country, we got to insist that home grows
[SPEAKER_04]: a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's such a deep variety of
cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you and many other people
on this panel could speak much more to
[SPEAKER_00]: that than I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I smoke a traditional chocolo,
I'm not feeling too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people where that really is
what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited to see people being
able to dial this in for themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow their own because it's not a one size
fits all solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been pretty much talking about that
the entire time, whether what part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome this is coming from that you're
getting the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot more that needs to be
done there that goes without saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully more people start growing at
home or talking with their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to be done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that keeps building a lot of
momentum because it's called weed for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not the indoor top shelf mega
stuff, you can still do a really good job
[SPEAKER_00]: at home and come up with a product that
has benefits for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife's totally strain specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been using the hazes and amnesia
haze for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all she ever consumes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the home girl also gets the
the patient because we're all patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ability to find their strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if they're able to grow it
themselves, get the maximum benefit from
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I think that this is why
so we're doing work in California with SB
[SPEAKER_01]: 829 to really protect and for the first
time in the country, establish compassion
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I look at that as the need to
establish and protect the community
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that have developed in
California that might be unique to
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others can speak Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of calls for help for
families there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in California, we had 20 years of the
ability to just kind of work to integrate
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we developed a lot of networks of just
small, local, small time farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They develop little patient networks and
they have time to really get to know and
[SPEAKER_01]: work with the people in their communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that I think needs
to be protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see it as a threat to industry
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that there is a place for
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who need the over the
counter sort of products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are always people who need more
specialized medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that for me, that's why
protecting our small farmers is so
[SPEAKER_01]: important, because they play an integral
role in that sort of communal networking
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis has an opportunity to
provide on a local level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So SB 829 here in California is a bill
that will recognize compassion programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sets up some of the standards for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is looking at developing a new
compassion license type in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that will be a type 13 license for
you Californians who know what that means,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it will be under the medical guise,
we're not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will be a compassion license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also takes the steps to start the
proper tax exemptions for charitable
[SPEAKER_01]: donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it deals with the cultivation taxes and
the excise taxes of making those all
[SPEAKER_01]: exempt from any of those taxes in those
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, we're able to really
maintain some of these programs that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been developed over the years and really
make sure that we can have the benefit of
[SPEAKER_01]: our small time farmer in local networks
that in California are a big risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a big topic now of loss for
the small farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to maintain that community
is really important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it directly relates with the
ability to develop, hone, and provide
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Silas says hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not happy, Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool shirt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we definitely got to fight for
the small farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about this
legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you who are in California,
please familiarize yourself with SB 829.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to need your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a big road to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, you know, it deals with taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need a two thirds vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Senate, we've had to get through a
bunch of appropriations and other
[SPEAKER_01]: committees that have been difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting threats from the
governor's office to potentially veto the
[SPEAKER_01]: bill because just because it has
exemptions, not necessarily the context of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on those things,
but we're going to need all the support we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in California, please
familiarize yourself with SB 829 at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Wiener's office and show us some
support, because it really will be
[SPEAKER_01]: groundbreaking as far as what it will give
us the ability to do to integrate
[SPEAKER_01]: charitable programs as it pertains to
cannabis and how we will interact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, my goal has always been if we can
make the cannabis industry the hero and
[SPEAKER_01]: help the people who aren't able to be
served anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that we're taking away clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these people are either
bedridden, indigent, don't have the funds
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it or using medicines like we talked
about that are very unique to that one
[SPEAKER_01]: person, so there's not a whole product
line developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people just aren't able to get
services.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can make the cannabis industry the
hero for those communities, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that it can be done and make
everybody more profitable and successful
[SPEAKER_01]: in the long run if we take the gift that
comes along with working with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure we spread it out into those
areas of our community that need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things they say is we
get a lot is, well, how come the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry just can't take care of rare
patients, rare seizure disorders,
[SPEAKER_01]: rare disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's kind of a silly question,
but we just got to look at it as how come
[SPEAKER_01]: McDonald's or the supermarket chains
aren't feeding all the homeless and
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding all the hungry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have food programs and some
of them try to integrate social good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's always a need at the local
level for meals on wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or other programs who go right into the
homes of the people who are missed and cut
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the system due to the serious needs
that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can institute that into our
cannabis industry, and if we do so,
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly feel that everybody's going to
benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So SB 829 is really laying the groundwork
to establish the proper tax exemptions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the proper recognition of charities,
and the ability to integrate it into our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry so that there is no waste,
there is no leftovers, there's no need for
[SPEAKER_01]: destruction, everything is funneled into
charitable organizations, and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: wins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, I'm muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oopsie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we didn't get to say goodbye to
Wendy and Colton.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were getting ready for the,
I believe she said it was the county fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, dance competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess her daughter is a big dancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll wish her luck at her competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, what a great conversation today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started as just one of the topics we
were going to have, but it kind of held
[SPEAKER_03]: the conversation all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big one, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got more to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there were people donating money for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send that to you at the Caladrius
Network when I figure out what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's 70 bucks or 100 bucks
or something, but I did see a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: money get donated in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks everyone for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that the group will find
something quite good to do with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it'll go a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you guys, last year I think we
did one and people donated money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to buy cases of dropper
bottles, all those little things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: needed that add up over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you, if you don't mind,
Marcus, we're doing a big fundraiser on
[SPEAKER_01]: August 17th that is just about to be
announced online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some killer bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're doing dinner and those
sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those of you who are in California,
Northern California, if you'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: attend, reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be more of a party than a
dry fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some killer bands coming from San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get the families down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to raffle some things
off, raise some money the old fashioned
[SPEAKER_01]: way and just do some good, you know,
in the foundation of our ability to save
[SPEAKER_01]: lives in our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the cannabis community, the industry,
the consumers, the culture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community as we've stood on their
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get a lot of pats on the back
saying, Hey, for us, good job,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll, you know, I'm just facilitating
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's the community that does is
doing this and they deserve all the
[SPEAKER_01]: credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody in the area come out and say,
hi, then we'll be announcing on our
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram and things like that here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But are you doing a silent auction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're looking for items.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, with raffle tickets and
items, it's, you know, we just need money
[SPEAKER_01]: that can bring in dollars so that people
can, can donate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you own a business, anybody owns a
business or has things they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: donate, you know, other nonprofits,
they have the ability to get tax
[SPEAKER_01]: exemptions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We deal with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not allowed to offer the tax
exemption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all, you know, I often say it's
like all the altruism, all the heart and
[SPEAKER_01]: none of the benefits, you know,
so it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't get cars donated because they're
not able to write them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really lean even more heavily on
just someone saying, Hey, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a write off for this, but you know,
this is a cost that we need to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those days are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll be able to act like a charity
and a nonprofit, but for now we got to
[SPEAKER_01]: scrimp and scrap and fight for every
nickel that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can open the door to more families.
[SPEAKER_03]: So well, I'll donate some products to be
raffled off and I'm sure I could hit up my
[SPEAKER_03]: social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are offering me shit all the time
to shout out their companies and whatnot
[SPEAKER_03]: on my account.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I'll just, I'll put,
I'll put it all on them that maybe they
[SPEAKER_03]: should make a donation to, you know,
not necessarily a shout out, but to just
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's actually really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll shout out anyone who needs,
who needs one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I don't have the audience you
do, but you know, if you're doing good
[SPEAKER_01]: work, you deserve to be told that you're
doing good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, every, every cent goes back
into, uh, the project, because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all volunteers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's my salary that gets the
cut first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is a volunteer organization,
so you know that it's going where it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any plugs would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Lois Lane just kicked down 50 large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's Sterling or if
that's Euro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Euro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, I guess, uh, maybe another 20
minutes rocking on this hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could go till noon possibly,
if there's anything in any particular
[SPEAKER_03]: specific things you guys want to hit and
talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been super stoked on the vapix hail
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't pulled it out in a while in
honor of, uh, Sabo coming in, which he had
[SPEAKER_03]: displayed and never made it back,
but, uh, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe the profile and the taste
on how good it is with this unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is totally it's convection conduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically the difference between putting
something right on a pan that's very hot
[SPEAKER_03]: and vaporizing your material versus
putting your material into a quartz rod,
[SPEAKER_03]: which then goes into a glass tube,
which has been heated from the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like the glass tube heats
up the air inside, which then heats up the
[SPEAKER_03]: courts and there's a preservation that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering the importance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm coming at this just from a
strictly, um, you know, personal
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoyment, uh, place, not necessarily,
Oh, it, you know, makes my back pain stop
[SPEAKER_03]: hurting or whatnot, but just the pure
enjoyment of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering how much that will also
play a part in the future of developing
[SPEAKER_03]: methods of, um, you know, receiving these
cannabinoids through specific materials
[SPEAKER_03]: that retain heat differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore preserve the profile of the
terpenes differently, because you just get
[SPEAKER_03]: a more accurate, in my opinion,
it's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously you get a more, uh, um,
exact, I don't even know how to say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor profile is just so much more on
point when it's preserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just this more enjoyment that's
had from it compared to blowing something
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in my opinion, one of the
worst experiences taking a really hot dab,
[SPEAKER_03]: like at eight or nine hundred plus
degrees, just blasting it off of the
[SPEAKER_03]: courts of the titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, just burning someone's
throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really like the worst way to turn
someone onto cannabinoids in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, giving them that kind of hot dab and
looking for that negative association with
[SPEAKER_03]: taking a dab versus offering someone the
tastiest, most preserved dab at the proper
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature in a, in a, in a normal
amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: That to me is an important part of
cannabis normalization, not killing the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that you're trying to turn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Vapix Hale from way back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because I saw Sabo coming on
and said, you know, I haven't talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy in three years, but we had,
uh, one of their original models when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was working at Massroots a long time ago,
and it ended up in my hands after things
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of went belly up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I do not work for Vapix
Hale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no affiliation with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get anything for saying this,
but you know, it is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I dab at home, that's definitely
the one that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I would agree with bubble man
that, you know, there's a lot of ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: skin a cat on this and a hot dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make somebody never take a dab again
in their life, potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I'm a fan of the Vapix Hale as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty spendy, but you know,
if you're dabbing, uh, semi-regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they're, they're super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm packing mine right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought a nice bong rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bong rip is in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got a chance to try,
you know, some of the live rosin extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: and that bubble man and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what it was called,
Marcus, the, the, the vape pin that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you and Tony worked on together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Gary, Gary developed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, um, that, that thing was,
was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm, I'm not, I don't,
I don't smoke a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cause I can't deal with the,
the THC just, I got too much to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you start introducing the terpene
levels of that, the cleanliness of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I don't know how anyone could
ever go back to a lower quality product at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just that it tasted great,
but when it was able to maintain such
[SPEAKER_01]: high, the effect of it was, it was
completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all of the good, you know,
it mitigated all of the negatives that are
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally associated with,
with too much THC and, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to get you another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's something to be said for,
for the enjoyment of it strictly for the
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's one of the, you know,
one of the main reasons so many people
[SPEAKER_03]: kept the plant for so many years before a
lot of people, a lot of us knew the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: depth of the medicinal values of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always kind of knew it, but then,
you know, like I'll never forget being
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, well, it's not going to,
you know, it's not going to shrink your
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer out of existence, but you could
definitely maintain a higher quality of
[SPEAKER_03]: life by dealing with the nausea from the
chemo and the radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fast forward 10 years, Cristina Sanchez at
the university in Madrid, actually THC
[SPEAKER_03]: does cause apoptosis in cancerous cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, the mind was blown and
it just keeps getting more and more blown
[SPEAKER_03]: as we learn about this important system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The endocannabinoid system that seems to
regulate all biological functions and
[SPEAKER_03]: being done through, you know, taking in
whether consuming, inhaling, vaporizing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets to the point where, and I didn't
say it earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to take things into too
esoteric of an area, but I just feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: a big part of why this hasn't moved as
fast forward as it may have is because the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of politicians you have to go
through to get to that top layer where
[SPEAKER_03]: literally maybe those top three and four
layers are housed almost exclusively by
[SPEAKER_03]: borderline sociopaths, if not complete
sociopaths, people that don't feel
[SPEAKER_03]: empathy, people that don't have
compassion, people that can just watch
[SPEAKER_03]: your child seize right in front of you and
then go in and sign the bill that says,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, no, we're going to keep this stuff out
of existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like there's enough caring
politicians that are in the bottom levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just maybe my own crazy
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you can kind of get through,
but as you get higher and higher,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are these, they're just seemingly
like sociopaths that it wouldn't just be
[SPEAKER_03]: instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what else could be clogging it up and
slowing it down except someone that has no
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to feel empathy or compassion or
to feel someone's pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else could it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with these
[SPEAKER_01]: Senate, just walking into it, we were told
that the Republicans were voting no or
[SPEAKER_01]: abstaining just on party line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the two thirds vote is going to
be so hard in the states right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a two thirds vote on anything
that's just not 51 or 49 is almost
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible with how toxic some of the
politics are here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had, you know, we started a group
working with some other organizations and
[SPEAKER_01]: we had, you know, so we had vets
organizations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have WAM, Women and Men's Alliance for
Medical Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the oldest in California there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had all these different demographics
and we had the Republicans who showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six out of 10 of the senators showed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two Republicans that showed up went
from no votes and flipped and voted yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even abstain, which was going
to be their neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was really,
a good sign that on this level,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least we're still seeing some of that
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the other committees, that wasn't
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them that didn't show up just
voted no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they just, you know, they don't even
read it and vote no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, I have a hard time wrapping
my brain around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how you can be in any position
of control and see the scientific mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: of evidence, the people coming in,
young, old and otherwise saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is benefiting our life and it's
almost impossible to really give credible
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrations of harm, of how it's
harming anybody and just have people
[SPEAKER_01]: really not give any thought to it at all
and just tell them, sorry, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're not going to allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mind boggling to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: There doesn't seem to be many options
other than the fact that potential
[SPEAKER_03]: sociopaths are at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like how else could a plant like
this be kept illegal for so long?
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only kept illegal, but to such a
serious level that kicking doors down,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking children away from families,
putting people in jail for, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: look at Rick DeLisi's father in jail for
98 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he served 31 plus years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that is insane to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to be so worried about
the way this plant affects people,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way this plant gives access to
healing, the way this plant changes the
[SPEAKER_03]: way people think versus the way maybe
potentially they want you to think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely, I've questioned it for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just always tried to understand like
there's something more going on that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: being discussed and it goes deep and it's
borderline frightening and you almost
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to face it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's something else going on when
they can just allow so much suffering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know that they've had patents
on this since the 1970s that they
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the profound healing nature of
cannabinoids, whether they may allow us to
[SPEAKER_03]: realize or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely, I mean, come on,
they do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So playing ignorant makes it even more
scary where it's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Propaganda works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can convince whole communities of
people that reality around them is is
[SPEAKER_01]: something other than what it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've met so many people who
just know that cannabis is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, it's written into their
worldview and their paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in it's hard, you know, this is where
we get into kind of psychology a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But this pertains to a whole bunch of
other subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we see the world for what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are subconscious mechanisms that
want to protect that worldview,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That the influencing of that paradigm is
seen as a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to protect that worldview.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to fit into the community that
they're in who shares that worldview,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's real or not real fantasy or
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's kind of what we're
up against is people, some of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just cold and callous and don't
want to, they don't have time or the
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the others, you know, they just want
to be able to keep control in their
[SPEAKER_01]: communities or they believe to their core
that what they think is real, without ever
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the time to self-evaluate,
why do I believe what I believe?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this obviously is part of the human,
the human condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should do that on all subjects,
not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real problem is people feel that
they have facts and the belief systems
[SPEAKER_01]: that are based in fact that have been
really based out of propaganda and
[SPEAKER_01]: disinformation for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, that's going to take
some time to change because people
[SPEAKER_01]: consciously or not, they resist against
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't want that worldview
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why trauma is such a great
educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why seeing people suffering,
seeing seizures, seeing adults with
[SPEAKER_01]: wasting syndrome, it's traumatic when you
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It influences your brain differently and
it allows for paradigm shifts because the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain associates and starts to see the
risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're able to see the risk,
your brain responds differently than if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just have to imagine what that's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's such a useful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know, families like
Colton and others who are able to put,
[SPEAKER_01]: and adults who are able to put their
suffering out there, as embarrassing as
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, have such a dramatic impact
because people are able to change their
[SPEAKER_01]: thought process in different ways than if
they're just trying to have to imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: that someone says this is good,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good way of putting it,
Forrest, in the way you're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: the paradigm shift of your thought
patterns and the way you see and process
[SPEAKER_03]: information when watching someone go
through those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely is something that could
kickstart just opening up the way you
[SPEAKER_03]: think about things rather than just
believing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the human brain is wired to learn
from kind of fear and trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that evolved need to protect itself,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why, you know, it's easier to,
you know, spank your kids than to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: them over time lessons to have them
ingrained because they'll learn quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: through fear because the brain is designed
to not put yourself in a situation where
[SPEAKER_01]: harm can come again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot longer to integrate new
thought processes and make them a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: ones being through other methods because
we didn't evolve that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's a whole nother
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does, you know, it does help to
really understand why it could,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this going to be a long process,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't go in there and traumatize people
every day to get them to really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: snap out of that paradigm and see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take continued
interaction, continued experiences in
[SPEAKER_01]: their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why everybody who is having,
you know, benefits in their community,
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing that with your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they write you off the first time,
realize that that has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it might if you're not good at
communicating your message.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, a lot of times that's just
that's what happens the first time you're
[SPEAKER_01]: bumping into that protection of their
worldview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just need to it takes more
interaction and it takes getting out there
[SPEAKER_01]: more often and building those
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what some of the most amazing
things I've seen happen through a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: this cannabis activism in the last 10
years is because we've had some laws
[SPEAKER_01]: change and we've been able to get into
more into the community more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really exciting to see some
of those shifts happening in communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm really excited to see
where we're going to be in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think this conversation is going
to look completely different, not only
[SPEAKER_01]: what the industry looks like, but what our
communities look like and how it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look at Billy Caldwell in the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they, you know, he was he had his
medicine taken at the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, no, we're keeping this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a very short period of time,
they were like they wrote something up
[SPEAKER_03]: that allowed him to get that medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was it's not something I thought
I'd see the UK do anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to be so staunch and strict when
it comes to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, GW Pharmaceuticals
exporting tons annually from the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty wild to see that it's slowly
but surely it's starting to happen even in
[SPEAKER_03]: the most hardened of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Wendy mentioned Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oklahoma gave Will Foster 96 years like
less than what was that, 15 or 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago maximum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're implementing a medical
bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it happens in places like Texas and
Oklahoma and the UK, you can definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: feel that you've been making headway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're in California for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like kind of like the sort of
epicenter of the cannabis world where so
[SPEAKER_03]: much of that inspiration came out of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, the exporting of the culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely it is it is, you know,
but I try to people who don't live here or
[SPEAKER_01]: work with like rare patient groups,
you know, we're the we're not out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here in California, it's actually
harder now than it's been in the last 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years to continue to treat our ourselves
and our in the families that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really have those commercial
activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've then we've now made it
inherently illegal and people will lose
[SPEAKER_01]: their license and their livelihood if they
interact with people outside of that
[SPEAKER_01]: network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the good people who are working
with us are like, hey, sorry, we'd love to
[SPEAKER_01]: donate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to do these extractions,
but we're not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's just a lot of again,
we've kind of taken cannabis we've we've
[SPEAKER_01]: locked it in a basement for, you know,
70 years or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're trying to just let it out of
the basement and say, OK, now we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that legal as if that's what
cannabis and the community in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: would have looked like without
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think where the fight is,
is not allowing prohibition and what it
[SPEAKER_01]: did the cannabis to define what it's going
to look like out of outside in the real
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are ways that we don't even
understand that cannabis would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated into our communities,
into our households if prohibition had
[SPEAKER_01]: never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I want to
continue to do is not say what will they
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to do, but help craft,
inform the future of what do we want
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis integration to look like in our
society and just fight for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's very different than just
only having shops with glass countertops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is a lot bigger future out
there if we look at the big picture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: good that we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The type of businesses we can create if we
just kind of step out of that paradigm,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is what cannabis is and look at
all the different ways we can integrate it
[SPEAKER_01]: into our society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's some of the fight that we have
going on here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great to see Oklahoma,
even Texas, like you said, is moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want them to know that if they if
they understand that just that legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: specific commercial activity is by no
means the end of the road, they can start
[SPEAKER_01]: to really craft that from day one and
start to fight those fights now because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've, you know, we're learning some of
them the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken us a long time to get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfortunate that after 20 years,
patient groups and charitable groups and
[SPEAKER_01]: those sort of things are in a worse
position than they've been ever here in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to make sure that changes
again, SB 829 for those of you around
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, with programs like this and
continuing to fight on with good people
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the panel, we're going to we're
going to see cannabis thrive in all sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really exciting to see all these
different aspects of cannabis now come
[SPEAKER_01]: into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a diverse plant with diverse
applications that we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot to talk about for a long time to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right on 12 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0000.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like perfect timing on my clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 0000.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would love to thank everyone for
coming on today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite enjoyable.

[SPEAKER_03]: in touch with you and Forrest can share.

fundraiser.

for so long.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would appreciate if you guys have some
knowledge to share with Brazil.

[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm sitting here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty much on every medium.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Karma Cup or online.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Karma Cup dot com.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I invite everybody to come out to the

an email.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you having me on your panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a most of it is sort of a little
bit above my head as just like a humble
[SPEAKER_08]: grower and extraction type person.
[SPEAKER_08]: So but I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to let everyone know where
how they can get in touch with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the easiest way to reach me is
Wade at House of Harlequin dot org.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have an Instagram thing, but I'm still
learning how it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not very adept in the Internet
world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, you can find a link to that at
Caladrius network dot org as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really can't overemphasize how.
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, one of the things that's really
beautiful about Forrest and the work that
[SPEAKER_09]: he's doing with the Caladrius network is
it's really capturing the essence of what
[SPEAKER_09]: is the intention about your work with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at one extreme is compassionate use
and need.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at another extreme, and neither is
good or bad or right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just an observation is the
opportunity to support yourself and your
[SPEAKER_09]: family and your life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the ways that that dichotomy,
I think, can be brought together is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm stoned as well, so I'm going to
stop there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just intention is really I think an
essential part of working with cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: and both over the counter versions of
cannabis as medicine and pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_09]: prescription grade, not from a drugstore,
but from someone you know or someone in
[SPEAKER_09]: your own family.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's medical benefit with the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the real miracle here is the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of you who sit in on this event
that happens for bringing yourself and
[SPEAKER_09]: your expertise and your heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: To what we're talking about here,
because the plant is the miracle,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we are bringing it out of that
basement of prohibition into the light.
[SPEAKER_09]: The true nature of how it is as a plant
and as a healing part of our lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the end of my stoned rap for
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Marcus, for hash church.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, Wade, and thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love your authenticity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer Tom, did you want to share with us
how you can how we can get in touch with
[SPEAKER_03]: you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can find me at Farmer Tom on
Facebook, Farmer Tom on Instagram,

Twitter.

Barcelona.

ICBC, an international cannabis business
[SPEAKER_03]: conference, the day before in conjunction
with the Spannibus guys, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure he'll announce it when it's
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a shout out to my friends
at Green Artos over there in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a really good shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go and visit them.

D420K on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming in, dude.

[SPEAKER_13]: Ball and rip, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_13]: One more before we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more before we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dr. Mark Sheldon, how about you?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we find you online?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm connected to you, but how does
everyone else find you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you find me online?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just search.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess on my Facebook, but certainly you
can reach out to Mark as Mark's been with
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm currently a director of science at
CULTA.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look at CULTA's C-U-L-T-A.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a Facebook page and an Instagram
page, and we're having a party in our
[SPEAKER_05]: grand opening at our dispensary next
Saturday in downtown Baltimore,
[SPEAKER_05]: 215 on a key highway, which is really
close to the inner harbor and a nice part
[SPEAKER_05]: of downtown Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be in the area,
do stop in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to have bands and a
food truck and all kinds of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a couple of other projects going on
all throughout the country, but you could
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly find our work there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my crew there, Michelle and
Lacey doing a great job and chase over at
[SPEAKER_05]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we've been making great live
resin and shatters, and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: introducing just in time for 710.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our vape pens, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's based on trying to do it for
710.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the DMT vape pens you've been
working on?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, I'd love to work on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard they exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, these are going to be dangerous
vape pens.
[SPEAKER_06]: No DMT vape pens.
[SPEAKER_06]: These crazy kids these days, I'll tell
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But soon, those will be on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the next generation of product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming on, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me- Yeah, thanks for having me,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to be on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always, always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Bubbleman, BCBubbleman on Instagram
and Bubbleman Brand as well on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Bubbleman's World,
the channel you're watching right now on
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll finish it off with Forrest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell us about how we can get in
touch with him and how you guys can help
[SPEAKER_03]: support them, either donating products
from companies that you know of or that
[SPEAKER_03]: you personally own to straight up
donations as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hey, thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really happy to see everybody again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just glad Task Church is up and
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the Colladrius Network,
which is at thecolladriusnetwork.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weird word, I know,
C-A-L-A-D-R-I-U-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same on Instagram at
Colladrius Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at at Forrest underscore herd,
H-U-R-D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you can reach out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not on social media a whole bunch
because we're busy, but definitely been
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping it up more with all the need to
organize with political action if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, donations can go in through the
website or you can email myself at Forrest
[SPEAKER_01]: with two R's, F-O-R-R-E-S-D at
colladriusnetwork.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say that the Colladrius
Network is one of many grassroots
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations that are trying to do good
in their community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that ATN and the veterans
organizations are working hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's organizations that are
working with adult cancer patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: AIDS-wasting patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just encourage everybody,
you know, hey, you wanna help the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colladrius Network?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it and we would be grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are likely people in your own
community that are just as desperate and
[SPEAKER_01]: just as good of a cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just encourage everybody out
there to just take a time and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what's around and get involved with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not only is it a good cause,
but it can add a level of fulfillment to
[SPEAKER_01]: your work with cannabis that could really
be a game changer in your own daily life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing what working for others who
have it worse than you do can do to
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your meaning in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reach out to us or find someone in your
community that needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't thank you guys enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in California, remember SB
829.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of, in my opinion, the most critical
roles for just doing what is right as it
[SPEAKER_01]: pertains to cannabis in our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most critical bills that's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we get it passed in California,
it's a domino that could tip to the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, all of your support would be
welcomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks again everybody for having me
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everyone who's watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have over 400, almost 420 people
watching live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we closed in on around 600 today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, let's try to meet up again next
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye everybody.
Thanks for watching.
