[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over something with you in
regards to the infamous hash whiting out
[SPEAKER_00]: Also known as buttering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it with water hash where the
water hash wasn't properly dried The wax
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane was still hydrated when it was
pressed And this allows the water to
[SPEAKER_00]: become trapped with those resins that are
inside the glandular trichome head Today
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be dealing with dry sift,
but what we found was sometimes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift when we keep it real nice powder
If it heats up in any way shape or form
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll grease up and stick to itself And
generally if you allow that puck that's
[SPEAKER_00]: once stuck together now it seems to work
almost as low as though it's a desiccant
[SPEAKER_00]: it literally pulls moisture out of the air
and Re I guess it creates that white
[SPEAKER_00]: effect where the it just butters out I
have a little bit of the barb that was
[SPEAKER_00]: bone dry powder when I brought it to
Treating yourself show and what I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: is I've broken it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of buttered out I've broken it
up onto the Oil slick and I've laid it
[SPEAKER_00]: down here on my stainless steel Barbecue,
I guess the drawer that's right next to
[SPEAKER_00]: the barbecue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and hot heating up in the Sun
and I'm going to show you how to simply
[SPEAKER_00]: with a Little bit of heat we can get this
stuff back to a nice shattery product a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice dabble product So I'm gonna pause the
camera gonna flip the camera around and
[SPEAKER_00]: show you what I'm doing and we'll get
right back to it Okay All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the the surface of this Stainless steel
is hot not not extremely hot, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: guessing that with just a little bit of
pressure I'll be able to get this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly pressed now what I'm also gonna do
not just with This sort of pressure you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got two different things that pressure
create An enormous amount of pressure will
[SPEAKER_00]: create heat and that heat will help with
the process of pressing Sometimes when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a buttery hash like this and it
doesn't want to press completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pressing pretty nice a Little bit
stuck to the top there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see we got a decent press there a
little bit of a Hair stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how I could help this as you've seen
I've already pro it's pretty decent but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a bit Still crumbly, but how we can
help this is with a simple lighter and
[SPEAKER_00]: just fan the top of the hash Fan the top
of the hash try not to burn yourself nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and gentle fanning because it's windy the
hash is Is heating up slow and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give it another real nice press and I can
feel it already in between the oil slick
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's That it's A little softer this
time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gazillion ways to do this People
do this way by pressing it in their shoe
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this one's gonna stick a little bit
more Alright, so she's stuck on that side,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is perfect because now we'll light
the other side with the lighter And a real
[SPEAKER_00]: gentle lighting I'm not really getting it
to bubble up or anything like that Just
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting it and moving it around fanning
it to give that little bit of heat that
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow us to Just give it that final
press And then what I like to do after I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: done with with a press like this Is I'll
go put it in the fridge or the freezer
[SPEAKER_00]: just for a few seconds Not that not a
super long time and I'll put this in the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll open it up and we'll see what we got
Alright, so we've just taken this out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the freezer I was only in there for about
a minute, but now you can see we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice dabble product From something that
was completely whiting out you can now
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the dabs in one whole piece and Yeah,
there it is a Little bit of a press a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a heat another way you could
have done this really simply put I could
[SPEAKER_00]: have put boiling water inside of this
Lemonade glass and just literally rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: over the hash with the hot water inside
Here that'll transfer enough of the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: to melt that resin up bring those oils
back out and get yourself a nice Dabble
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time to go dab a bowl All
right, so our little piece of hash Dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: it up
[SPEAKER_00]: You You
[SPEAKER_00]: You You You You You
