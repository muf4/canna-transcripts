[SPEAKER_02]: Full melt Full melt Full melt Full melt
Full melt
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some dry sift that's been out
in the sun for like two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still nice and glittery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the voice that you're hearing could
only be one man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one and only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest finest Cuban grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we just left Sasquatch and he showed
us some cool rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I feel strongly there's only
one person in the game that's doing like,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, when you talk about hashish and
you talk about resin, I mean, this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just perfect little heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like little bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been in the sun for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that little gooeyness is just the
heads kind of melting and becoming like
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this process where the heads are
breaking down and the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything are coming together for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the preservation for that to be for
hours is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have bought three grams myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the street we call that greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these have been out in the sun for two
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface of this is right here.
It's hot.
It's so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 100 degrees or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been out on display.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this has right here is vacuum
dried, not freeze drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a technique that I've been using
since I started making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to freeze drying where I use
a backing pump to pull up pressure and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a cold trap in line to capture the
ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot more, I don't know,
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a 1.9 AI oven for like 700
bucks and a good backing pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put two or three in line and you can dry a
lot of hash per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these here, we put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever taken a really terpy rosin
and put that under vacuum and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: that does?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why I don't vacuum my rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do with these rosins here,
I press them at a temperature where they
[SPEAKER_00]: already start to nucleate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's five star, I don't know,
I almost think it's because I'm in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: as well in my cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a natural higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you press it, it will come out
shatter, sappy and then have some
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I use is just a little bit of
heat and just a lot of whips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to start whipping to
agitate the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stick it in the vac and the vac will
be, I don't know, 110 degrees or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already waxing up by itself pretty
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll pull a vac at like 15 and shut
off the valve just to puff it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is all those little
bubbles, they end up waxing and they give
[SPEAKER_00]: it like a fat texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I don't pull a long vac,
it's like the shortest part of my process,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't lose a lot of flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But y'all, you don't know how many times
I've had loud rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I made the vitamin CBD oil and
the emerald cup, when I first came out to
[SPEAKER_01]: California, I had a 30% terpene profile
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all this crazy unbelievable flower
oil for flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually put that under vac,
like what you just said, and tried that
[SPEAKER_01]: and it white muffins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and I shut it off and it
like left in this like perfect white like
[SPEAKER_01]: muffin, you know, because there's so much
terpene spit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just stayed like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happened was I let that stay
for like 12 hours just in its place and I
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly decompressed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it came back, it was like this
crazy consistency that was like the
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we kind of got that from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's funny because I was trying
to now do that without doing that because
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, if you go too far,
everything's gone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with cold traps, you can always
re-add it, but I tried to preserve it as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as I can, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this resin here, besides the
collaboration with the dry synth and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, is all grown by my wife,
indoors from her first crop in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: washed by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first time I'd washed in
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's why you have such the mother
load here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you know, I haven't washed
any resin in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing with California is that it
costs a lot of money to build a cold lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a cool bot, the proper size,
AC, electricity and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be pretty diehard about making
ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of cats like with this type of
temperature, they can't really wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like winter washers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a pretty good lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can wash whenever, hottest days of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take advantage of it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come out here and I try to offer the
fire to people that would normally buy it
[SPEAKER_00]: at shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them direct wholesale price and
bring as much as I can so I can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you get a lot of good feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that came through,
patients that came through, they were like
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited, as I was, to grab,
you know, different types of synth that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people, even in the synth
world, where are like, oh, I got 99,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like so many people who claim
I got 99, 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you just take a macro camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have a little keychain that does 20
on my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go and look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you see any contaminants,
you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like 85 to like 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so when I first started making dry
synth, I never had like a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, like I remember the first time
I would get like cleaner and cleaner and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color of the hash would change and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got to a point where it would melt just
like water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any contaminant or stocks or things
like that, I like acquired like a taste
[SPEAKER_00]: for it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my process, it's a pretty stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like make hash and test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get pretty high in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you find out, you know, you got to
quality control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first time I did get a scope,
it was beautiful when I saw it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I went to a buddy's house and he
had like one of those, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an electron microscope or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some crazy microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put the hash on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super psyched, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he saw just blew his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at it and it was blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just all heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and he took some of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it should look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it looks like beautiful little
captured eggs everywhere, like soft eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good type of hash to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still your proprietary type of
tech, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to keep it low key because when
I won my first cannabis cup, I really came
[SPEAKER_00]: up out of just hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, didn't really know anybody in
the game, do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of guys in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you in Seattle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you in Seattle too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a lot of fake people came on
through and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and it made it kind of sour
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know, I'm like a
private person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I taught a lot of my family and my
close friends and people that really love
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to do people tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I just like to share the
joy of dry soup to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give them a lot of tips,
like people that are up and coming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I think there's a screen that they can
use to improve their quality by a lot or a
[SPEAKER_00]: drying process, a curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost give it all my techniques out in
pieces and parts, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was like talking about terpenes,
I'm like, well, I mean, the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: cutthroat, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like when you work really hard and you
do have a family around you, you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: do have to hold on to what you can to be
able to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you don't get swallowed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have to respect that part in the
particular game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cutthroat right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do the same thing with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes a little circle and then try
to, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine when you first started
making terpenes, a lot of people came up
[SPEAKER_00]: to you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the type of shit I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I like real people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fuck with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good luck up there today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we're in the same category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll feel, I'll feel honored if I could
take second to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like perfection in hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: No,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just so beautiful though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's, let's dab it real quick
before these awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do your cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And X1 best food in Michigan, giving out
free dabs out of the scars and three first
[SPEAKER_00]: place glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at a connoisseur level at this,
you'll probably have something really good
[SPEAKER_01]: to compliment that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's as many trichome heads in
this as smoking a fat blunt, except he's
[SPEAKER_00]: about to smoke it all in one dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, like that much smoke
should have like just made me cough
[SPEAKER_01]: horribly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super smooth for sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably like a quarter gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fat choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, I would say a quarter gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quarter gram of sift to the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good luck on stage today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to see you up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely earned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried the water now?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for another dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This job doesn't suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble man, we've got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got you covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're five minutes away from the awards
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do the dab though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at those little heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminds me of perfect sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as big.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's like, you want a big dab again?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, not as big.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, all right, well, let me give it
to you bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This micron is the same as the dry sift
that you just made, but translated from
[SPEAKER_00]: LPI to micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you enter that too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just the essence and light
sweetness of a cookie and that cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a standard, like when you eat
ice cream, if that's like a base to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just for the quality,
it has a very high yield and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: find that, you know, in hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one of a kind cross for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, my brother, I'll see you over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're that close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
All right.
