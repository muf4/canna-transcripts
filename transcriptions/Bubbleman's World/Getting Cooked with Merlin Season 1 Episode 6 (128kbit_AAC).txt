[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a big crew to introduce you
today for our Cooking with Merlin episode
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 6.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 6.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get right to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some folks in from my hometown.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are Winnipeggers, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure we're in Tennessee right now,
but I've lived in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, introduce yourselves guys to the
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure the cannabis community
probably knows you and your battle that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got going on right now,
but yeah, give a little introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to start, Simon, or should I lead
her off?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you go ahead.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey everybody, this is the Tover Grown
team.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the tech wizard, camera wizard,
and troll wizard.
[SPEAKER_07]: We launched a lawsuit against the Manitoba
government a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say that one more time?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so nice to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: We launched a lawsuit against the Manitoba
government a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also got asked to join the Quebec
lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're fighting two provincial
governments at once.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are my boys who are helping out
in the background and doing a big
[SPEAKER_07]: difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Aaron?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've done a lot of the photos and
videos and different marketing strategies
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And lately we've been making lots of
videos just like hilarious shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to get comedic with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lighting the vibe, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Simon, I know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go back a little ways, not super far,
but you're doing your... I'm just helping
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the tech side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I can and can't,
so I'm just... He's understating his help
[SPEAKER_02]: as Simon likes to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our hacker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super glad to have you guys all in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you guys were raging with Remo the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That must have been fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all three of us were the highest
we've ever been.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all three of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week cooking was an episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't smoke the joints fast enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also just raged hard with Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great to see you guys in that
zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have all sorts of things to
talk about just in regards to the raging
[SPEAKER_02]: that we all did with Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you that obviously
haven't hung out with Remo but have
[SPEAKER_02]: watched his videos, you still know Remo
loves to go hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a true cannabis warrior,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: A true cannabis warrior, a cannabis
aficionado, a true lover of the plant on
[SPEAKER_02]: every level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty stoked that these guys
brought me the Megastoner Super High
[SPEAKER_02]: album, which is Remo's new I guess kind of
metal band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, metal band.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is his new metal band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brixton's all over you, eh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so everyone knows there's a little
velociraptor at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's chewing on you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's so cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we're gonna cook some food
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys want to tell them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell them, Merlin,
what design of the recipe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a rainy day, so I thought we'd
do a soup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do some spring rolls and some
ramen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would warm me up on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: On a cold rainy day and the winter is
coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dumping up and whistling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, major dumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been raining here like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I did get my drone resorted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The battery died on my Phantom 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got that battery replaced and
every day that we film this for the last
[SPEAKER_02]: like two or three cooking with Merlin's,
I thought if the rain ends, I'll shoot the
[SPEAKER_02]: drone out for a little visual because part
of this episode, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the magic is the view and today
it's not really there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even see the mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just some trees and some fog,
but it is pretty beautiful when you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually we're gonna get that drone
up there and we'll get some drone footage
[SPEAKER_02]: cut into these videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, quick little session,
smoke some joints, light some bowls,
[SPEAKER_02]: get iry and then get into the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, Merlin has a lot of sous chefs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna be on the camera,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can film some, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys are probably gonna be in sous
chef position.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm guessing Merlin's probably
gonna need one of you to serve him dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: and joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably one of you will get that job.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Simon's normal job when he's in my
table as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put Remo to work the other day and it
took him only about 10 minutes to realize
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe I should get Remo to be rolling
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely not a shot against Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did great in the work that he was
doing, but when he said, what was his
[SPEAKER_02]: quote?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can burn water.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he said that, I felt a little bit of
the confidence erode out of Merlin's soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's switch this guy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm sitting beside Merlin,
I do the best I can to stay out of his
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He moves like fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: He moves like fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should try holding a camera on the
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wide angle lens helps because if I had
the normal camera lens that this camera
[SPEAKER_02]: has, I'd have to like stand in the back
corner over by the skateboard deck that
[SPEAKER_02]: some of you have noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll see if any of you others
notice the skateboard deck this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, it's time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone can see this stuff is
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this Marcus?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some forum cut cookies from Ethos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually was produced and grown by
Concentrated X in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Concentrated X for keeping me
in stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully with the work that I have signed
up for with Merlin and his company,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully this year we're going to get
that bubble man brand out to you guys and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll have some products that are
deserving to be on the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a difficult thing to create
exceptional quality products in the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of work, a lot of hurdles,
but we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still beats having a gun put in your
face and having your kids taken away in
[SPEAKER_02]: your dog shot, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not much stress to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a familiar with falling
film or rising film evaporators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is kind of what that's based
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on pulling the resin up into
this part of the, not letting the dab just
[SPEAKER_02]: be taken on the pan, but getting it pulled
into this little tube that's also heated
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the little marble inside is just
moving it around to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: painting and touching as much of that
surface area as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to reduce oxygen as well as this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes it that tighter little pull.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, shout out to Nephalem glass
because basically you can pull it off and
[SPEAKER_02]: the turf slurper really only works with
these three components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of needed to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily for me, the Nephalem glass
lined me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, watch out for pickle Rick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a pickle Rick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carburetor cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: What temperature did you hit that at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you not know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cold started?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a cold start, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to know my temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a little thermometer that gives
me an accurate readout on how hot my
[SPEAKER_02]: banger is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could imagine it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: How hot was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now, it's like 350.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit it pretty low though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like eight seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's like the fourth time in my
life I've ever done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sounds like you got a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm one and done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys own one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love your dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's boiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it at?
[SPEAKER_02]: 320, 398, 400 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seems ridiculous,
but if you dab a lot, knowing the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature of the banger and the amount
of time that you heat it up, it changes
[SPEAKER_02]: from banger to banger, depending on the
thickness, the type of material that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: made out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, for instance, people that really
like, if you want to take the rocket ship
[SPEAKER_02]: to the moon, a warmer or hotter
temperature will get you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone that's accidentally taken a hot dab
knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that didn't seem too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was low temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just total rookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, or here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smoke cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smoke cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally have stopped doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarettes can have an effect on your
lungs for certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, smoking a good dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can get you coughing, whether you're a
super hot dab or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're last, my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: You like elephants, eh, Marilla?
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: You like elephants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Marilla, I'm straight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't like elephants?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's sit in there for the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of a poltergeist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask him.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we're going to get in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, we're all baked and off on
our own tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to the kitchen,
make some food, and enjoy this high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eat the food, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're here with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if his intro will be as stony as
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were pretty baked last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that we can top that one,
but today we'll try and put together some.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can top it the next time we have Remo.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got the guys from Toba Grown here as
well.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to make some ramen and
some spring rolls with a peanut butter
[SPEAKER_05]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Jesse, you're going to help me out of
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll do the spring rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do the first one and then show you
exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can roll the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I get some gloveys off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like rolling doobies,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like rolling doobies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying you don't have good doobie
rolling skills?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're veggie doobies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to put it into a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you hit more often than not?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rice paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: More so now, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just put it into a plate with some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice paper into a plate with some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally just layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let it soak for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll get yours going as you get
your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have everything prepared pretty much
here already.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some cilantro, some sprouts,
some red pepper, cucumber, some cooked
[SPEAKER_05]: tofu with ginger and soy sauce and garlic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be good with the carrots
and a bit of avocado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some chives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't want to go too long or these
things get some back story.
[SPEAKER_07]: Merlin and I used to work together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually lived in this house for about
four or five nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right when I moved in, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right when you moved in.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was lots of weed smoke then,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get it going for the ramen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get the onions at the... Little
onion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at these creeps over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get them in the shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's going on over here,
guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got good art, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Checking all the decks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check that one out up there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Way back when in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to put another one in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll show you how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just hydrating these rice paper
wraps?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just hydrating them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we get a little bit of carrot in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just Subway style?
[SPEAKER_05]: Subway style, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of avocado.
[SPEAKER_05]: You taking this down, Jesse, or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, mentally.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of onions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon knows how good I roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of cucumber in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you should roll that and
roll that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen him roll a jar?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not look good, but it'll work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold it on your sides there to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the name of my contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just tuck it in, just like your
doobies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuck it in, just like your doobies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, prepare to be amazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect spring roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me try one there, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prepare to be amazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some eggs over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some newies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got all the noodles ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some tofu will reheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had already done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we're doing that, let's get this
broth going.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the most important part of the
ramen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, the ramen broth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Favorite ramen spot in Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Jin Ya.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jin Ya is baller.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit of grape seed oil in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big fan of the neutral oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some ginger to start it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong start in the background there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep the camera over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's happening over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fan of the ginger myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a little garlic in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a Vicks vapor rub when you put
the ginger in there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As these onions come to, let's turn that
heat up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do onions and mushrooms for
inside the ramen soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramen soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toba Grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Jesse, how about you speak a little
bit about what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: As you're finishing your first one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, perfection.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Toba Grown was started in April.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this April will be two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lawsuit against the Manitoba
government's ban on homegrown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when the ban first came into
place in 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was working with Merlin at the time and
really annoyed me, but I wasn't at the
[SPEAKER_07]: time personally affected by it because I
didn't have a place where I could grow and
[SPEAKER_07]: was traveling for work.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when COVID came around and our
government instructed us to find creative
[SPEAKER_07]: and constructive projects to work on
during lockdown, I started researching how
[SPEAKER_07]: I could launch this lawsuit and went
shopping for lawyers and launched the
[SPEAKER_07]: initial lawsuit in August after about four
and a half months of diligence and
[SPEAKER_07]: shopping through lawyers, which was a lot
of fun in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you want to tell us who you ended
up with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I started with MLT.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a massive firm across Western
Canada and they built a very strong
[SPEAKER_07]: foundation in water research and what we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I then transitioned to Daniel Tronopinski,
which is a smaller single lawyer,
[SPEAKER_07]: just to control the legal bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because obviously the big firm,
you pay more.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just us initially funding this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's been a learning curve and a
half.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm really happy with the amount of
community support we have behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about being a local hero when that
lawsuit goes through and you win the
[SPEAKER_02]: rights for all Manitobans to grow their
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's going to be dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a right that we all earn here that
it should happen in legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the last bit of activism left onto
the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last fight and the premier who was
recently appointed in Manitoba is actually
[SPEAKER_07]: the one who wrote the ban.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's publicly stated she will defend
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So looking like it'll be a fight till the
end, which probably is a year and a half
[SPEAKER_07]: from now until.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so on the wrong side of history.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't even know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your next fight should even not tax us to
death trying to sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Manitoba is actually the best tax in
Canada as far as excise, but the rest of
[SPEAKER_05]: the country, you get slaughtered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where can people go and read about
this and support this?
[SPEAKER_07]: So Simon, actually, he met earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's built an awesome website like
tobagrown.ca and .com.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're on all the social media platforms
under tobagrown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tobagrown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aaron's done some amazing footage for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see a lot of the funny videos and high
quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to that guy right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got some team members who are in
here, but who are drooling over the
[SPEAKER_07]: footage, watching us eat this delicious
food.
[SPEAKER_07]: And full disclosure, I'm 11 out of 10
baked right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooking food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we do it here on getting baked
with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, getting cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cooking with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like we should switch it to getting
cooked with Merlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that might have to be it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There goes the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put some shiitake mushrooms in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to level them out,
let them grill, get that water out,
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure it seals in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, only on cooking with Merlin can you
go from like a full blown federal lawsuit
[SPEAKER_02]: to why we put the mushrooms in with the
onions and how they're going to affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: broth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit of that soup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're back to federal lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, man, everyone, I mean, Marcus,
you're from you're from Manitoba and you
[SPEAKER_05]: tell me you were you started the first
activism for hemp in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we were we were the first yeah,
in Manitoba, we were probably the first
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was just like it was like Martin
and Alex and Neil and John.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys were all kind of the core
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there were other people from the
University of Manitoba who started a hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: group that were a part of it and other
activists that came into play like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Paul de Felice and Alan
Middlemas from Nelson, from the Kootenays,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Holy Smokes guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of people were a part of it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I feel lucky enough to be able
to say that we got that license for that
[SPEAKER_02]: first five acre experimental field in
nineteen ninety five and driving my
[SPEAKER_02]: Volkswagen van through that hemp field was
in a way that was like the first cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: activism in Manitoba.
Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might have been people in the 70s
and the 60s because that I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: missed that boat and not been,
you know, like I remember the rock shop
[SPEAKER_02]: used to sell pipes and kind of like
different kind of weed positive things,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I guess in a sense during
Prohibition, that would still be part of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a bit of activism, you know,
where you're like, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're selling stuff to smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm putting in here is some red miso
paste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organic miso.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Red type.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put a nice I'll remember to
add the recipe last week too as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to add in a little bit of
dashy paste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dashy paste?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to give you a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was totally joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard you guys conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to run through the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get your coronas, but not the corona.
[SPEAKER_05]: The coronas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's similar to miso.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is miso actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just another corona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooking with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got more rice kicking around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's like these, you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not rice, sorry, carrots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we'll have to grate up some more.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many you got done there?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have four done?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have four done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll have to grate up some more
carrots here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grate them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: As this heats up, this should start to
kind of turn into a broth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the rolling here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guess which one is not mine?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they all look pretty darn good,
man.
I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you did it better than I could have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to roll that one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot the most important part.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little avocado.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to screw up this roll now that
the camera's on.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the pressure's on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got this, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just think of this as your lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're rolling up your lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to focus on it and make sure
you execute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everyone can smoke weed
everywhere that they grew in their
[SPEAKER_05]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, and Winnipeggers will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely they will.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Québécois.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Québécois.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're in it too, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course Quebec did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's for you, Simon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they may have turned the law
around in Quebec, but Quebecers act like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's still in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four plants are still allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: How could it not be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing it since 1976.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's 400, not four.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the good old Quebec mentality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone just want to help me out here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Simon's jumping in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's jumping in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's ready to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need you to crack the eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: He almost took his shirt off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack the eggs?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to get the skins off?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like my eggs with shells.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like my egg shells without egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use egg shells for one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just egg shells on yours?
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be delicious, eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess we'll make the peanut
sauce while we're waiting for these to
[SPEAKER_05]: finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to do a little dash of
cilantro?
[SPEAKER_05]: A little dash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cilantro bay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll have to wash them off after,
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the peanut sauce, we will do peanut
butter, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to get a couple spoons of that
in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some coconut milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Voila.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little can of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to put a little bit of soy
sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of soy sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of Sriracha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a little bite.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of garlic.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of lime juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to put a little bit
of this as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, which one's that now?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of sesame oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little shot of sesame oil,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: In there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a little bit of miso as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty tasty in there while we're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost held back, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost held back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought twice about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This miso is super salty, but I'm not
going to put any salt in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to place it with the miso.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll kind of fit with the dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of ginger.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the spoon tack again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spoon tack.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to pour that up with the sauce
as well, or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to lime in here as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we put a little bit of lime already
in there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll get that on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need a Vitamix sponsor.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll hit them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are good units.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is tasty, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut butter, ginger, goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh spring rolls, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushrooms are looking proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper mushrooms are on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to look like your miso broth is
looking proper too, I'll say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now let's spice up this miso broth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put a little bit of ponzu
sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of tempura, which is pretty
much it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of soy sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Salty goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Salty deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of rice wine vinegar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, rice wine vinegar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a little bit of sesame oil in
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice dash of that, got a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll add in here vegan on this soup
with a little bit of pea-powered milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it the creaminess, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd the ignition go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good and ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're ready to go on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as soon as this broth is up and
boiling, we'll put all the parts together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, making some portions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some portions out of the noodles for
the ramen noodle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is your statement?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your statement with your one white
bowl?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the white sheep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the white sheep.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure Simon gets that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon gets that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll just heat these up real
quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had already pre-fried them before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just get a little extra crisp on
them before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my noodles here that are tofu
noodles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the tofu noodles.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the gluten-free people out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the gluten-free people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very considerate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty much good there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get the broccoli in the broth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's boiling here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the broccoli in the broth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that they cook into the broth and soak
up all the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll pour the hot broth into the
cooked noodles after.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what to do with this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna do the bok choy in there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Broccoli and bok choy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna make more flavor in the whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: It already looks better, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these are heating right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did your spring roll mission go?
[SPEAKER_05]: It went good, eh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's plate the spring rolls while this is
cooking real quick here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This shouldn't take too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of want to keep the crisp while
this is going here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put it in the fridge if you like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Time to plate the spring rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every good kitchen has some good knives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, these are looking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really good save.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happens in a stoner kitchen.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are not the tightest rolled joints
over here, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog's like, yeah, lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all about air pockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good flow?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: These have incredible flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually call these air pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be like the product name if we sold
them in grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jesse, when do you plan on closing out
Tobago and when do you think that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna get a resolution?
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta think of law cases in three
stages.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Quebec, for example.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2019 they had their first stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there was an appeal, which is stage
two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Supreme Court is stage three.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quebec Supreme Court, stage three,
will be a year and a half from now.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Manitoba we're gonna have our stage one
court proceedings in February,
[SPEAKER_07]: March.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then roughly six to eight months after
that we'll be in the appeal court.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all in all, for Quebec and Manitoba to
start growing weed is probably a year and
[SPEAKER_07]: a half to two years away if the
governments continue to fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a long ways away before anyone's
gonna be able to grow their stuff at their
[SPEAKER_05]: house legally at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hundreds of thousands in legal bills
on both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hundreds and thousands.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on their side it's taxpayers paying
for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are you raising the funds?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been selling t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: People have been buying them like crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so funny seeing them all around
Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_07]: People walking into grocery stores and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a GoFundMe that's really bumping
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Green Planet for your latest
donation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a big surprise for early
January that I'm working on Merlin with to
[SPEAKER_07]: help really bolster our legal bill fund.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, I'm happy to help.
[SPEAKER_07]: More to come on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: These look amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, these are pretty much ready right
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're nice and poached, full of flavor
from this broth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulling out the bok choy and the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are out, we'll keep these to the
side and start filling our molds over
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it looks spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: As it always does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good soup on a cold rainy day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't want that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, this is on point right now,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think you're really, I've never
cooked this for you before, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, you're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're one of your top dishes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually thanks to my girlfriend,
Kim.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is her recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here, actually, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Kim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: She makes ramen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she has a ramen tattoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how much she loves ramen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that's ramen commitment.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ramen commitment right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to put a little bit of broccoli,
a little bit of broth in each one of
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're doing a fine job of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do some good molds here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might as well just move these closer so
that we can do this real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little type A action in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like we're going to speed
through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: On point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now first step is done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's going there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start to build our dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with our bok choy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a few little bok choy on the side
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got tofu's going in too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fried tofu with some nice oil and a
little salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's super tasty like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you got mushrooms going in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't have an episode without
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's get a little bit of these onions
in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or wait, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the, I forgot, these Brussels
sprouts a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Baked in the oven?
[SPEAKER_05]: Baked in the oven with a little bit of
sesame oil and sriracha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is all going into the ramen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All going into the ramen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is over the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly quite something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone wants it,
but you guys like a little chunk of butter
[SPEAKER_05]: I suggest as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goes in this ramen as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little chunk of butter in each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just gives it a nice little creaminess as
it melts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so everyone knows, this is a razor
sharp knife, so I'll try not to cut
[SPEAKER_05]: myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, try to not cut yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use your skill.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now those are all cut and in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Off with the gloves.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put a little bit of sesame seeds on
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus, you just keep making it look
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the shallot onion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also do it, and then also just
a few of these little bean sprouts in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, some people like to fry the bean
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like them crunchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put them in right at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there we have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramen soup for five plus some spring
rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get it on the table,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're straight crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You like my Asian dishes, don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all your dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: From every culture that you've pulled out
from, they've all been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no complaints there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Merlin just crushed that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of us sort of stood around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a pretty good job, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just held the camera as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, as much appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You provided the dabs as well to inspire
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching you create this was
inspirational.
[SPEAKER_02]: The noodles, and then the bok choy,
then some broccoli, and then some
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms, and then the tofu, and then you
pulled these Brussels sprouts out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: oven, and then there's an egg going in
there with sesame, and then sprouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a seventh thing edition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't forget the butter, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you finished it with the butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the butter is now melting into a
pretty goodness.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess as always, we will take the
first few bites, let you know what we
[SPEAKER_02]: think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a tea, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have chopsticks, so I got the
fork.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start with the spring roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking that myself, but it's just
like so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have three seconds before he's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: This meal does perfectly match the weather
outside.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Soup season is year round.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that I was pushed for the Sundays,
too, with different vegetarian stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: coming up every week.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this is absolutely delicious,
as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm giving some love to this
spring roll as well.
Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is really tricky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good?
[SPEAKER_07]: Those onions and those Brussels sprouts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spring roll is delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people would eat more vegetables
if they could make them taste like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so on point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got so quiet all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: These videos always end up quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll thank our guests for visiting
this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys, for making an appearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we can do another one with you
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Braxton, for all the
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for chewing my shoe, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks, Merlin, as always,
for cooking the delicious food and serving
[SPEAKER_02]: it up, as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this.
We got this.
