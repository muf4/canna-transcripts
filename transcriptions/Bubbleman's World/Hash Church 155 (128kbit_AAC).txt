[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 155.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I wasn't we were gonna make this one
in the middle of Toronto, literally six
[SPEAKER_10]: minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow I managed to make it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hope for the best when it comes to
the connection.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful connection is gonna be today.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're gonna try our best everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna send out the links here soon and
let's see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I have a bad connection,
but let's stop that for a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hash Church link.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we are live.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good to hear, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really thought this was gonna happen in
three years because next week is our three
[SPEAKER_10]: year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost thought, yeah, it's gonna be
choppy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be choppy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's gonna be very choppy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would say don't tell me how choppy it
is because if I see too many people
[SPEAKER_10]: posting how choppy it is, I'll stop and
I'll end church.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you guys want church to go into a
little bit of choppy, let's try our best.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, I'm on a computer that
guaranteed gonna fail me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I barely made the start of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today I thought I was hoping Natasha
today, but she's actually getting you as a
[SPEAKER_10]: moderator Etienne and helping out
sometimes when I'm just absolutely unable
[SPEAKER_10]: to pull it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I somehow pulled a scenario.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get to be a part of the
conversation today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or good evening.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are things there?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's excellent in the Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually quite a sunny day today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to have good weather in the
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_14]: So where are you in the world there?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Bubbleman?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hanging on Victoria, hanging on the island
today and just gonna sign in and say good
[SPEAKER_06]: morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is Karma Cup going, Mark?
[SPEAKER_10]: The Karma Cup is going very well.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a busy day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of people, lots of many people I
heard had done 10 and $15,000 in sales,
[SPEAKER_10]: us included.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of great people and lots of happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, this morning I was out front
waiting for my Uber to come pick up the to
[SPEAKER_10]: go do Hash Church and I saw Josh and he
was coming out just because people,
[SPEAKER_10]: police.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, what, you guys are worried
about the police?
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, yeah, they just announced
yesterday that the police have 240 million
[SPEAKER_10]: new dogs, illegal cannabis things in the
city of Toronto.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was about five or six cops up the
road.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it was the Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is more about the business of
dispensaries versus somehow controlled,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, I guess Ontario announced the
doing like LC, like liquor type stores,
[SPEAKER_10]: but for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're gonna do like 150 of them
around the province, anything like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can imagine, the majority of people
were not overly happy about it all.
[SPEAKER_10]: They should care if they open 150 shops to
sell weed to people.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you care about is being able to have
a dispenser and 50 new access points
[SPEAKER_10]: because hey, the more the merrier,
in my opinion, there is not enough places
[SPEAKER_10]: to buy great weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully out of these 150, there might
be, where are you at, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on the Malahat right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're just kind of hanging out here
and going over the stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's interesting to say what you're
saying there, Mark and what they're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: be doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember I listened to the whole 45
minute kind of little presentation they
[SPEAKER_06]: were talking about on the crackdowns and
how they're gonna start implementing a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole new system.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they say by 2020, they'll have 20
stores available within the first year or
[SPEAKER_06]: two.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how they plan on putting in
150 stores overnight and how that process
[SPEAKER_06]: is gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what's gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how many stores are gonna go?
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's an interesting way that
they're going about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems almost like they're going about
it the route of in the states here we have
[SPEAKER_14]: with things called ABC stores,
which before you had individual stores
[SPEAKER_14]: selling liquor, they have what's basically
a state store, which is basically owned by
[SPEAKER_14]: the state, that only holds state hours,
something like nine till like seven or
[SPEAKER_14]: something like that, where it's just only
place you could buy liquor back in the day
[SPEAKER_14]: until they actually had distribution and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, it just changed in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't buy a six pack of beer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just giving just a causality sort of
situation there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't buy beer on a Sunday in a
store.
[SPEAKER_14]: You would have to go to a bar to actually
get that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you pay for an individual beer if you
bought a six pack, you wouldn't buy just a
[SPEAKER_14]: regular six pack that you buy currently in
a store anywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I see why they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a tried and true model that has
worked with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can see why they're pushing in that
realm, but what negative effects is it
[SPEAKER_14]: going to, what immediate negative things
do you see?
[SPEAKER_14]: The negative?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess the negative effects that
we're looking at right now are going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: the people like our friends that are open
up dispensaries have spent their lives
[SPEAKER_06]: fighting for this plant and then
educating.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bud tenders and the knowledge behind
the people that they're helping,
[SPEAKER_06]: the patients that are being helped at
these dispensaries that we have,
[SPEAKER_06]: when they've established relationships
with the bud tenders and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these patients that have been
relying on these compassionate clubs who
[SPEAKER_06]: are compassionate, who do help,
who do give back, who do fund other
[SPEAKER_06]: events, who do support other people in the
industry who do give back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the liquor stores, it's not like they
give away free alcohol or they support
[SPEAKER_06]: groups or they put on big events and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different industry where the
cannabis industry is more supportive,
[SPEAKER_06]: where an alcohol industry is more about
money.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I was just looking at comparative
industries and how they're actually,
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to, please no one take this
as any way as alcohol in the same line as
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just looking at distribution models
and how they've gone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very frustrating when they've taken
this large overwhelming model,
[SPEAKER_14]: which of course is better for the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it leaves out all those that have
been spending decades busting their ass
[SPEAKER_14]: and risking their freedoms and challenging
local city as well as those federal laws
[SPEAKER_14]: there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you allow for LPs, it's rather
surprising they're going in this direction
[SPEAKER_14]: as opposed to letting the free market,
because they're allowing the free market
[SPEAKER_14]: to actually produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's surprising they're not going to allow
the free market to actually distribute it
[SPEAKER_14]: to Canadians.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I add something to this conversation?
[SPEAKER_14]: Always.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the line of the government's
trying to move in and like Johnny was
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, and take the jobs that have been
given to people that are actually caring
[SPEAKER_05]: about people and showing the compassion
and everything like that, that is all
[SPEAKER_05]: needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the support groups and all the support
that is at these compassion centers with
[SPEAKER_05]: the bud tenders, with people behind the
desk, with the people that are supplying
[SPEAKER_05]: those centers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now once we've got, once all of that is in
place, we don't have any of those bud
[SPEAKER_05]: tenders or any of those people putting any
of those special time, special needs into
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just simply go to the fucking
thing, grab your bottle, your bag,
[SPEAKER_05]: go to the counter, pay for it and leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now once that factor is taken away and
that personal factor has been taken away
[SPEAKER_05]: from everybody, not just guys that are
drinking booze or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: or shooting drugs or anything,
but everybody is going to, is not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: have that compassion or that level of
human being effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: People go into clubs and just talking to
somebody about what they've been smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's not the right thing for them
to be smoking because it's an indica or
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a sativa or if it's an indica,
sativa, hybrid dominance, whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're smoking the wrong stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not getting the right,
right, the right treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do they do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they go back to the internet,
research it up or go to the black
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace that has maybe a room in the
back?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a head shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's a, it's a hangout center,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's an arcade.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to bring other, they're
trying to bring this black market factor
[SPEAKER_05]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this black market is actually the
market that is helping everybody that is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm not saying the LPs aren't
helping people there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got nothing against anybody,
but this bullshit of everybody that's been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing this industry and part of this
industry and helping people and trying
[SPEAKER_05]: with people about the good things that are
happening and the bad things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, now we're going to have that whole
factor eliminated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then where do we go from there and
what happens to the patients?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the patients speak up?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want that back or what?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, why do you, why do you guys think
Canada has gone in this direction as
[SPEAKER_14]: opposed to as stated before, letting the
free market as, as it, it's created from
[SPEAKER_14]: the free market, you know, the whole,
you know, dispensary scene as it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So why do you think they've gone in this
direction?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Johnny, can you answer
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, pretty much what you're looking at
is you're looking at a system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're trying to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the biggest thing about Justin Trudeau
is talking about how they're getting rid
[SPEAKER_06]: of the, the black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So by them putting in all of these stores,
they got to open up distribution centers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I go into other places and other
friends that have like say multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: stores, they have distribution centers to
supply those stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're going to start seeing these
models as it's like I was talking with
[SPEAKER_06]: Darren.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, when I go to like a grocery
store, they have, it's like a distribution
[SPEAKER_06]: center for all the supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if I go to, uh, if no matter where we
go, we're always, we're getting more than
[SPEAKER_06]: one or two products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, back in the days, you know,
when I go see my buddy, he'd have one type
[SPEAKER_06]: of weed with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 10 different types of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the government has taken a look at
the dispensary model.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going to put in that type
of a system.
[SPEAKER_06]: How they're going to start hiring around
that will be interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's no schooling for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no education on how to prescribe
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to use pharmacists?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there's so many different things with
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as in for the people, the people have
the voice and, and I really see it like
[SPEAKER_06]: with prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we, we had, we had, there was harsh,
like laws that were enforced in the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as times grew, we started getting more
craft kind of breweries and stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not the same with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to see more of, uh, like the
independent grower who's got that certain
[SPEAKER_06]: strain, or they're going to have that
certain rosin or there'll be something
[SPEAKER_06]: that would be Tiki about every individual
that has their own little thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as the system changes,
I think the boutiques will fight hard
[SPEAKER_06]: enough in courts and cause this will turn
into a court battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we already know that Dana Larsen's
posting on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason, there's a lot of people already
talking about what things that we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: do as patients, as people, and as
Canadians to be able to ensure we get safe
[SPEAKER_06]: access.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, um, start a new
industry and we're going to weed a fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all about access.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, 150 stores in Ontario,
when I get off the planet, I can walk into
[SPEAKER_06]: a place and get, uh, what I need because I
need it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's access.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we've been fighting for.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you clarify more about what Dana
Larsen is saying that patients can do to,
[SPEAKER_14]: to get involved?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, I was just reading some
stuff he was putting on this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was going on here?
[SPEAKER_06]: The government wants to close dispensaries
and all black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make legal cannabis higher quality
and lower price than the dispensaries with
[SPEAKER_06]: a wider selection of high quality and
lower price extracts and edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's real legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the government is going to rely on the
race to shut down the current market,
[SPEAKER_06]: they will fail just like they failed for
the past century of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what Dana Larsen says 51
minutes ago on his Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, there's, you know, so,
so go look people if you're on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to Dana Larsen's page if you want to
learn more because, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's quite a few Canadians who
must be concerned at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: hearing this sort of situation that
especially those that actively run or
[SPEAKER_14]: dealing with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's always nerve wracking to hear
that your distribution access point could
[SPEAKER_14]: be, you know, shut down completely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that causes a great deal of anxiety to
people, you know, locally.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, it's very interesting,
um, situation there that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: Canada has gone in that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really just in the state of Ontario,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's the state of Ontario.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they looking to go national with it
as, as, as like the Ontario, they're,
[SPEAKER_14]: they're, um, sort of the incubation point
for this situation at this point?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny, are you listening to that?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Johnny froze up on us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's just where we are.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think about this, Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, have you heard about this,
uh, going on in Canada before?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm, I'm, what I'm for is that
individuals should be able to grow it as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as they want for their own use and
family use.
[SPEAKER_03]: For, if they want to sell it, I'm,
then, I'd like it to be taxed,
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated, and needed like an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if, uh, if dispensaries want to sell
it, if LPs want to sell it, if individuals
[SPEAKER_03]: want to sell it, as long as it's safe and
clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I, in my mind, I think tax is
regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we really want the marijuana
prohibition to be gone, dead, and buried,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we have to pay our part just like any
other industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is the reality that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've taken it past that idea of that,
what we always said, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: we wanted it legal or we want it taxed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is, um, part of those realities
that transpires that, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: we didn't, I mean, I guess some of us have
thought about, but, you know, the
[SPEAKER_14]: government's taken it further.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's very interesting to see,
you know, Canada go this direction for,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, really thought they would go the
dispensary model for some reason,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, allowing individuals.
[SPEAKER_14]: So do you think this will be like a Tweed
canopy distribution centers or Canadian
[SPEAKER_12]: distribution centers?
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think they will be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a clue, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what they're going to be,
but, well, you know what, then I think we
[SPEAKER_14]: should do a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome Dr. Sal down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's everyone doing today?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a little technical difficulty,
unfortunately with a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of running the show a bit
here today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we were talking about the new
distribution centers in Canada,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I was kind of curious about,
how's it going there in pencil?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know they've harvested the hemp and,
uh, they're working on, um, you're working
[SPEAKER_14]: on your growing distribution centers
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the status?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's, um, there's a,
uh, so again, the hemp is, is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, only experimental, uh, research plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're only allowed to grow
somewhere between three to five acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked a couple of the people,
um, who are involved to, uh, maybe be,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, panelists on upcoming hash church so
they can give us a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, uh, poop on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also, uh, medical licenses for
grower processors that have been awarded
[SPEAKER_00]: in Pennsylvania as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you know, groundbreaking
ceremonies to open facilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, you know, coming online and
happening in a neighboring state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland too, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, there's, uh,
every day, every week, there's more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more progress being made on establishing
programs in these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a positive movement and movement
forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's what we all want to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's one thing to hear,
you know, states move saying they're going
[SPEAKER_14]: to do something.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's another thing that actually
transpire.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, it's very positive for
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know, um, when you, what,
approximately when Pennsylvanians look at
[SPEAKER_14]: having actual distribution centers to go
purchase cannabis at?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the, uh, facilities are just,
you know, uh, in the process of starting
[SPEAKER_00]: up right now, doctors are being trained
because they have to go through some,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mandatory training in order to be able
to have the, the ability to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're trying to, again, increase
the, uh, education of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals so they can understand what
are the right conditions that they should,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, look for to prescribe
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, there's a clinical
applicants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are applicants that are
associated with large research
[SPEAKER_00]: universities that have hospitals and,
um, um, associated with a group that's
[SPEAKER_00]: working with the Thomas Jefferson
university in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is, again, I guess the notion
is that they're going to do a lot of sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of outpatient open ended clinical type
research to try to develop some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of, uh, clinical efficacy
amongst patient population groups by,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, by volunteering, you know,
so, so a patient that would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular medical condition would
basically, uh, volunteer, uh, some
[SPEAKER_00]: information through a medical
questionnaire on how effective a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular strain or product or oil or
tincture is, and be able to develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, information and databases based
on, you know, real patient experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have, uh, patients lined up or is
there a way that people could get involved
[SPEAKER_14]: if they wanted to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is, you know, you know,
building the plane while you're flying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all happening while it's the,
I think the legislation is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's new about it that,
you know, universities haven't done this
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, it's a, it's a big new
unknown thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, not yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are the universities embracing it or are
they still kinds of at arm's length with
[SPEAKER_14]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting because the
Pennsylvania Medical Society is now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sort of looking at it and it's
established like best practices and rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, as is the, uh, Pennsylvania Bar
Association, again, giving guidance to
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys because, um, if it's,
you know, if something's federally against
[SPEAKER_00]: the law, theoretically, an attorney can't
give you any information to help you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, break federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's always been sort of a
quandary for attorneys because they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: advise, um, you know, and play the
necessary roles that legal, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: folks and attorneys play in the startup of
new businesses and be able to give clients
[SPEAKER_00]: advice in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This business world has been always a
tricky thing for attorneys because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, um, they can be disbarred for
giving, uh, information that can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: their clients, uh, breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you read that, uh, as that they
can't give help to anyone in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, it's useful for the Pennsylvania
Bar Association and all the other state
[SPEAKER_00]: bar associations to establish a set of
rules and guidelines that attorneys can
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Pennsylvania Medical Association
has done the same thing for physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, it's giving the legitimate,
the legitimacy of having a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: standards and a set of code of ethics that
this is how you apply this for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for this patient population or in the case
of attorneys for, you know, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects that they, they interact on,
you know, business development and
[SPEAKER_00]: securing contracts and everything that
attorneys need to do to be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, see this industry, you know,
become established.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a huge step in the direction of
allowing, you know, the market to,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, to rain, you know, it's key that
they're allowing this type of,
[SPEAKER_14]: um, discussion at those points because
those are key.
[SPEAKER_14]: Any of the type of business people are
going to need counseling and, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: you're in the Commonwealth.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, Pennsylvania, as the
Commonwealth, it's interesting to see how
[SPEAKER_14]: that shall all shake out for equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a Commonwealth, I don't think we can
pass stuff by referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, Colorado and Oregon,
like a lot of these states that have voted
[SPEAKER_00]: in things, it's been voted in by public
referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for some reason goes back to
the 1600s or William Penn days.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a Commonwealth, you can't vote in stuff
by referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, you know, I guess the,
uh, the legislature's know best,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's just, it's how it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what's happening here in California.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we passed our laws, but now they
get ahold of it because they now have to
[SPEAKER_14]: regulate it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but, uh, I wonder how long before
we'll see the LTP tax on cannabis because
[SPEAKER_14]: it's going to come in time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, people don't know every can of
soda and anything that goes through
[SPEAKER_14]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_14]: And once state, you know, I guess
interstate commerce is allowed,
[SPEAKER_14]: that will finally take place.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, I know that, uh, you know,
Pennsylvania does well off that taxation
[SPEAKER_14]: off of things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's been a lot of, there's been
a lot of talk about the privatization of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, of that state run liquor authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and actually I think like in
Washington state, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sometimes it's the liquor control
board that ends up taking the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating cannabis in the, in the new
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess they figure, well,
these people sold booze, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: or regulated, regulated the selling of
booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must be good at regulating the sell
of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about it, if the state
wanted to have dispensaries or state owned
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings and facilities, they already
have a network and a distribution network
[SPEAKER_00]: within the state to get a controlled
dangerous substance to a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: place for.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was talking about that before you came
on the ABC stores, because when I was in
[SPEAKER_14]: Louisiana, when I grew up, but they didn't
have ABC stores, I could go to a seven 11
[SPEAKER_14]: and pick up a pint or up to a fifth of
Jack Daniels or beer, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_14]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas when I went to West Virginia,
I learned that they, and in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_14]: back in the day, they had state stores.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, you already have that
distribution.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's actually happening in Canada and
Darren and, um, and, uh, the other
[SPEAKER_14]: Canadians were making us aware of what's
actually, uh, transpiring up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it made me immediately think of
Pennsylvania because, uh, and,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, in West Virginia, because it was
such a foreign idea to me, but now as a
[SPEAKER_14]: distribution set up for the state,
I get it and understand why it is that it
[SPEAKER_14]: is, but that model of course seems to have
become outdated over time and they've
[SPEAKER_14]: allowed the free market to finally,
you know, rain.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, how long did it take for
Pennsylvania to come around?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, only what last year did it pass
regarding buying a six pack on a Sunday?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: At a bar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, it's to take that long for
that type of change.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's interesting to see what each state
is going to do, but I would rather
[SPEAKER_14]: surprised by Canada taking this turn of
going to that sort of ABC set up as
[SPEAKER_14]: opposed to letting the free market,
uh, access or those that have spent years
[SPEAKER_14]: as activists risking their freedoms,
et cetera, you know, pushing things,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, pushing the agenda forward and
being allowed to be players in the,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the new world as opposed to
being shut out and excluded that it looks
[SPEAKER_14]: to Canada is doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think Canada is going to go in that
direction or, I mean, pardon me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think Pennsylvania is going to go
in that direction like the ABC stores for
[SPEAKER_14]: initiality or do you think it will allow
the free market to go in that direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it sounds like it's going to
be free market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that's the way they're
going to go at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, there's a large number of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lesser number of grower
processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, and some of those grower
processors have their own dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a wholesale market
between the grower processors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dispensers are sort of, um,
the licenses were given out, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to population centers and
basically where people live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in the Philadelphia region
and in the Pittsburgh region and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Harrisburg Scranton areas, the areas where
there's heavy population, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: awarded more licenses in the area,
but the grower processors are distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the state and it's kind of like
a, uh, six sections divvied up state kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, we'll see because the
clinical applicants to the clinical folks
[SPEAKER_00]: can also sell, I think, into the wholesale
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, um, uh, clinical licenses are also
going to be, uh, you know, valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excited to see what happens there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have an opportunity there to really
show the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one real, I guess, advantage in
Pennsylvania is, um, well, I won't say
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's kind of like a rare thing is
autism is a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know, I've heard
numbers like one in five people are
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere on the autistic spectrum or
autism spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the fact that autism is a qualifying
condition is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that means the patient count,
um, for at least that condition could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be, you know, in the millions
without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I don't, I'm, you know,
again, I've, I've heard some stories about
[SPEAKER_00]: the effectiveness of cannabis,
um, with autism and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like Asperger's or Tourette's
neurological disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm not really sure that again,
there's a sort of one size fits all
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to how, um, how effective
cannabis is for autism.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I know it helps me focus,
uh, whenever I'm in situations or
[SPEAKER_14]: stressful situations where other people
were like, I don't know, I can smoke
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis and that helps me, uh,
you know, in those types of situations.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I am one of those, we're, we're some
of the rare ones on here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who can fully function while, you know,
you know, on cannabis, whereas we've all
[SPEAKER_14]: come across people who can't,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and that, that's, you know,
just nor here nor there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, pencil, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are some stories of,
again, people, I mean, uh, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing autistic, uh, patients alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, completely like people talking for
the first time, putting sentences
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, uh, they've lived in a very,
you know, different world before they
[SPEAKER_00]: started being treated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, again, I'm not exactly
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think autism is kind of a manifestation
of several potential neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and they may not all be the
same, but certainly, uh, given the
[SPEAKER_00]: surveillance of the CB1 receptor in the
human brain, you would think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, cannabis would, would have some
impact on, on, on what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's related to the same way
that it works with epilepsy, but you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that, again, there's, there's some kind of
magic combination of using cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to nourish to give good
endocannabinoid response.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maybe some of these conditions that
lead to seizures and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's been known as the tree of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it brings, you know,
wisdom to those who, who imbibe in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: I've read that in history books regarding
hash and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure lots of people consider it the
tree of knowledge and tree of wisdom and
[SPEAKER_03]: tree of medicine and tree of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all different kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Touche.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm talking through history.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've actually read, you know, manuscripts
and things like that, that, that seem to
[SPEAKER_14]: reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, I definitely, doctor, I definitely
see there's aspects of cannabis bringing,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, affecting, you know,
but of course it also depends on what
[SPEAKER_14]: strain one genetic to that individual.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's the thing we also have to
work on as well as to find those,
[SPEAKER_14]: those combinations that work.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, we know it's individualistic,
you know, it's very hard to come up with a
[SPEAKER_14]: swath recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has started on cannabinoids for the last
couple of decades, but now we're starting
[SPEAKER_03]: to focus on not only single or combination
cannabinoid sweets in a particular
[SPEAKER_03]: profile, but the terpene that goes along
with it or terpenes I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, the amount of different profiles
that can be presented from just 150
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes and some hundred cannabinoids is
already hundreds of thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you consider that you can alter
the profiles just by increasing one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those terpenes or two of them or three,
there's an infinite variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we all know from practical use of
cannabis for decades, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: each cannabis batch you get is a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is mostly just THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the past, not the future
where we've got a lot of CBD and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to get other things out there
too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're definitely looking at,
you know, new aspects without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those ratios have, you know, always
altered and that's kind of always been the
[SPEAKER_14]: frustration of some patients when they
finally find something that works for them
[SPEAKER_14]: is that works for that batch.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the next batch that comes
through, it's either slightly altered in
[SPEAKER_14]: one way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's definitely, you know,
how it's grown, how it's maintained,
[SPEAKER_14]: how it's harvested, all those things and
consistency all the way through are one of
[SPEAKER_14]: the most important things to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the reasons why Bedrikan is so
successful with the Dutch government
[SPEAKER_14]: because they just grow consistently and
they get consistent results, which is not
[SPEAKER_03]: only does Bedrikan do that, but once they
start flowering in the room, they have no
[SPEAKER_03]: entrance by human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's untouched by human hands.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was one of the most interesting
things when I was there to actually see
[SPEAKER_14]: one, how far the lights were from the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_14]: For one, they put them in because I saw a
room that they just put the plants in and
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw rooms with full canopy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, to see the evenness of the
canopy was, that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was nice to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't usually see that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But to see that the room were completely
sealed and no one goes in once they're
[SPEAKER_14]: flowered was something and a concept I
have never heard of, much less seen in
[SPEAKER_14]: application to see it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing it for decades,
haven't patented.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called untouched by human hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we did use monkeys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Harvesting monkeys or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, special harvesting monkeys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or beneficial monkeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents were coconut monkeys that
would twist the coconuts, but these guys
[SPEAKER_03]: twist the buds off.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you train them by monkeys, see a monkey
do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my advanced apiary.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's the only that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've ever seen is a bedrock can do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've not seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had such a silly thing in my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was rather surprising and to see some
of the problems that happened in there on
[SPEAKER_14]: the floor, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: I photographed that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what happens in the ceilings and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was rather surprised by that grow
altogether.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fascinating to see them locking
that all in.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't recommend that, people.
[SPEAKER_14]: So don't lock your things in a room and
walk away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing they do which may or may
not be beneficial for some people,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I doubt for everybody, is they gamma
ray nuke it and sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that reduces the terpenes up to 30%.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know after seeing that facility why
they do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get rid of the traces of robots that
they're using.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know they should transfer over to
monkeys apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fair to the monkeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is because I let them keep half
the hash they collected on their face.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam, did the monkeys eat cannabis when you
were in India?
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see them eat or attack the plants
or the hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: I never saw it, but not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the reason might be that when you
eat a plant, it's mostly THC-A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to have very little of
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, it'll just pass through the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other animals, yes, I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I've heard of birds and other
animals.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had deer eat plants in Pennsylvania
that I grew back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, I've seen wood rats just
strip the bark off the plants because they
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted it for nests.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, so they literally redded the plant
alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it wasn't healthy for the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Early growing, we've always had to put
mesh screens over the plants to make sure
[SPEAKER_14]: rats or any small rodents don't want to
munch on the little tender shoots.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had literally 41 out of 42 plants eaten
by deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that pre-flowering or after flowering?
[SPEAKER_14]: After flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they'll eat the leaves and stuff
for the moisture because they can't find
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_14]: The plants were destroyed.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could tell it was chewed because they
were still hanging on the plants,
[SPEAKER_14]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there were lay marks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, they must have come through as
a group and just got their game on and
[SPEAKER_14]: then crashed and moved on.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, there was lay marks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it was biker deer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was whitetail.
[SPEAKER_14]: In Pennsylvania, they have whitetail.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have mule deer like out here in
the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, deer are a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think wood rats might even be worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in a civilized area,
gophers.
[SPEAKER_14]: People have been having problems out here
with sudden oak death attacking cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what just happens is their plants just
die and they can't figure out why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not familiar or seen problems with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really comment.
[SPEAKER_14]: It causes the mushiness of the cellulose
and it destroys any type of movement of
[SPEAKER_14]: fluid.
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically, it causes a mushiness right
as the roots and the stalk separate right
[SPEAKER_14]: in there and the plants just literally
collapse.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's under their own weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it airborne or soil-borne?
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to be airborne.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a friend of mine who grows in the
Central Valley and last year, he lost his
[SPEAKER_14]: entire crop in greenhouse due to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's becoming his entire greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: So actually, it was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't last year because he got a
successful crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he actually get it identified?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, because he's a fourth generation
farmer in Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he knows what he's doing and has access
to testers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew in the Central Valley for a decade.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a recent phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a type of rod that is sudden oak
death has kind of appeared in the last
[SPEAKER_14]: five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a main problem here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up in Oakland because there's an
Oakland oak and they're trying to preserve
[SPEAKER_14]: it as best as they can.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've been susceptible to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an Oakland oak in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an Oakland oak actually outside my
window in front of me here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I keep an eye on them all the time and
they've been without any problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's been, unfortunately, throughout
California and moving up and around the
[SPEAKER_14]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a drag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like oak trees because if you look,
you can find chanterelles.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up in Louisiana with huge live
oaks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to play on live oaks almost the
size of some of these sequoias in
[SPEAKER_14]: diameter, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's Evangeline oaks,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've always had a fondness for them and
how deep their roots are.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was rather surprised how shallow the
roots are of the sequoias here in
[SPEAKER_14]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really well known for having such
shallow roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they make up for it in age and size
and girth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, as well as being fireproof.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, fire resistant as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people I know who use redwoods on
their houses out here in California for
[SPEAKER_14]: that type of fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also insect resistant in houses.
[SPEAKER_14]: That as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, there's a lot of problems right
now out here in California and throughout
[SPEAKER_14]: the West because everything's on fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, up there, Darren, up there in B
.C.
[SPEAKER_14]: and stuff, it's all, you know,
the fires are going.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know a lot of outdoor people are
upset because their crops are being ashed
[SPEAKER_14]: on as well as, you know, those
particulates that are burning or falling
[SPEAKER_14]: and, you know, gutting into the,
you know, your crystals and everything on
[SPEAKER_14]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can't wash that sort of thing off.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's causing a lot of problems for
people literally from California to
[SPEAKER_14]: Missouri right now that are growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we feel for you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Any suggestions, Sam, of what people could
do regarding if they're in fallout areas
[SPEAKER_14]: of a fire as best as they can do to
protect the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I mean, if you're inside of a
greenhouse or a building, you could try to
[SPEAKER_03]: filter the air that comes in that you're
supplying your plants to so you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: spreading any contaminants to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would protect them if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in a greenhouse, it can be harder
if you're because most greenhouses have
[SPEAKER_03]: open ventilation up on the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, and outdoors, what the hell can
you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I honestly, honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe pray the fires go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, isn't it like any other natural
disaster areas?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically fucking taken as it comes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a fucked up crop, it's a
fucked up crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if the ass will do the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if the hail comes or a flood comes
or hurricane comes, you lose your crop and
[SPEAKER_03]: you grow again next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my buddy up north, he had a
hailstorm just tear through parts of
[SPEAKER_05]: Puskupe, is the town called.
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be a thousand people living
there, five hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how much?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a hailstorm hit so hard that it
killed my buddy's whole garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smashed, it smashed sunroofs out of
houses, windows out of houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: His 19, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: 1970 GMC pickup mint condition 70 pickup
smashed and dented.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, like like someone went around with
golf balls, golf ball hammer and smashed
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere on the truck smash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Windows wreaked havoc like house
insurance.
[SPEAKER_05]: The siding on his house smashed garden
destroyed everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a natural disaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, nature was mad and she laid her
fucking havoc across the land.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was that pick up and move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the shitty part.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the same with our deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure in Vancouver also,
it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a before there was man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature had a natural cycle, but there
would be a lot of.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lightning would hit something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just repeated over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they've just they've realized that
as I go to national parks all the time,
[SPEAKER_14]: they finally realized, as opposed to
trying to control these fires,
[SPEAKER_14]: that it's best to just let them go because
it's they've realized after all these
[SPEAKER_14]: years of conservation that it's really the
best thing that they can do is allow
[SPEAKER_14]: nature to do what it does, because that
type of burning clears the brush and
[SPEAKER_14]: clears all the undergrowth.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they've also realized to stop doing
that so much in recent history and just
[SPEAKER_14]: allowing those houses to burn as opposed
to they still try to save them as they
[SPEAKER_14]: can.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, there's pine cones that,
you know, are triggered by fires when they
[SPEAKER_14]: come through.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they release, you know, their seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a whole ecosystem structure to,
you know, these fires that they've now
[SPEAKER_14]: come to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a fire, there's new life.
[SPEAKER_03]: New life.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fires create it as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't for the fire, it would not
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those seeds wouldn't sprout or do anything
without the fire from those pine cones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what germinates them or activates
them or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's also why you don't have those
types of old growth forests, because you
[SPEAKER_14]: don't have that type of undergrowth.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were talking last week about old growth
forests, and there's things about old
[SPEAKER_14]: growth forests, all the different layers
of canopy and floor that are there that
[SPEAKER_14]: exist that, you know, they don't exist out
here in the West because of fires and how
[SPEAKER_14]: they come through and they clear all that
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, natural selection becomes
the winner of the day out here in the
[SPEAKER_14]: Sierras, you know, or all the way up into
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those big areas up in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where the Sequoias are, they had small
fires go through there every 10,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20, 50, whatever years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Sequoias were there for a couple
thousand, and most of them did just fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's very interesting to see out in
the Sierras right now because of the
[SPEAKER_14]: fires.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we send our best to those that are out
there doing the dirty work and the fire
[SPEAKER_14]: jumpers and the firefighters.
[SPEAKER_14]: That are protecting people's houses and
everything right now because they're doing
[SPEAKER_14]: work that definitely needs to be done,
and we respect what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that stuff's crazy because I know a
lot of people rely on their hard work and
[SPEAKER_14]: dedication.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to send a bong rip out to
those hardworking individuals who are
[SPEAKER_14]: trying to save other people's lives
selflessly.
[SPEAKER_14]: So shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, can we get a bong rip there,
Darren?
What
[SPEAKER_14]: are you smoking on, Sam?
Tangy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You like the Tangy a lot lately,
huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: Or that's just a lot that you have around?
[SPEAKER_14]: Both.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tangy is very popular out here in
California right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, they're mixing that with
now everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you've got all kinds of different
strains coming out from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So which, of course, comes from the Calio.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, so it's interesting to see all
these different... Sounds good,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: People should try to get not only the
taste they like, but the effects they
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would also suggest in the strength
they prefer because you can smoke smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts to adjust strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's nice if you can get what...
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now I'm smoking some fresh off the
bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good guy out of Cal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some OG lemonade, live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh off the bud, huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, it's... I want to start
competing with this company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start one called Fresh From
the Bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking some West Coast Concentrates,
Bubble Hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: What flavor there, D?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: P.K.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Kushes are popular.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Asa.
[SPEAKER_05]: A while ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Heard of any new strains out in Amsterdam
there, Sam?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you're not even looking?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sort of semi-retired and not
really very active.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hear about them when people bring to
my attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not out there looking like I used
to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you used to have your finger on the
pulse always.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I was asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now there's just these multipoly
complex hybrids that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're so complicated, their genetic
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody just takes really, really,
really good female clones and crosses them
[SPEAKER_03]: with other really, really, really good
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems to be the fastest way to
achieve something that's probably going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we live in definitely a very poly
world.
[SPEAKER_14]: What was interesting to see, I would love
to... When we originally were doing
[SPEAKER_14]: testing, it was so interesting to see how
very close in ratios, of course,
[SPEAKER_14]: all these cannabis were.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that 96% of them all had very
similar profiles of THC to other ratios.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we didn't really have terpene testing
originally.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd love to see that in comparison,
because, you know, that's the difference
[SPEAKER_14]: between each one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because even when you grow 100
plants from some modern polymulti-complex
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid, you grow 100 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The odds are, you're not just one
expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get a diverse selection of
expression.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the fun part, selecting and
finding out which one of those is the
[SPEAKER_14]: reigning champ, you know, because it's
usually just gone off of vigor,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, or, you know, how fast it grew,
its strength, its overall health,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, as opposed to growing out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, have you ever... Did you ever grow
out every hundred one of those and try
[SPEAKER_14]: every single hundred of them to figure out
which profile was best?
[SPEAKER_14]: Or what did you do for your selection,
just off of smell, taste?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in the beginning, I used how
vigorous that was, because if it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: vigorous, I wasn't so interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also smell, flavor, resin production,
flower-to-leaf ratio, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: really important things like the effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were all shaped by your palate,
because you even said you went toward the
[SPEAKER_14]: more sweeter as opposed to the more of the
savior.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was also selecting not just for
myself, but yes, in general, I used my
[SPEAKER_03]: values, the judgements, yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's all kinds of strains that
have been lost that are of different,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, flavor profiles that,
you know, and this is just the reality of
[SPEAKER_14]: just, you know, farming, as you were
saying, you know, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you have the genes for that
cannabinoid, which I don't see that as a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, they're all out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you have the genes for the
particular terpene synthase, there's only
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 that we've ID'd in cannabis so far,
then you can breed any chemical profile
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of a particular cannabinoid
profile matched with the particular
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of doing the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things like patient surveys,
like you were talking about, that gives a
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of feedback for what particular group
of cannabinoid or cannabinoids work best
[SPEAKER_03]: with which terpenes for which medical
educations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once that information is available,
then breeders can target that combination.
[SPEAKER_14]: So start your germination, people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get your seeds going.
[SPEAKER_14]: Find those genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: Find what works.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all have different flavors and we all
have different flavor tastes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm excited to see what's going to
happen when these, you know, with these
[SPEAKER_14]: legal markets and as these different type
of aspects of genetics come online of,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, this next generation that puts
forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited to see over the horizon,
cannabis wise, because it's going to go
[SPEAKER_14]: all kinds of different directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only from the different states,
but also from, you know, different
[SPEAKER_03]: international countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait till it's legal worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like buying a bottle of wine
from which you can count from 100 to 150
[SPEAKER_03]: to 50 different countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'd love to order my Durban from South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, various other genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: But as well, Sam, though, I mean,
how many of these old world genetics are
[SPEAKER_14]: still out there that are being,
you know, I mean, there's small aspects in
[SPEAKER_14]: the world they're still patches of,
but I'd say the best chance to find some
[SPEAKER_03]: pure, for example, Durban, South Africa,
African genetics would be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've got some, but I'm sure there
are people there and they can grow it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the best way for that area so that they
can produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, it'll, it'll be like
boutique cannabis produced for export,
[SPEAKER_03]: not like where it used to be, but way
better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they've been growing it already
for generations.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they already know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Traditional genetics.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, I'm curious as to how much of
those traditional genetics are still out
[SPEAKER_14]: there, because we know that the world's
been flood with these quasi Euro Cali
[SPEAKER_14]: genetics from the past decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until cannabis is really legal,
we can't answer that because nobody knows
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that has to be that research and that
gene mapping to actually break that all
[SPEAKER_14]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst obvious examples of what you're
talking about is Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica, Morocco, those three,
they're so flooded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can find any untouched
land race genetics from those three
[SPEAKER_03]: countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unless somebody took it and has it,
but what about Thailand or Indonesia
[SPEAKER_14]: somewhere like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think it's as bad,
but probably the worst actually is Morocco
[SPEAKER_03]: because in Morocco, they don't call males.
[SPEAKER_03]: They allow males to pollinate because they
produce hashish and all of it is seeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means any male introduction gets
spread through the community within a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years to everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first generation, it's pure male
pollen from an imported genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second year, there's thousands of
plants that are half that foreign genetic,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the third generation, there's millions
of plants that are a quarter of that
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets through the whole population.
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt you can find untouched land races
in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be logical, but you could.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't seem like it would be so.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same way for people who always
ask when I go to Maui, it's like,
[SPEAKER_14]: do you ever see real Maui?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there ever was real Maui.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it was, it's been eradicated a long
time ago from the helicopters and
[SPEAKER_14]: harassment.
[SPEAKER_14]: So all that's there is what's brought to
the islands.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just the reality of the situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's a lot of commercial
production except for medical in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be, but there was enough
marijuana that Hawaii wasn't a sport in
[SPEAKER_03]: the late 60s, early 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were exporting, but yeah,
it's reversed, and they're an importing
[SPEAKER_03]: country, an importing area.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it so they can sell it to the
tourists.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, everybody, I know that was local
before the medical that they have growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just grows in very small one,
two outdoor tops and a couple plants
[SPEAKER_14]: indoor tops because they have to,
discretion is key.
[SPEAKER_14]: They still fly helicopters or the
government still gives them money.
[SPEAKER_03]: To grow it legally in Hawaii, you give
them your GPS address.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're allowed to grow five plants or
something, you have to tell them the
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, correct, now.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that there's, when I go in
December, I hope to check out the facility
[SPEAKER_14]: there in Maui because they're producing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think they already had just a short
production run and they already ran out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's one of those initial situations
that we've seen where when you've got
[SPEAKER_14]: vertically integrated setups like that,
that it takes time for the grow to catch
[SPEAKER_14]: up to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's definitely, they're going through
that growing pain as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I used to, in the early 70s,
I thought Hawaiian, and the reason was
[SPEAKER_03]: because they were using narrowly drug
genetics in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some of the really, really,
really interesting psychedelic trippy type
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's cannabis that again,
that was brought to the island.
[SPEAKER_14]: There doesn't seem to be any type.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was not Hawaiian varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they were grown in Hawaii by people
who had been on the hash trail and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: And pretty much any cannabis from Maui was
just called Maui Waui, correct?
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't necessarily a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not be surprised if that was true
for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's the rumor I've been told
because again, they were growing,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I have artist renditions.
[SPEAKER_14]: I even have one here for artist thing for
Maui Gold, you know, Maui's finest
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis grown on Mount Haleakala.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's, hold on here, it's being brought
over.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just, it's from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a, it's just one of those,
it's a print.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, that's one of those crazy things.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine cannabis at a popular price.
[SPEAKER_14]: Harvested them on slopes of Haleakala.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they just, it was more of just
advertising and just things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't any type of specific genetic
from even people that I've talked to,
[SPEAKER_14]: they would just, as you stated Sam,
they were long leaf equatorial genetics
[SPEAKER_14]: that were brought to the islands and grown
apparently very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: It grew, you know, those equatorials
apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they're resistant to the
kind of problems that you get in a wet,
[SPEAKER_03]: hot, short photo period environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure a lot of them did super nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: And how would you rate the quality of that
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you had tried some of that Maui back
in the day, yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, no, I thought some of it was
almost as good as the Hayes, almost as
[SPEAKER_03]: good as the best Thai sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time I saw Thai sticks,
I didn't believe that was actually
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've seen people grow Hayes and
Hayes hybrids in Hawaii too that came out
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want to grow super big giant
plants because they didn't want thieves to
[SPEAKER_03]: see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't afraid of the police because
they were legal under that program,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they could only grow, I think it was
five plants or something, but they thought
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality came out super nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, here's somebody, they want to see this
again, the Maui gold.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got this in, um, isn't that Einstein
smoking that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Einstein holding a pipe, which if he
was, you know, tobacco pipe, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_14]: it was definitely, I picked that up,
uh, 10 years ago and Maui and paella.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would know Einstein went to Maui.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it was his place to hang out
over the guilt of the, the, the atomic
[SPEAKER_14]: bomb, I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think he's ever been there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But of course somebody will produce a
picture of him in Hawaii and a,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, with a lay around his neck and
some Bermuda shorts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I've still stunned over your bone pipe
last week there, Sam, I have to say that
[SPEAKER_14]: was definitely the mic drop of the month
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen quite a few people who have the
very top half of a human skull and they
[SPEAKER_03]: use it for, you know, when you break up
buds, you make a joint with hash and weed
[SPEAKER_03]: or with hash and tobacco as some Europeans
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have like a little hash bowl that
they use.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: They use a, they use a human skull as a
rolling tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's a rolling bowl.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, you know, that, that, that's some
Hunter S.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thompson in his briefcase sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were all not either in Nepal
or Tibet.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen, uh, Tibetan monks that have
the, you know, the knuckle necklaces that
[SPEAKER_14]: are carved into little skulls.
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually take the knuckles from the
dead monks and actually carve them into
[SPEAKER_14]: skulls and make them into, I guess,
kind of prayer beads.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess you've seen that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that kind of stuff when I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, I like the Nepali people and,
uh, the Tibetan people, I, I, I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_14]: It had to be kind of cultural,
you know, submersion that you were in and
[SPEAKER_03]: to look around and see all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tibetans I was dealing with were in
Ladakh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is what, what, what's commonly
called Indian Tibet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, China got most of Tibet,
but part of Tibet was, uh, the Indians
[SPEAKER_03]: took control of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the capital city is Lei and it's
Ladakh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, it was very, very Tibetan
when me and my wife went there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I've heard there's more and more
and more Indian business people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, moving up there to control the
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of tourists, unbelievable
place if you ever get a chance to visit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but don't, don't go if you are expecting a
lot of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they've got is just age old
tradition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tibetan and it's not screwed over the
way it has been in China by, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, China would say to, uh, you know,
modern world and, uh, Tibetan someone
[SPEAKER_03]: might disagree.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_14]: How we doing over here?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're, I see you in chat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm enjoying.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard because I've got a bit of a
choppy connection, but, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: dude, you guys are safe in the day for
sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've, uh, I've eventually got to get back
to the event here, but, uh, I want to stay
[SPEAKER_10]: as long as I can and hang out and listen
to church.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can see you now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to nominate new Pope of past
church.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I say long live Ed Chen and,
uh, uh, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he can't be here, that's the way it
goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't claim any type of Pope to dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bunger.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Outstanding.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even have my D-nail here up and I
have no way of puffing for hash church.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll just, uh, I'll just go for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will puff one in your honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll blow it right in your direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't be blowing it in the road.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's play a little catch up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I told you guys this
already or not.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was you saying something?
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is my catch catch captured a bird
today or last night sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I come up in the hallway and there's
some feathers on the floor and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can catch another bird in here to
eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for the carcass and there's no
carcass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thinking they ate the whole thing
and there's just the feathers left over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple hours later, I'm looking on my
windowsill in the kitchen, getting a drink
[SPEAKER_05]: for making my coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a little bird on my window.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hiding behind the vitamins.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I grabbed the towel and I grabbed this,
I put it over the thing and I moved the
[SPEAKER_05]: vitamins out so delicately, so nicely.
[SPEAKER_05]: They saved this little bird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can feel his little heartbeat just
pounding away in the cloth and the towel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring them outside halfway down my
driveway to the tail end of my truck and I
[SPEAKER_05]: put them on the back of the truck and the
little shit fucking flies directly back
[SPEAKER_05]: into the fucking house and goes and hides
behind the couch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you're free, man.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I can't find them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get them on from under the couch
and the cats are going to probably eat
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mother nature is running its course
once again in my living room.
[SPEAKER_14]: Natural selection happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to save it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was safe right back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you got to close the door
behind you when you go outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first thing I thought of,
but I just, I just had him in the towel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to get him out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That reminds me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a man that reminds me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember I was like 11 years old and I
caught us caught a garter snake and it was
[SPEAKER_14]: wrapped around my arm and I brought it
into the kitchen and my mom was asleep and
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm, I get it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a jar and I got its tail in and I
tried to throw his head down and then put
[SPEAKER_13]: the cap on and it just springs straight
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of the jar goes right behind everything on
the counter and I'm just frantically,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, looking for it.
[SPEAKER_13]: As I just grab it, I turn around and
there's my mom with her arms on her head.
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell are you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, Oh, I have a snake in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought a stake in the, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you should have said was you found
a snake in your house and you wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your mom wouldn't get upset.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't that bright in the moment back
then.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was, I was a deer in the headlights.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, ah, I was a good little
Catholic boy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I confessed immediately.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was, yeah, I learned to lie later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew you couldn't last without us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the picture of a bubble band.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks like he's pointing his
finger down at you saying, don't tell
[SPEAKER_03]: lies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I learned that a lot, you know,
uh, you know, in my adulthood,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, don't lie.
[SPEAKER_14]: That way you don't have to cover up your
own tracks.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to remember what you said.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, uh, it's one of those life
lessons, you know, there's little white
[SPEAKER_14]: lies sometimes you have to say in life,
but you know, sometimes I think in the
[SPEAKER_03]: short term lies are better or easier,
but in the long run, the truth is.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: You gotta always play the long game in
that resolve.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you're only selling yourself
short.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, who the hell wants to be deceived?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how lame is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just deceive our friends and the
people.
[SPEAKER_14]: The American public apparently like it
because look what we keep electing,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, we keep electing fools.
[SPEAKER_03]: People go to Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it for?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it for?
[SPEAKER_03]: To be deceived.
[SPEAKER_12]: You mean that's not really the Eiffel
tower.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're on mute there, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_14]: That pen looks really good, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's it working?
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta say, you jam like a ridiculous
amount of terpenes into like any type of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoid mixture and inhale it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's generally going to taste pretty
awful.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we sold out of the pens and the
cartridges today and yesterday,
[SPEAKER_10]: so it's been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friends actually,
[SPEAKER_10]: and then they filled them up with rosin,
so we were actually selling rosin filled
[SPEAKER_10]: pens at my booth, but really it was them
selling rosin filled pens, but I just like
[SPEAKER_10]: to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like watching people come up and you
know, I'd watch them like get it going and
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of teach them how to use it and that
was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta get hold of Tony.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got one for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta try it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks too good to have two.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like finally one that will work
for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think you're in for some luck
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he has the California smoothie for
you, which is like strawberry banana goo
[SPEAKER_10]: mixed with.
[SPEAKER_14]: The climate is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God, my tongue will be so confused
by flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's worse things.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not worried about you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I do appreciate, I know it's a
little choppy for me here and it was a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit rough to try and get a church
going, but even if we can pull off a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple of hours, I'm super stoked,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do appreciate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful email the other day and I meant
to reply to you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just been traveling and I've been
busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I read it on my phone when I landed
actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also love to have you here on
HashChurchBud.
[SPEAKER_10]: As often as we can.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi and welcome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus, who's going to be our special
guest for next week?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can think of all kinds of
people, but who's making the promise to
[SPEAKER_03]: show?
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't really asked too many people,
but I'll probably send out an email today
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's going to be a very long email
list.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, I would ask you guys as well,
if you can compile any emails or contact
[SPEAKER_10]: info for people that have been on the
show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to invite Jessica back.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to invite Samantha Elvie back.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get like, you know, put an
invitation out to Dr. Grinspoon and all
[SPEAKER_10]: these different people that have been show
over the years.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be pretty awesome to have just
like a nice flow of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Natasha said she would also help out
with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: As much as I want to be here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Next week, I will not be here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will be sitting in my seats in the
stadium in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will not be able to be on board.
[SPEAKER_14]: We will miss you.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be back the week after for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: And continue onward.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if the hurricane turns and it
goes to New Orleans?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the one behind it is what we're
concerned about and the one behind that as
[SPEAKER_14]: well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're keeping an eye and that's
happened before.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's happened to me for Katrina.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually bought actually my sister and
her kids and myself tickets to that game
[SPEAKER_14]: and I had to cancel the game.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that was the reality, I still have
those tickets, by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's just the reality of being from
the South is, you know, when hurricanes
[SPEAKER_14]: happen, you cancel.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't fight the system.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't fight the system.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mother nature wins.
[SPEAKER_14]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that happens, then I will be here,
you know, for sure next week.
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't fly out on Friday to New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll know by then and I'll keep you
posted.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I love to be here.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if that's an opportunity for me to be
here, then I'll enjoy that as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I yeah, these hurricanes are just man
that that that I mean, Harvey was bad
[SPEAKER_14]: enough for Houston.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's no municipality I know
could have survived four foot of water
[SPEAKER_14]: falling on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, anywhere, much less now,
you know, Irma coming right behind,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is just absolutely devastated the
Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, beyond some some places beyond
recognition, I saw a video today of
[SPEAKER_14]: somebody on a beach in the Bahamas and
there's no water at the beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: They had literally the storm had sucked
all the water for miles off the Atlantic
[SPEAKER_14]: completely.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just.
[SPEAKER_14]: The amount of force that that thing is
generating and the strength.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have people that are actually in the
path of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I send my love and I wish the best for
you because people can't afford to get
[SPEAKER_14]: out.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's reality.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wish them nothing but the best.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got other ones right behind that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know how after seeing these
storms that are considered once in a
[SPEAKER_14]: lifetime, once in a century, we've had
five of them in the last you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: 10 years or so before humans or at least
Americans who deny climate change start to
[SPEAKER_14]: believe that we're actually having effect
on the reality that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can't see with this type of evidence
out there that people still deny it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Doc, it's got to be absolutely dumb
funding for you to mean from a man of
[SPEAKER_14]: science to watch constant denial of actual
science, replicated science.
[SPEAKER_14]: And for them to go off of bullshit papers
that have actually been debunked to
[SPEAKER_14]: continue to deny a man's influence on the
weather that's happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, by senators whose states need
billions of dollars in government aid,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not amazing, but imagine if there
would have been a cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: Houston.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there was an industry like
cannabis on the ground in industrial areas
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, large cities like Houston,
like it is in Denver, it would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: completely wiped out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hands down, there's no way it could
survive a week without light.
[SPEAKER_14]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just all the water and then the,
you know, the water is filled with all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of runoff and toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would basically just wipe out
your entire crop and you'd lose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of equipment and your
facilities would just become completely
[SPEAKER_00]: fouled with all that mucky water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you see what people are doing is
they're coming in and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gutting their house at the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see everyone removing their,
their, their sheet rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it would be a good time to be
a Georgia Pacific selling sheet rocker
[SPEAKER_00]: Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sheet rock companies are probably
making a bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you'd have to imagine again that,
you know, like with a, something as
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating as this, I mean, it's like not
only something like this, like if this
[SPEAKER_00]: were to happen, if there were cannabis
industry in there, all the people who work
[SPEAKER_00]: there, well, right away, their houses are
flooded, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, their jobs are basically on hold,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their whole, you know,
operations is completely flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your whole life is just completely
devastated just because of a hurricane
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, and then out in Oregon,
you know, I mean, a whole state's on fire
[SPEAKER_00]: for Christ sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're going to find again,
someone had made this comment in chat
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier that outdoor Oregon in 2017 is
going to be the year of the concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: because everyone's going to have to
distill their stuff to make it not smoky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I, I don't know what the impact
of all the, all the smoke in the air is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be on, on these, these plants,
but um, certainly all the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were talking about it before you came
on doc.
[SPEAKER_14]: How the smoke in the ash and it not only,
you know, coats the plants, it also,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, coats the rosin, you know,
and that, that, you know, you can taste
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have actually, if any, anybody has
smoked cannabis that's been around a fire,
[SPEAKER_14]: you can taste it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It alters the flavor and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very, uh, as Sam was saying,
an unfortunate reality is, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's not good cannabis and that's just the
reality of farming.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's lost that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, um, translated into the
concentrates that you make from it too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say you could taste it in the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like smoking flour, but in the
concentrates is it also?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because it gets on the, it gets in
the glands, you know, and it stores,
[SPEAKER_14]: it doesn't stay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it does stay.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the plant continues to build
around it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's actually inside the crystals
themselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, Sam?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's no bueno.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's no bueno.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would make a little hash with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Jamaica, often they try to dry herb
around fires and certain people do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, you just smoke out the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a no no.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that Sam?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, it's a no no.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough said.
[SPEAKER_10]: Enough said.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a no no.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: And unfortunately, as we were saying,
you know, the entire Western United States
[SPEAKER_14]: is on fire right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: As well as, I mean, you're dealing with
that all up in BC.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, fires are going like mad up there
as well, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole province seems to be on fire
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't imagine it not affecting damn
near everyone's crop.
[SPEAKER_14]: So is it just dry right now?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is a rain's not coming through?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that why it's continuing to burn up
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pine beetle kill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry cinder block fucking trees.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, we have that problem here in
California from the last year's drought.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's millions of trees throughout the
Sierras right now that are just dead.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're trying to cut them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can literally see them brown
against the green all summer long.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's so spotted without you could see
why, you know, something like that would
[SPEAKER_14]: continue and why there's such,
you know, kindling out there for these
[SPEAKER_14]: fires.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I hate to hear of, you know,
that type of beetle breakout that's
[SPEAKER_14]: caused.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you're losing tons of forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mother nature's doing her purge.
[SPEAKER_05]: That forest needs to regrow and everything
because it's dead now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just unfortunate there's human
populations in the path of them now and
[SPEAKER_05]: that sort of stuff did get in the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I drove from Vancouver right up to
Prince George and for about six,
[SPEAKER_05]: 700 kilometres, it was so smoky you
couldn't see the valley, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch of miles ahead of you because the
smoke would cover the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then about the last 100 or so,
200 kilometres, it cleared up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also caught up this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say the whole province was the lower
province was hit for sure with all the
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I toured the upper province in the mid
summer when all the fires were happening
[SPEAKER_05]: and there was no fires up there and no
smoke or anything had reached up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's no dead beetle kill up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all plush, beautiful green forest for
as far as you can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite nice to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But down in this way, the lower province
is just devastated with pine beetle kill
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's a matchbook.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you get storms and you get one
lightning strike and it just goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: The matchbook lights up and just fucking
rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's killed a lot of wildlife.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole works has devastated this whole
province in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing you can do about it either.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just is what it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hopefully it rains come through and
quiets it down there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Makes it a little better.
[SPEAKER_14]: And beetles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pine beetle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Used to be cold enough that it'd kill
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But man-made lakes and all that sort of
stuff has changed weather patterns up here
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the winters are not as long as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the global change in
pattern, weather and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: As well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't get the winters like we used to
get here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even close, not even close.
[SPEAKER_05]: By Halloween, we'd have snow that stayed
right through till April.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have 20 to 40 below months,
two, three months maybe sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so fucking tasty.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what flavor is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is the Viper with Jamaican sour
diesel terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the really tasty one is at my booth
right now, which is the Where Is My Bike?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we put in Swiss.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I like, I like just the name.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where Is My Bike?
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to try this strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds so Amnesia Hayes-like.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is so Amnesia Hayes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a super old cut of Amnesia Hayes.
[SPEAKER_10]: A cut of some type of Kush, I think it
was.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I hadn't.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was about to say, I wish I had the news.
[SPEAKER_14]: They usually would send me the ICRS news.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for some reason, it's coming later in
the day now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't get it to give all the update
on what's the latest stuff on the news,
[SPEAKER_14]: because some people ask what's up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So sorry, it just depends on when it comes
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes out in the early morning,
when we do the show, I can actually read
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for some reason, it's coming out in
the afternoons now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, sometimes that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just try to go with the flow of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess we lost Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he texted me.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said that he was having a hard time
getting a connection.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm running connections a bit spotty,
so it might make it more difficult for you
[SPEAKER_10]: guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not too sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: You do come in choppy, but everybody else
seems to come in as normal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam's as usual choppy self.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are usually pretty good for me
when I'm at home.
[SPEAKER_10]: But while I still was, Natasha earlier was
like, oh, maybe you could just skip the
[SPEAKER_10]: day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, maybe I could skip the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: But like a week before the three year
anniversary, where we've never missed a
[SPEAKER_09]: single day, we're going to take a day off
before the three year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uber, and I raced back.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this event, what is the event you're
at?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarah Sunday's Karma Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty roots, but I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor Sarah gets a lot of hate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I seen one guy posting the other
day, like all the math.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's saying that, oh, she sold this
many passes for this much money.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, of these for this much money.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He privated his account.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then added up like a million bucks or
half a million bucks or $400,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just, you know, people are trying
to make it seem like she's just killing it
[SPEAKER_10]: and crushing it when really she's so
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many logistics.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so much work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's done a good job in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: The venue is not the best venue in the
world.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a parking lot hole in the ground type
of thing with booths in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's bringing, there are people
rocking through this thing left,
[SPEAKER_10]: right, and center.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were nonstop for 10 plus hours
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get a break.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how, because there's a size of
a parking lot, maybe a half an acre or a
[SPEAKER_10]: quarter of an acre even, maybe smaller,
but good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, haters are always going to hate,
but you know, it costs and takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: time and energy and people don't realize
the logistics.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, back when we would throw events,
I mean, just the cost of insurance alone,
[SPEAKER_14]: we had just one event.
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to have over a million dollars in
insurance just to hold the event.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't get off where people start to
start throwing that type unless they're
[SPEAKER_14]: actually on the inside and see what
actually goes down.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd be amazed how actually thin those
margins actually are.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you know, bubble man,
but it's, it's amazing when I see people
[SPEAKER_14]: on the outside starts, you know,
punching bag on people and stuff like
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just unfair unless you've actually
done it and thrown these types of things,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, there's no need for you to
comment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just either go and enjoy and rate the
event for exactly what it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: or isn't, you know, and if you don't like
it, go throw your event, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: people's energy and trying to do
something.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want the event that someone else is
throwing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like easier to criticize what
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I spoke at the normal part of the
conference yesterday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I spoke on a panel of growers and we
were just kind of talking about that very
[SPEAKER_10]: thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a, it's people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are a bit funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: I complain about access.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's 150 new stores that are going to
open up in Ontario to sell cannabis and
[SPEAKER_10]: everyone's upset about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, Oh, they're going to
control it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because like what they tried to do the
same thing with booze when booze was
[SPEAKER_10]: legalized, but they can't control it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's available on every street corner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Restaurants can fucking sell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like for God's sakes, there's bars that
are just places where people go and drink
[SPEAKER_10]: booze and the exact same thing will happen
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: LCB type stores that are government run
will never be able to control it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll just be one part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think people are so limited in their
ability to see the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_10]: They only see their slice of their pie
that they want.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, well, that's great,
but you know, there's a lot of people out
[SPEAKER_10]: there and they require all the slices of
the pie to be taken care of evenly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that with the normalization and
the acceptance of cannabis as a medicine
[SPEAKER_10]: and a recreational drug in society,
all of those things are going to come to
[SPEAKER_10]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Vapor lounges aren't going to go away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Vapor lounges are the new bars for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: No way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can promise you, no matter what any
government does, it will never go away.
[SPEAKER_10]: We tell them what we want.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how government works.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone should remind themselves of
that, that the government knows what's
[SPEAKER_10]: going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We decide as a society and then we make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, it's been slow in Canada,
but nonetheless, it's exactly what's been
[SPEAKER_10]: happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: We say that we wanted to, we got hemp
growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We said we wanted to grow our own personal
licenses slowly, but surely we got
[SPEAKER_10]: exemption 56 is an MMA ours.
[SPEAKER_10]: The MMA system so badly, they tried to get
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We fought in court and we won under
charter breaches.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in my opinion, fight for what you and
the things out there that you might not
[SPEAKER_10]: see as being the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then make it the way you take a giant
steaming shit on someone else's dream.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we almost had that happen to us this
week, actually in the United States,
[SPEAKER_14]: we had the Warbacher Bluenauer was
originally the Warbacher far amendment was
[SPEAKER_14]: initially pulled.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we thought we were going to be without
federal protection anymore, which
[SPEAKER_14]: basically the Warbacher Blumenauer
prohibited the federal government from
[SPEAKER_14]: going into any state where there is a
legal cannabis market, be it medical or
[SPEAKER_14]: recreational and could not spend any
money.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the whole reason why I won my case
against the federal government is because
[SPEAKER_14]: after a certain amount of time,
the federal prosecutor could not take me
[SPEAKER_14]: into court because they would have to pay
him to go into court.
[SPEAKER_14]: And by doing so, they would have violated
this amendment that has been passed
[SPEAKER_14]: alongside with the budget amendments.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was some budget shenanigans this
past week where Democrats and Republicans
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't think they were going to have
anything go through positively.
[SPEAKER_14]: But for some reason, Pelosi and the
Democrats put up a sort of a coup and
[SPEAKER_14]: educated 45, who is the current president
and he capitulated and went along with
[SPEAKER_14]: Democrats.
[SPEAKER_14]: And initially, it made sure that any type
of amendments were that were controversial
[SPEAKER_14]: amendments were pulled.
[SPEAKER_14]: And therefore, it looked like the
Warbacher Blumenauer was dead.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was for about 12 hours until the
next business day when the House and the
[SPEAKER_14]: Senate passed their own amendments of the
Warbacher Blumenauer, therefore
[SPEAKER_14]: reaffirming our protections and passed the
House and the Senate.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's attached to the current budget
that is funded through December.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks like it will be continually
added to each successful budget because
[SPEAKER_14]: our successful lobbying has got enough
Republican senators on board that we have
[SPEAKER_14]: a momentum that we haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is many years of hard work.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have to thank a lot of activists
that have made this a reality from eight
[SPEAKER_14]: years of failure of the Blumenauer FAR
amendment before it actually got passed.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it went from something that we
never thought was the possibility to now
[SPEAKER_14]: becoming a mainstay addition to each
budget and budget amendment, which is as
[SPEAKER_14]: big best as we can get until federal
prohibition changes.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the best type of protection that
we have currently to stave off any type of
[SPEAKER_14]: federal interference into our individual
liberty situations that are happening in
[SPEAKER_14]: these individual states by the 10th
Amendment.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're allowed to exist and be our own
little democracies, even in the face of
[SPEAKER_14]: federal law.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, that interference would be
very costly to the industry, needless to
[SPEAKER_14]: say.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were all initially in our industry
pretty worried for that 12 to 24 hours
[SPEAKER_14]: until they actually passed this amendment
if we were wondering if this was the,
[SPEAKER_14]: were we part of a backdoor deal that threw
us to the wolves or to Sessions and the
[SPEAKER_14]: DEA and them coming in.
[SPEAKER_14]: So fortunately, the momentum that we have
has been continued and it seems it's going
[SPEAKER_14]: to continue further because we're
continuing to lobby these Republican and
[SPEAKER_14]: Democratic senators.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're having meet and greets with them
constantly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those that are voted against us in the
past, this is how we built the momentum to
[SPEAKER_14]: get them to vote for us consistently.
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations to many hardworking
people and many staffers in Rohrbacher and
[SPEAKER_14]: Blumenauer for their very hard
determination, but this is also a friendly
[SPEAKER_14]: reminder, people, wake the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to still get involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is still very fragile.
[SPEAKER_14]: If they want to take us down, this is one
way that they could have easily reopened
[SPEAKER_14]: the floodgates.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you are still watching.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're a US citizen, you can call
your representative and your senator and
[SPEAKER_14]: tell them to stop this federal
interference and still make your voice
[SPEAKER_14]: heard.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're an individual citizen and each
voice that calls represents a hundred to a
[SPEAKER_14]: thousand, even up to 10,000 people per
phone call.
[SPEAKER_14]: So go out to your town hall meetings,
talk to your senators and your
[SPEAKER_14]: representatives, make them aware that you
are an informed citizen and that you need
[SPEAKER_14]: to be aware of how you feel regarding
cannabis and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can still get out there and get
involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, don't complain.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get off your ass and do something about
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, contact your representative,
your senator and make them aware of the
[SPEAKER_14]: changes and get involved locally.
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, remember 2018 is next year.
[SPEAKER_14]: These elections that are happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to see change, get behind
cannabis, get behind cannabis,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, supportive candidates out there
because they are out there and,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, go out there, go support them
right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: They could use your phone banking.
[SPEAKER_14]: They could use your dollars.
[SPEAKER_14]: They could use your, you know,
ability to pitch in in any way,
[SPEAKER_14]: shape or form.
[SPEAKER_14]: You may have a talent.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you can only talk on a phone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, go down and phone bank, volunteer,
get yourself actively involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you have a chance to be active
in this democracy to make us, make the
[SPEAKER_14]: future easier for us because we could have
quickly found this week ourselves all back
[SPEAKER_14]: behind the gun again and having the
federal government gunning for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is still that fragile.
[SPEAKER_14]: So our voices still have to, we have to be
active.
[SPEAKER_14]: So don't forget that people.
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, but we still can get more
involved.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony, good to see you buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, welcome Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just off pontificating.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was like, that was actually a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you were talking about the same
thing where they were trying to pass
[SPEAKER_08]: something in the budget bill, where it was
going.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we were worried they were,
you know, we were possibly as an industry
[SPEAKER_14]: thrown under the bus, but they amended it
and it's continued and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, that's credit to the momentum
that we've built, but we still have more
[SPEAKER_14]: momentum to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's just a stopgap measurement
until December the eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the way that, you know,
this government and it's run, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, you know, again, raising the debt
ceiling and doing what they need to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: have all their bills paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This amendment is just a rider on the
appropriations that basically the House
[SPEAKER_00]: Appropriations Committee has to approve
the spending of all, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: years and eyes tax dollar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And God knows they're not the best
stewards of that money.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, until we have a law where something
actually changes, this is the balance we
[SPEAKER_14]: have.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're trying to get behind that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's why we also why I was ranting
is we need people involved so that with
[SPEAKER_14]: that, if enough of these people hear from
their constituency regarding this issue,
[SPEAKER_14]: they're going to leave us alone.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're already affecting some of these
Republican and Democratic senators,
[SPEAKER_14]: but there's still many out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: We still have to affect change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is number the eighth, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, well, and then it will be
continued on with the next the same way
[SPEAKER_14]: with the next budget.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this is unfortunately the game the
government's playing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, they are punting everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is I mean, they've got everything
from DACA to, you know, the wall and all
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And top of that tax cuts that they're
going to try and all pass all of this time
[SPEAKER_14]: in December.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's too much to punt.
[SPEAKER_14]: And on top of that, you've got 45
insulting the Republicans daily now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So even those that are his supporters,
he's pissing on no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, I just the cohesiveness is not
going away.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, we have enough Republican and
Democratic support and continue to
[SPEAKER_14]: maintain that that any continuing budget
in the future, this continues to get added
[SPEAKER_14]: to and will continue to be added towards.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, it is up until December 8.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there will either there will be a
slight time between where they will take
[SPEAKER_14]: the budget and they will be either shut
down the government temporarily,
[SPEAKER_14]: which they won't do in December because
it's the holidays.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to do that to their
government employees.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going to be just another
continuation until, you know, remember,
[SPEAKER_14]: the government's fiscal year starts
October to October.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're already emergency funding for the
year.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have to resolve the situation.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, they're still going to use all
these political realities, DACA,
[SPEAKER_14]: the wall, et cetera, as, you know,
negotiation points, or at least 45 is
[SPEAKER_14]: going to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, this we should get out of politics
and get back onto cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, people.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just the reality of where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a separation of church and state.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Blame me.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's that's me trying to fill space
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: 70s mama in the chat room saying that her
bubble man pan is currently ripping her
[SPEAKER_10]: head off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to hear 70s mama.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad it's.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like 70s mama.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the name of her.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's got a podcast called Sisterhood of
the Traveling Plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the name.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very funny.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_10]: Samurai Sam really was kind of the
inspiration behind the pen inadvertently
[SPEAKER_10]: by Ash complaining all about the shitty
things that are in behind the pens and how
[SPEAKER_10]: dangerous they can be and how inexpensive
and non-sustainable and now Omicron
[SPEAKER_10]: introduced me to Gary, turned me on to the
whole uptech family.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to Samurai Sam for helping us
out big time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I and Gary wouldn't be here where we
are with this pen right now without you,
[SPEAKER_10]: brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: So give thanks for your your part.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, and his knowledge drop is still got
to be one of the most epic ones on,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, Hash Church where he broke all
those down because that seemed to be the
[SPEAKER_14]: way things are going.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, look what has changed,
you know, across the industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, look how everything is really
improved.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really made consumers aware of
what's actually they're inhaling and it
[SPEAKER_14]: made them realize what they need to look
for in these types of devices.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's why a lot of us have gone
back to our either manual or electric way
[SPEAKER_14]: of imbibing as opposed to now you from
those frustrations.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look what, you know, you and Tony have
created along with, you know, Omicron,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you've taken it to the next
steps because now we know what was bad and
[SPEAKER_14]: what's out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we know then what we wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now you're creating one of those
aspects of things that people want to see.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need apparatus that you can utilize
and make viscous things like rouse them
[SPEAKER_14]: through that you can inhale what that
you're on the go.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, that didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, kudos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still owe you yours, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need to drive to you today.
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you in Oakland?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just chilling.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go for a bike ride and I
got to go see Ed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Check in with him.
[SPEAKER_14]: When are you going on that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably after breakfast, some breakfast
after this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And although it looks to be kind of hot
today, so we may want to, we may ride
[SPEAKER_14]: later in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me know when you're done biking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, I'm going to go visit I
think Duchess's garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen, I've seen pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she, she plays her steel drum to her
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: She did a video of it the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea that she was like a
professional steel drum player,
[SPEAKER_08]: but she played like, I don't know,
it was like Beethoven or something to show
[SPEAKER_08]: me.
[SPEAKER_14]: The inventor of that actually actually
teaches at West Virginia university.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: He, he came on a few years ago as a,
as a musical teacher.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course I still have friends that
are musicians there.
[SPEAKER_14]: In Morgantown, cause it's still a strong
music scene.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, so he's, he's doing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, that's, that's, that's quite a
talent.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's quite a, a musical sound all unto
itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: So kudos there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What, cause the last thing I remember
about that was when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_08]: we used to watch like Sesame street or
some show that we watched.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like the make, they showed like
a real cool, like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_08]: after kids program or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, they showed like people
rolling out a barrel, like a trash can.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they would show them cutting off the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would show it forming it,
you know, Oh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like forming the whole steel
drum from, from just throw away material
[SPEAKER_08]: repurposing.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: They made musical instruments out of the
cast away oil containers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And look, now it's a complete musical
instrument.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's world renowned, you know,
but it was all made from throw away and
[SPEAKER_14]: the need to have a percussion.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it made such a beautiful, unique sound
that yeah, it still continues to this day,
[SPEAKER_14]: but she's quite talented as a grower,
as well as a hash maker, but as well as a
[SPEAKER_14]: musician.
[SPEAKER_14]: So good job there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got us keep it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's very good at very, very good at the
steel drum.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm, I'm a big believer in having
music in my gardens.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always had classical or jazz always 24
seven going on, you know, in my gardens
[SPEAKER_14]: when I was growing, cause I always found a
good response.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know some people like heavy metal or
other types of things, but I've always
[SPEAKER_14]: been, yeah, I've always found plants
respond to music.
[SPEAKER_08]: How did, you know, I don't know if they
ever talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_08]: How did, have you ever heard of,
or you've seen anyone use like,
[SPEAKER_08]: just like you can in your house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like my house has these little ultrasound
pet devices, pest device that like pushes
[SPEAKER_08]: off all like kind of hits a frequency that
we can't hear sometimes can be harmful for
[SPEAKER_08]: dogs, but it pushes bugs, you know,
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't really talk about using sound
for in the gardens, but I've used sound
[SPEAKER_08]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anyone else has,
or if there's any like great device out
[SPEAKER_08]: there that everyone just raves about that
maybe should be shared out there,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a sound device, tried something like
that, but it didn't work for ants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ants that did not work for it all.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's some hardy kind of ants around
here as well in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think, I think that's the one
field that we've got everything else,
[SPEAKER_08]: the UV lighting, the scrubbing,
you know, filtration, air filters.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's still open,
you know, cause there are frequencies that
[SPEAKER_08]: we could, if we could test the different
types of spider mites and kinds of bugs
[SPEAKER_08]: and then kind of bring them into more of a
study of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet we'd find a frequency that would
push them out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, sonic frequencies that would make
them uncomfortable so that they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_14]: want to nest, you know, or lay eggs,
you know, that's the, that's what you want
[SPEAKER_14]: any type of, you know, preventing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, you would think that
they would, if that type of situation
[SPEAKER_14]: would exist, that would exist on the large
scale agricultural you know, reality,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like large scale NFT systems would,
what do you think of that Sam's sonic pest
[SPEAKER_14]: control?
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you aware of?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really comment, but I have
insect pheromones to attract them to traps
[SPEAKER_03]: either for monitoring or for destroying
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I've never used the vibrations of
any kind.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know plants are affected by
vibrations and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're affected by good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The insects don't seem to be affected by
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess they're either good
vibrations or bad vibrations, depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think let me look this up because I'm
pretty sure that one, if it's the beach
[SPEAKER_08]: boys, we know it's good vibrations.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had these things that I bought on
Amazon, these little pest control things,
[SPEAKER_08]: since there was a lot of spiders actually
in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, I'm like kind of allergic
to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people say spiders don't bite,
but they love to bite me for whatever
[SPEAKER_08]: reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as soon as I put these in each one of
the rooms, no more bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and I'll tell you what the frequency
is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I was worried about my dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said something about cats.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any plants at the house?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It said something about, it was a certain
way that's here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We look at ultrasonic, electronic pest,
insect repellent device, clander,
[SPEAKER_08]: hyper sound, and do pest woes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably have to be really intense,
but there's probably a reason why it
[SPEAKER_08]: hadn't been developed before.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I see 20 Hertz mice will run.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got different sounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you kind of Google it, some of it,
some of the stuff out there is bullshit,
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's definitely set to frequencies
or do you dial it in depending on your
[SPEAKER_08]: past?
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just set to free.
[SPEAKER_08]: They only sell devices that are set to
certain things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, like it's a certain frequency of
range, like 20.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at where that was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it's, some of it's kind of scammy.
[SPEAKER_08]: See here.
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the name of the brand?
[SPEAKER_14]: Just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you may have known off the top
of your head.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I already forgot it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a stoner.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Time for a bong rip people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an easy one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pest reject.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well on Wikipedia, they have, they kind of
call out the bullshit ones, the good ones
[SPEAKER_08]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it work on mother-in-laws?
[SPEAKER_08]: Allow two weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not work on mother-in-laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you could change, if you could
change the frequency, I bet it would.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two weeks for sound waves to affect pets,
pests within established.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's, I'm just, it's just
like, it's, it's in its really early
[SPEAKER_08]: stage, but I bet you somebody out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got all kinds of gophers safe for
pets.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got gophers in your house,
but they do throw those.
[SPEAKER_08]: They throw those.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they throw like, you know,
if you've, uh, you don't see gophers in
[SPEAKER_03]: your house.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in the attic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honest review.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bunch of them out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's a micron corporate.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one from a micron corporation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so these are just a direct plug in the
wall type of modules.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes, it says it takes a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: To build up the frequency or I put a bunch
of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put one in every room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it all bounce around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes two weeks for them to get so
tired of the noise.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I think it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if you started with your
garden with a frequency that was really
[SPEAKER_08]: like annoying, it'd be like just a
horrible like rock concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just, just no one was in tune.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like they came to a party and they
were like, Oh, this looks like a good
[SPEAKER_08]: party and like all horrible combinations
of sounds and like almost like an MRI
[SPEAKER_08]: probably for them, you know, MRI scan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and how long, how long have you been
using it?
[SPEAKER_08]: A few months.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of them on online.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some of them that more expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are cheaper.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one I found the guardian.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has control for this has raccoons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Deer, squirrels, cats, chipmunks,
bats, mice and rats.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can actually dial it in on the
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you could say predator volume.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, so that when you can directly dial
into your, okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you got deer or something like that,
I got turkeys.
[SPEAKER_08]: So does that have a Turkey setting?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it does not have a Turkey setting.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one does have a mother-in-law
setting.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, well there you go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lower frequency drum and bass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really low place in drum and bass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your mother-in-law will go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crack on bass nectar at five in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll be running for the door.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, serious shit going on with this
hurricane though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone that's in Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: My, uh, prayers and thoughts out to my
family is their mother, dad, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone in Miami and Broward.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't turned on the TV this morning,
but I was watching it till like two in the
[SPEAKER_08]: morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, my best man.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't miss that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You grew up with that, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in New Orleans, Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I was actually in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have had tornadoes, uh, hurricanes,
floods.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got, I would say, probably PTSD from
storms, but, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always, uh, I always have this fear
now that I'm, I thought I was okay from
[SPEAKER_08]: earthquakes where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh, I realized like,
I'm like right on a fault line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the only thing I haven't
experienced it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually seen a volcano to erupting.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it's, it's very humbling.
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time I remember it was the first
time I actually did, uh, speed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and, um, yeah, it was back in 1992
and, uh, yeah, I was literally,
[SPEAKER_14]: everybody left the house and I was playing
my bass and then the earth just gave a
[SPEAKER_14]: nice big old jolt and I never felt so
small or minuscule, but, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't look, I honestly, I spent my whole
life growing up in New York and dealing
[SPEAKER_14]: with hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would rather be out here and deal with
an earthquake any day than to deal with
[SPEAKER_14]: having to board up the windows and hunt,
you know, hunger down and loss of signal
[SPEAKER_14]: and, you know, all that, you know,
deal with this re dealing with
[SPEAKER_14]: refrigerators and all that shit you have
to deal with when your shit gets flooded
[SPEAKER_08]: and earthquakes can be bad though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you saw in Mexico, man,
that was an 8.1.
[SPEAKER_08]: You study the Richter scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people don't realize like every time
it goes from like a five or six or six or
[SPEAKER_08]: seven, it's not just one unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a multitude of, uh, things that,
I mean, a difference between like a seven
[SPEAKER_08]: and eight is like 50, uh, 50 nuclear bombs
or something, you know, the size of it
[SPEAKER_08]: would be like 50 nuclear bombs between the
two digits or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and the amount, yeah, because the
amount of shifting that's happening and
[SPEAKER_14]: the, I mean, look at the last huge one
that was here, the Loma Prieta one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I mean, it shifted things by feet.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, an 8.1 would definitely move
things by yards.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: 8.1 serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's like, so anyone out in Mexico,
again, got some prayers with you got
[SPEAKER_08]: people in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that they just lost some power,
but they were okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just crazy out there right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of storms, a lot of,
it's how extremely normal than anything,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's a, back in the day,
I watched this guy, Greg something,
[SPEAKER_08]: they took him off of YouTube, but he used
to be with NASA.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he's a good, he's like a, forget what
his background was as a scientist,
[SPEAKER_08]: but he, I don't know if you've ever talked
about net zero before, like when the
[SPEAKER_08]: planet gets to net zero.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you ever heard of that before?
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You may want to explain it to,
I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't know what he said, but essentially
what happens is, uh, our North and South
[SPEAKER_08]: Poles, they, they flip and this is,
uh, evident on the, uh, where our plates
[SPEAKER_08]: touch and on bottom of the ocean,
you see lines that go this way and then
[SPEAKER_08]: they go this way and it's 3,600 miles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, 3,600 years or so, I don't know,
there's an average in there where it
[SPEAKER_08]: happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Einstein says that our planet goes
through, uh, kind of a bigger shift every
[SPEAKER_08]: 86,000 miles, 86,000 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that doesn't mean our planet like goes
off or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the way that our magnetics work
and our North and South work, but there's
[SPEAKER_08]: a point that we get to that's like a net
zero when that happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, all kinds of like different theories
have spawned off from that of what
[SPEAKER_08]: happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, does the ice age,
uh, happen when the North, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: when we hit a net zero point and we cycle
through as a planet every so often and
[SPEAKER_08]: we're just kind of riding it like a wave
and, you know, depends if we're good or
[SPEAKER_08]: bad, we influence that ride differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but there is a, uh, resonant frequency
of, of things that exist in all things and
[SPEAKER_08]: the planet has one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I think it was Einstein that was
laughed at when he first talked about it,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the planet has a pulse frequency or a
resonant frequency.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so our frequency, if you look at like
our planet as a, as a grouping of time,
[SPEAKER_08]: a bunch of different tiny little marbles
that makes up a sphere that, and you think
[SPEAKER_08]: of it as a vibration, think of those
things being held together.
[SPEAKER_08]: By, by, uh, a grav, gravitational pull and
our rotation, our pull with the star.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of this is very important to keep
these little marbles together,
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's a frequency, a resonant
frequency is a vibration, just like that's
[SPEAKER_08]: why they use courts, uh, for like
turntables and for watches, because once
[SPEAKER_08]: you put a frequency or vibration on it,
it holds it perpetually like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, very good at holding and responding to
frequencies where other, and it's an,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's a neutral courts is neutral.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one of the only elements that's
actually neutral, but everything has these
[SPEAKER_08]: tones and frequencies.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why people talk about chakras and
open them with tuning forks or bowls,
[SPEAKER_08]: tie bowls, those sound effects kind of can
help tune.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could tune crystals as well in stones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, people do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and so there's that frequency that's
out there in our planet, uh, is to said to
[SPEAKER_08]: be speeding up since we've been monitoring
it, which kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're going through a north and
south flip and you're getting to a net
[SPEAKER_08]: zero point, that frequent, that,
that vibration, uh, would be more and more
[SPEAKER_08]: intense.
[SPEAKER_08]: You follow me?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then that's what would lead to,
uh, that in contributing to like our
[SPEAKER_08]: salient count in the water, the greenhouse
gases, different things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: affect the planet on a whole, uh,
Fukushima dumping nuclear waste into our
[SPEAKER_08]: ocean, things like that, that doesn't go
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, um, those things will affect,
have an influence on storms as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you would see more earthquakes,
you would see more storms, you would see
[SPEAKER_08]: more, more activity than maybe you would
see in the last 100, 200 years that's been
[SPEAKER_08]: documented.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that makes any sense?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I think we, I think we as humans
and, and we contribute, we, we contribute
[SPEAKER_08]: to, uh, that, that change in these
experiences.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I also do think that it happens,
uh, it happens naturally and it occurs in
[SPEAKER_08]: cycles, um, and kind of how our planet
recycles kind of like a forest burns down,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, and re without a doubt,
it actually, I mean, the polls are going
[SPEAKER_14]: to switch.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, uh, when I was in the military,
um, wherever we were in the world,
[SPEAKER_14]: we always had to declinate our compasses
to, you know, true north.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we always, we're, we're, we were
taught in there that there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: there's, there's a kind of a shifting
that's happening as it was already
[SPEAKER_14]: happening back when I was in the military
in the nineties, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: in the eighties and the nineties,
uh, that showed that there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: already, uh, a degree change due to the,
the polls and it was continuing and it
[SPEAKER_14]: only is going to get more extreme until
the actual polls flip.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing is, is it should have already
happened already by those calculations.
[SPEAKER_14]: So either we're about to go through a
polar flip or it's currently happening as
[SPEAKER_14]: we speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's also a great point because,
uh, think about all of the, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: the travelers that, uh, set sail and all
the devices that existed, uh, that allow
[SPEAKER_08]: you to see true north, you know,
birds have, birds have iron, a sliver of
[SPEAKER_14]: iron in their beaks that helps them find
true north as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would affect migrations.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: They found that out, uh, through biology
is that's why they're able to find north
[SPEAKER_14]: and south so well as they actually have a
bit of iron in their beak that points them
[SPEAKER_14]: magnetically in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've kind of evolved on us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks like we're losing most of the
people here, but I did want to say one
[SPEAKER_08]: thing that, um, I'm really happy to see
the, uh, industry, at least on the
[SPEAKER_08]: solvent, the site starting to push the,
uh, sauces and the THC a, um, I think it's
[SPEAKER_08]: important movement.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, uh, you know, kind of why that,
the whole idea why bubble men,
[SPEAKER_08]: I were talking about creating these types
of tanks because once you, when you get
[SPEAKER_08]: something saucy, you can't really put it
in a jar.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't put it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you really, it's hard to keep
it in a place.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the tank itself is, um, something that
I think is good, just as if you're buying
[SPEAKER_08]: them as an empty, you know, you just buy
an empty kit, um, and you press rosin at
[SPEAKER_08]: home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you can double press, uh, that rosin
and have THC a and have your sauce that
[SPEAKER_08]: sauces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unbelievable in these little tanks,
like really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and, and you got to put them in
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, it's just nice to have the options
now to mix that and seeing people going
[SPEAKER_08]: for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I remember a year or two years ago,
people just still, they still just hate on
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, man, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's a natural progression of
things.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to adapt, you know,
or, you know, somebody is going to find
[SPEAKER_14]: something that will.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's good to see that there's more
options out there for people, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: people and patients because they read
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they need to have access.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, it's always
comes back down to the grower and the
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you can't, you can't just
fabricate really good product.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, the person doing the
extraction or separation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's about, you know, it's a good
40% or so, but once you have the tools and
[SPEAKER_08]: the knowledge, every time, if you run a
lot of stuff, it comes down to,
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something new.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a new flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a new head structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did that yield so much more?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that all clear?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just different, unique
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always find it interesting when,
you know, we wash resin and, it gets
[SPEAKER_08]: freeze dried and it's all looks beaming
white.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've got, we've got different micron
runs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get like first run, second run,
third run, fourth run.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even in the first or second runs
between the 73, 90, 120, 45, and you go to
[SPEAKER_08]: pressing, you get different shades,
different colors every time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same exact, you know, you make a
variation, you make a change in the way
[SPEAKER_08]: you would press based on, you know,
if it's a, a three or four or five star
[SPEAKER_08]: type of a hash going in before it gets
pressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even with those slight adjustments,
you're just making those adjustments,
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it's pressure or just a few
degrees or things like that based on the
[SPEAKER_08]: melt, because you're, you don't want to
blow your, you don't want to blow out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But ultimately, if you're washing and
pressing, you'll see all kinds of
[SPEAKER_08]: variations.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you see like a second run,
73, very small, and then the third run
[SPEAKER_08]: really big.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first one in the third run is so
much better than the second, even when you
[SPEAKER_08]: go to press it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just find it fascinating.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like when Frenchy was talking to me
one time about a lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you've got this big lemon
tree, you go up to it and you shake it and
[SPEAKER_08]: the fruit falls down, you know,
and you grab the fruit and you all eat off
[SPEAKER_08]: of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could, you go up to it again and
you shake it and shake it again and more
[SPEAKER_08]: fruit comes off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, it's just interesting how the
plant, when you look at it on a small
[SPEAKER_08]: level, the different trichomes,
how they're developing, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: an indoor versus an outdoor, things that
I've seen, those heads don't really extend
[SPEAKER_08]: out in the winter cycles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get a lot of, so if your plant
tested, you know, 15% THC, those heads
[SPEAKER_08]: aren't extended all the way out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a lot of them by the surface.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with CBD, CBD flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't wash very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your first light depth gets better.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then full season seems like the heads
fully extend and you're able to get more
[SPEAKER_08]: of the resin in its full melt capacity
than you were in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_08]: even though it's still there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of like the sun itself and
the intensity of the sun itself allows for
[SPEAKER_08]: the secretion and to push up higher into
its head, into its sack.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the sun's not there, the intensity
is not there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't quite push up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not secreting up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it kind of has more of an oil at its
surface instead of a little bit away from
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with indoor, you know, there's
advantages to indoor if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_08]: full malt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fresh frozen indoor, if you had a very
even canopy of the same variety,
[SPEAKER_08]: you've been growing it a while under a
certain intensity of light, you tend to,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're going to grow it to an exact
date, you know, you tend to see very
[SPEAKER_08]: uniform head structure and that distance
from the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you tested something that was 25%,
20% indoor, you're like, oh, we got a 14%
[SPEAKER_08]: yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of that 14% yield, you'll get a good 30%
plus a full melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, where you might have a big wide
gap of varieties if it was an outdoor
[SPEAKER_08]: winter cycle, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's places for it all.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, and that's the reality of seasons.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, in farming, you know,
you have to deal with those changes that
[SPEAKER_14]: are going to happen, depending on which
season you're growing, as well as which
[SPEAKER_14]: one you're processing.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people are in the chat?
[SPEAKER_08]: About 472.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, with respect to the 472,
as you and I are bullshitting and talking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam's listening.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bumbleman's having some technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes it 473.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's get the chat involved for a
second.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's everybody in chat smoking on?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is always so fun to watch happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you smoking on people?
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that's interesting is to
ask the chat from which country are you
[SPEAKER_03]: are you chatting from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's interesting to see how
widespread we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out your country.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out your country or your area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: How the hell do you guys look at this
chat?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always wanted to figure out how you
guys look at this chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You must have to open it up on YouTube,
huh?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you open it up on YouTube and you
can watch it live.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got people from all around India,
UK.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_14]: Trump land.
[SPEAKER_14]: Trump land.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, put your neck what you're smoking
with your region, people.
