[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the house and you want to make the
announcement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Puff Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, when's the last time we filmed a Puff
Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was doing the Facebook thing
and I got a reminder a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you a puff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we start this Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the time out part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm liking this Cookies Butter Rosin
because it's sticky and gooey and holds
[SPEAKER_01]: its position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can go in and add a little of
this, you know, shattery congolese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he said congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can go in and we can do a
little turp dip, whether you want to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cush Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what do I want to hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grape Ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Orange Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Swiss Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Covello Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Cherry AK-47.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, out of the two,
four, six, seven, which one do you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try?
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with the Cookies and the Congolese,
you know, you got this cushy, cushy sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of exotic, turpinoline, congo thing going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could do Cush Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty much going to try them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it gets off nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is how we clean our resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I said that out loud, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tricky carb cap because there's
hash in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you put it on here, you're going to
melt this hash and it's going to drip
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that a ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ninja dab of sorts, but it's like a
never ending ninja dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be aware of that while you're
dabbing this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday with Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both so busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: is busy as heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm busy as heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get together every Sunday at Hash
Church, but other than that, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: been like two ships crossing in the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see him at events, but we don't,
we haven't even really been able to hang
[SPEAKER_01]: out at the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you at Lyft and I was like on the
last day and I was like, Hey, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, hey, whoa, you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I miss Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, does that ever look beautiful?
[SPEAKER_01]: That little, just that little piece that
melted off looks so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's getting a little carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps giving you a rip long after
you've taken your rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always about those things that work
really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: A for one, saltless resin works very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it surely does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now those turps, I've tried a lot of
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of turps are out there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got some kind of turp or this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of turps, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even have these turps here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing like these turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's truly a different flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just different levels,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you first, well,
it's why there was a star rating created
[SPEAKER_01]: for a full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's why there's going to
become, there's going to be a rating
[SPEAKER_01]: attributed to terpenes, at least in the
sense, like the way we will say fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we might want to say organic
greenhouse whole plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: over, if you've made it out of trim,
if you've made it from like Indra was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing with, that's really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Indra was doing with his
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was talking about that on Hash
Church there on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just missed the last one,
that was Hash Church 105.
[SPEAKER_02]: 105.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This got clean, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty impressed with how clean I got
the dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know what, like,
even listening to him talk about his
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences over the years and the amount
of time that he's put into, he was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like hidden in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all he was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool that, you know,
the research that he's done over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's now sharing, of course on Hash
Church, which is the best place to listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to that, what do we say, bombs being
dropped?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was doing the coal trap on his
oven and getting his turps out of his out
[SPEAKER_01]: of his slab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think all of those things are
substantially different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there should be almost like,
you should put that on the packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just that they're cannabis derived,
but they're derived from an oil slab,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they're derived from trim, or they're
derived from, you know, top quality
[SPEAKER_01]: organic bud, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they are caught in that trap or if
they're distilled to, I mean, if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: steamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: However.
[SPEAKER_02]: However they are, they should,
exactly, should be marked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to give almost like a
star rating for turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I'm not looking for
people's techniques to find out exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing, but I want to know
what the starting material they used was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have a high interest in
knowing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we had a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a little stoned, but now we're
going to get into that plan, which was to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of talk about some of our Puff
Wednesdays that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some Puff Wednesdays on boats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some Puff Wednesdays on boats
and on bridges and on mountains and in
[SPEAKER_01]: gondolas and in vehicles and on decks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've definitely had some good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, reminiscent, one of my favorite
Puff Wednesdays would be the time we went
[SPEAKER_01]: up to Squamish and did the gondola.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a pretty quality Puff
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I always like to talk
about is, you know, that gondola trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever get a chance, you got to go up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we ever do a Puff Wednesday in Spain
or Amsterdam or Toronto or Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did one in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we do a Puff Wednesday with Tony?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jibs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jibs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Gothic region.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got that reminder on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's why I'm reminding them about
the Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get your memory reminders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your memory reminders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one was the one where we're sitting
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we look like kids at Kalimantan today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you just got the mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy because that was a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what that means is that John and I
have aged incredibly poorly in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're falling apart here, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Falling apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me give you another rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even with the way and how things have
happened over in the Puff Wednesdays,
[SPEAKER_02]: first it was that we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the dry sift rip that we first
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was coming back from Amsterdam in
2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't really a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of what led into all of
these Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was really the beginning of sort
of us doing videos together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I wasn't even really doing
that many videos at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had this resin you were so stoked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I am going to show this
guy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't know you very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show this guy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he's going to be pretty
stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea you'd be as stoked as you
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, yeah, we just cleaned this resin
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like an hour plus of time that we
worked on it, just carding and carding and
[SPEAKER_01]: carding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We even spilled some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got it to 99.9% heads,
and we did that rip, and we filmed that
[SPEAKER_01]: rip, that was for sure a bit of a game
changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it was a total game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed everything for me when I knew
about hash and resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed me something that no one showed
me before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were just like, hey, check this
out, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, how come I didn't know all this
shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, well, you haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it with dry sift all the time,
even still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was only a few years ago,
three or four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 2012 when that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, December 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, so almost 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this lovely mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave you the Shatter Congo this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dipped you into some grape ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So through all the Puff Wednesdays,
we've always had different types of always
[SPEAKER_02]: being solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how it's evolved, even with the
static sifting to the raws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Puff Wednesdays, I've gone
through all of these changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quiver that you've created over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the solventless quiver is for sure a
real part of our lives these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we sit out here in a late
September, you know, just going into fall
[SPEAKER_01]: here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be 22 or 23 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be 75 to 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not bad for up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't all live in igloos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting an Indian summer up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that we often do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, September is usually pretty nice
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep going in and out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a hit, you got to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to be puffing bowls with Johnny
B.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: After spending so much time together,
filming so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puff Wednesday was one show we filmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to film much more often than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was big changes in the last couple of
years since I had a baby and John got more
[SPEAKER_01]: into his own channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, your baby is just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing to have kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's the way the industry is
changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: With business and the new systems that are
coming forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you've been so busy with,
of course, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, terpenes have been a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been taking up a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when Tony started Blue River,
it was a natural thing to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: give support to it due to the quality of
the product that was coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was just it's just such a
high quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy for me to get behind and be
supportive of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that I was going to end up
starting a Blue River in Canada and and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of promoting and supporting him that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the collaborations that we do
between our two brands down in California
[SPEAKER_01]: have been extremely well received.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Terp oil and the Terp rosin and Terp
bubble that are available down there
[SPEAKER_01]: through Harborside and the BPG Berkeley's
patient group and many other places that
[SPEAKER_01]: are slowly starting to pick these up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's beyond exciting, you know,
to be able to have I wish the mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: was here that I could be a part of my own
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how hard that is for me to not be
able to promote my own hash and my own
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the way the system is with the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still feels pretty great to be able to,
you know, to bring a great to to bring a
[SPEAKER_01]: great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, something that adds like we were
always saying was scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time something new and great
comes out, something else follows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this whole mixing even with with
that health well with Health Canada with
[SPEAKER_02]: the new ACM PR.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those different regulations were how
you can't use any solvents for
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions, even if it is your own stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like rosin just kind of flew right
into there like just like under the radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you really all these little things
that we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good to see how everything I
do we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say how we can continue
doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we fought.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're still fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still places being shut down and
access is going to be really, really hard
[SPEAKER_02]: for people who are looking for different
kinds of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think this last fight was for
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was for home growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was for homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now the fight will be for
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fight for dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a different aspect,
you know, because the dispensary model is
[SPEAKER_01]: a profit driven business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different than someone fighting
for their right to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not a profit driven business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Access is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think, well, we all know it wasn't
even a thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing was being able to
get the right to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's a matter of getting more
people access.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was speaking with Ramo on this very
topic today and it was just sort of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, yeah, just let the growers who
are able to and the people who want to
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute through dispensary models that
are able to follow the simple rules and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And test all your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm looking forward to that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way we're not going to have
dispensaries in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're essential to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people need those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to them every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I went to UPS and this lady,
she's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's 71 years old, still working at UPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm picking up, I had to pick a bunch
of Bolivar Packs and they were just
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I show up there and I'm sitting there
talking to her about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She starts smiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reach in my truck and I show her one of
the med-tainers and I go, would you use
[SPEAKER_02]: one?
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, damn straight I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I handed her this grab bag and she
said, oh, we're just going to love these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's, that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right away she's talking about her
pain and everything while she was working
[SPEAKER_02]: at UPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: 71, she's been there for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, I could throw them around
before, but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's using cannabis for her pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what came up in a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just good stuff like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's access has to be granted for say the
70 year old lady who needs cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is she getting it from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Guarantee she's getting it from a local
dispensary in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the same way people don't want to be
controlled and, and, and sort of forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase from an LP, there are other
people who want to be, don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled and forced to buy from a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we should have farmer markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it all, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm absolutely pleased as punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puffing some bowls here with you,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen this through all of our puff
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to hit another bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we definitely need at least one
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want this ACDC?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were kind of looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try the ACDC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another high CBD cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that there's any CBD or cannabinoids
in these terpenes, but the profile that it
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of is a high CBD cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one day I'm going to have to sit
down and watch all of the puff one things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole slew of playlists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would have to go, you know,
kind of go look through them to be
[SPEAKER_01]: reminded.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the dry sift videos that we've
done on Puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made product on a lot of Puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were always doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you did the conga wheeze on
your birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a beautiful day for just enjoying
some bowls, hanging out with all of you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys watching YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We much appreciate it for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already, give us a
subscribe and a like if you've enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of conversation that we're
having.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure go check out John H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burfellow over on his YouTube channel as
well and 420weedmaster on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bcbubbleman on Instagram as well as
Blue River Canada, Blue River Extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should finish it with a bowl while you
talk us out, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or cough us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever works, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to cough us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to sit here and cough a
tiny bit, but wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have the rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, oh, I had some sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can top you off with some sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to top me off with some sift,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a, I was at, I was previously at
a cup in Saskatchewan and a gentleman
[SPEAKER_02]: there goes, I watched all you guys'
videos, man, and I got some sift and he
[SPEAKER_02]: handed it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of cool to actually add it
to your little quiver there at the end
[SPEAKER_02]: because you got, now you got a,
oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you would have seen how that just
happened and now you can see the little
[SPEAKER_02]: heads on there, how that just like really
defined.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just like, shoo, shoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you saw little balls for a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you guys would have seen that,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been a good macro shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been an amazing macro
shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and just how the little because
this is, this is static sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I carded this a few times
with the DVD and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, this is all amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to do one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, we'll probably do another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he thought that when I was going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we did the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really tasty, really clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those products, obviously rosin,
the dry sift, the Terps clean as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whistle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't cough on every hit either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you a little dip, dip,
dip, dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the dip, dip, dip, dip,
dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we got to grab the Congo first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the sift and the Congo together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the part that you can just
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause right now you can just see all these
little balls on the end of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: which you've seen in all the videos
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you have, but when it goes into
it, it just goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, I have to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost goes like, almost like it's
crystallizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe that press in there
with the big, I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, why do you have a giant air
compressor in your office?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like to run my Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a nice big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should give you a good cough and a good
rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be nicely toasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go sit in my backyard for about an hour or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Puff Wednesday, we're going to do
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a reminder that Puff
Wednesday will be coming to you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more often these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming by Johnny D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to keep hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not leaving, but you guys are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So peace out everybody.
