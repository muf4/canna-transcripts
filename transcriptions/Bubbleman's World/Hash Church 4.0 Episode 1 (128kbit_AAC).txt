[SPEAKER_08]: Live on the old Zootuba.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I'm telling you, I was in bed like
three minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: This meeting is being live streamed.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know where the old YouTube
video is, where the chat is, and where I
[SPEAKER_08]: usually send the link.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully people just figure it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, there we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Hash Church 4.0.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it season four?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're like seven or eight years
into this shit, but it is 4.0.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ask me the madness behind my
decisions, but yes, 4.0 episode one is
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apologies for it being 18 minutes late.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was totally crashed out sleeping and I
never sleep until nine o'clock,
[SPEAKER_08]: like ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked on my phone and saw that Wade had
entered the room and I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh my God, dude, we got to hear from Wade
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear from everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a bunch of people that just came
into the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've got about 50 people that
just popped in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got best friend Farms in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Colin in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Etienne in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course we have Wade in the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how is everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Wade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good, given everything that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my camera turned off because I'm
in bed and not real handsome to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, learning about a new health
paradigm in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting used to the idea of not
enjoying full health and having to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: how to ask for help as a man who's spent
most of his life being ready and willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to help others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself in a situation where now I
need help with all kinds of things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: never expected to be in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real eye opening experience and
I'm actually feeling excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really the right word,
but for new opportunities, new chances to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about myself and about how our minds
work in the context of health and
[SPEAKER_00]: relations with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not easy, is it, Wade?
[SPEAKER_08]: I destroyed myself about four years ago
and I was unable to walk like almost at
[SPEAKER_08]: all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember just feeling that same way,
kind of like, wow, like I was ending up
[SPEAKER_08]: going to a lot of doctors and physio and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was and in my neighborhood,
there's a lot of elderly people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I noticed was that I was much
slower than them and I was unable to do
[SPEAKER_08]: things that they could do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had like I'd be walking into the
building and then, you know, like an 85
[SPEAKER_08]: year old guy would be like, excuse me,
and sort of shuffle by me while I was,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, moving one inch at a time
because I just so badly damaged my lower
[SPEAKER_08]: spine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really got me thinking the same
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just kind of like, wow, like this is a
really, it just gave me a glimpse into my
[SPEAKER_08]: potential future.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I, you know, if I can get there,
if I can, hey brother, right on,
[SPEAKER_08]: dude, good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got mad love for you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's, you know, I was even
talking to my wife about it the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this long driveway.
[SPEAKER_08]: It snowed about 20 times this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the minute it snows, we're both out
there shoveling like crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just kind of like, you know,
there's going to be a time where we can't
[SPEAKER_08]: do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wonder if our brains are going to
accept the fact that we can't do it or if
[SPEAKER_08]: we're just going to do it until we are
injured or hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then maybe we'll listen to our bodies
and be like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't think I can go out there and
shovel the 4,000 pounds of snow again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you have an incredible community
around you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that you yourself have been helping
people in similar situations that are
[SPEAKER_08]: unable to do things for themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've been such sort of a leading
energy in that help.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I often say it to my wife because
she's very much a helper.
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't take it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to understand that sometimes
the taking is allowing someone else to
[SPEAKER_08]: help, which is also giving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see that you have an amazing
community of people around you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that there's a little Facebook group
started for you, Compassion for Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just love seeing all the people that
are just like, I want to help.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll help with meal prep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll help.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would have expected it to go no
other way with a person of your vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting to me how we take
for granted our health and our opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the things that we love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this came up out of nowhere for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in September, I fractured a rib
sitting up in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, how does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, yeah, over the last
few months, I've broken a bunch of ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke my collarbone on the left side
here trying to open a childproof pill
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle and just fractured it clean in two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of cancer that I have is
called multiple myeloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it's certain type of blood
cells, bone marrow cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called plasmids and they make a
specific protein that anyway, my body's
[SPEAKER_00]: being very good at making lots and lots
and lots and lots of plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ends up happening is there's so
many of them, they blow holes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I look at, I've seen X-ray
photographs of my skeleton and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, I was shot with a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just hundreds of little holes in
the bones throughout my rib cage and spine
[SPEAKER_00]: and even my skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought I'd end up being a holy
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, yeah, that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the biggest drama at the
moment is I have this sort of crazy object
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can really see it,
but every time I get out of bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to strap myself into this thing
because my spine, several of the vertebrae
[SPEAKER_00]: in my spine are eroded to the point where
the X-ray, you can see my spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer surrounded by bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're concerned about, ended up
paralyzed from bone intruding on the
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing a lot of bed rest,
getting up when I can, eating well,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get lots of rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain's probably the biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain is such an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a sensation from the body to
stop doing what you're doing if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't stop, learn how to live
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a really strong sense in myself
that I will come through this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is a thing that, this is not my
end game, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very clear sense of I'm learning
about what it's like for people in my
[SPEAKER_00]: situation now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, I've spent years helping
people in this situation, but now I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, I feel like it's an
opportunity for me to help more people
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what this situation's like and
how those of us who look to plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms for healing opportunities can
really explore what's possible in our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical profession and the things that
they offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, for me, a lot, it comes back
to caring for oneself, learning to accept
[SPEAKER_00]: gifts, my beloved Monica pointed out to me
that she reminded me of all the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have accepted preparations I've made over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they never opened them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put them on their bedside and just
left them there, like never really used
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I'm being given that same
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people who are offering gifts to me
on a regular basis, but if I'm not willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to open those gifts and take advantage of
the offering that's been made,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like having that sitting on the
counter next to the bed instead of opening
[SPEAKER_00]: my heart to the gifts that are being
offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the hard part of acknowledging
all the love that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I appreciate you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stoked that you're here with us today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stoked that you turned your camera on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stoked that you're acknowledging all
the love that's come in your way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have any problems accepting any
of that love, I feel like Etan's cat is
[SPEAKER_08]: teaching us all a lesson on how to fully
accept love.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, holy shit, did you see that cat's
face just now?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was, I need to know lessons from your
cat.
[SPEAKER_07]: She loves Wade.
[SPEAKER_07]: And needless to say, Wade, thank you for
calling after your diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was both painful and loving to speak
with you, to remind you as healers now is
[SPEAKER_07]: your time to be loved and to accept it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for accepting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as we know, so many people we've
tried to help, as you said, don't open it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my best to Monica and all your support
team.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sorry to see you go through this,
but we're not above you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not below you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're beside you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we love you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need any time, you need to talk,
bitch, complain, you got my number.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, or just share love and just to share a
smile.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here for you there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But do your best, take it easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember you're human.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you've already immersed in
that, but just continue to accept the
[SPEAKER_07]: love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my cat sends her love too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Dr. Allison and Dr. Mark are both in
the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Mr. Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Dr. Allison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to send some love to Wade,
some healing vibes to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, I'm just, I was listening to him
and I was feeling so much love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, hopefully he can accept the
love that he's given to others that is
[SPEAKER_03]: coming back around to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually, I'm just going to pop in
for a moment because I am getting ready to
[SPEAKER_03]: go on tour with Tool for the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been preparing for this for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to be hitting Eugene,
Tacoma, Boise, Sacramento, and San
[SPEAKER_03]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, some Tool assisted therapy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be some Mushroom Tool
assisted therapy as well as some Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: assisted therapy going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tool as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing like a little Alex Gray and Adam
Jones artwork to, you know, feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: you're in church, literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different kind of church than Hash Church,
but church nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in full support of Tool Church.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that is for certain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And anything Alex Gray we embrace 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got my first Alex Gray calendar in 1991,
the Sacred Mirrors calendar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when I got turned on to Alex
and did a two foot double jump right into
[SPEAKER_08]: his, into all of it, which was,
yeah, I appreciate Alex.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate Tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Alex, actually the first event
I ever did was the 50th anniversary of
[SPEAKER_07]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_07]: In San Francisco at the Unitarian Church
in 1993.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Alex brought all his artwork and set
it up in this, in the center of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Unitarian Church.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: He set up the Sacred Mirrors.
[SPEAKER_07]: He set up all his paintings, not just
Sacred Mirrors.
[SPEAKER_07]: He set up a whole bunch of his paintings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the first time I had one ever
seen his work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, it was live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three, a lot of that shit's fucking large.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, cause I had been to Dali.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever been to the Dali museum,
shit's really small.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you never know what you're going to get
when you see an artist and to see his work
[SPEAKER_07]: on full display.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, yeah, that was, that's an artist
I've followed ever since, needless to say,
[SPEAKER_07]: cause it touched my heart and my soul and
everybody who was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people were tripping 50th
anniversary of LSD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were just in the center with the,
with that art.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just that connection never escaped
my soul.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope the experience is wonderful and
transcending, Dr. Cause yeah, I love to
[SPEAKER_07]: see them many a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they always put on an amazing
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just watch the drum solos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Danny Carey is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: My best friend and I have been going to
see Tool for the past 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they, you know, and actually
during COVID March 12th, we were at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Portland show and we were supposed to go
to Eugene and beyond and it got canceled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided to take a week and just go
on tour as, you know, best friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, and my step kids going to go to
the Tacoma show for her first rock
[SPEAKER_03]: concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, she's going to be ruined.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, having Tool as her first concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's completely insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was Iron Maiden and Twisted Sister.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was able to find some better
experiences down the road, but I'll tell
[SPEAKER_08]: you Twisted Sister in like 1986 was some
serious shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want it to, they weren't going
to take it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just weren't anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to make sure I said,
hi, I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been thinking of y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been judging the Washington craft
cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm judging Rosin and I'm also judging
BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I'm so disappointed in the
fact that BHO people are using CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if y'all have talked about it
at all, but I know Oregon has outlawed the
[SPEAKER_03]: use of CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has not happened in Washington and
nearly every entry that I'm smoking is
[SPEAKER_03]: CRC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Mark looking through the top of his
glasses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like he's got something to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they outlaw CRC?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a filtration stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't call it CRC and then you
could still do a filtration through some
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the way it tastes at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can taste it in the back of
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know whether it's the diatomaceous
earth that I'm tasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or any of the other chemicals or bleaching
agents or whatever it is that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: using in their columns, but it doesn't
taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It completely takes away from the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you, BHO never quite got
back on its feet after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosin knocked it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that it's like,
and I remember Johnny B did a video called
[SPEAKER_08]: the death of BHO.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember being like, holy shit,
I'm glad I didn't make that video.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause the BHO community already kind of
hated me, but fuck, I'll say it was
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly a partial death.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was a blow, like a blow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never forget like Giddy up being
like, ah, fucking BHO will always be
[SPEAKER_08]: better than Rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too hot and it's burnt.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, where did that fucking guy
go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick Bradley's in there saying Oregon
didn't outlaw CRC, they outlawed
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: They outlawed CRC media.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I know like I was just in Hawaii and
you can't even get any type of BHO
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction there.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, they have just started doing
Rosin and their Rosin was fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to actually give major props to
Maui Grown and what they're doing there
[SPEAKER_07]: for pressure and heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the quality of the Rosin was first
rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like $76 a gram retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I may be wrong on that, but it's still
expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, the quality is
getting better and being a veteran,
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a discount, but still the prices are
still outrageous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got a discount.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Rosin and bubble hash,
as all of y'all know, are just,
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to always be superior.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: To each its own.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the idea of everything being
available.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always loved the idea of,
you know, even things that I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: interested in, there's other people that
have a great interest in that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I will fight for people's rights to
have BHO if that's what they want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just, I'm just pretty happy with my
full melts and my Rosins, but to each
[SPEAKER_08]: their own for certain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a wonderful plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just feeling like if it's a
sacramental, you know, sentient being,
[SPEAKER_11]: it should stay that way all the way into
the body.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you put a toxic chemical into
something to transform it, to make it
[SPEAKER_11]: somehow more available to the market makes
zero sense on a spiritual level.
[SPEAKER_11]: And on an herbal level, people can do what
they want, you know, and they will.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's fair, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just like to point out that cannabis
is possible to be a sacred sentient being.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the medicine that comes out of it can
do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can change lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the purer it is,
the better it is on your microbiome and
[SPEAKER_04]: your.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said, Josh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, I used to always be
amazed at like how people could take
[SPEAKER_08]: isopropanol or another poison,
as you call it, create this extract and
[SPEAKER_08]: then like cure cancer out of their body
with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's, there's gotta be something
going on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like regardless, like I can't tell you how
many people I know that did that with like
[SPEAKER_08]: ISO and butane oil and just taking it and,
and, and ridding their body of disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to think that the power of cannabis
is greater than the power of the chemical
[SPEAKER_08]: extracting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems to hold over right,
right to the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I get that the purity, like I'm,
I'm a pure guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love, I very much love the full melt
bubbles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm always like, you know,
if my mom got some cancer or something,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd want to send her like my best full
melt, you know, I, I probably wouldn't go
[SPEAKER_08]: buy her BHO.
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, you know, it's hard to
buy 30 grams of full melt BHO or 60 grams
[SPEAKER_08]: or, you know, to have that stash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas at one point in time, people
really figured it out with BHO and,
[SPEAKER_08]: and that, and ISO, there was just,
you could buy enough of it where it was
[SPEAKER_08]: like, Oh, someone so needs like 60 grams,
you know, to start their regimen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could just access it and trying to
find 60 grams of full melt bubble would be
[SPEAKER_08]: like, I don't know, $6,000, $10,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love, I love the idea of people using
what they have access to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the meantime, let's make sure they
have access if, you know, it's your vision
[SPEAKER_08]: to have the best cleanest, best for your
biome product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then we got to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you got to grow the weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to make the hash and we got to make
it available, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: So come on, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if you're trying to see,
I think if we're trying to correct
[SPEAKER_11]: disease, like maybe smoking, it isn't the
actual method anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably move away from that whole entire
modality, you know, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_11]: like correct, you know, a chronic illness.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the beauty of this fractal
medicine is that we have this ability to
[SPEAKER_11]: transform it into different ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, there's, there's,
there's a lot of ways to, to live out
[SPEAKER_11]: there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and I would like to just give my love
at this moment to Wade, because I haven't
[SPEAKER_11]: yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just really acknowledge your whole
entire path.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything that you've always been about
has always been a breath of, of life to me
[SPEAKER_11]: and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything that I've ever seen you say,
everything that I've in your presence,
[SPEAKER_11]: Monica, as your partner, your whole entire
way of being the way of bringing forest
[SPEAKER_11]: into it and collagerious and your support
of his, you know, that, of that whole
[SPEAKER_11]: entire network is, is life changing and
life transforming.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you, and I also want to be as
Kelly too, also there any minute of any
[SPEAKER_11]: day.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can't be there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can't be there.
It can't be there.
It can't be there.
It can't be there spiritually.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do probably a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to do everything we can to
continue to send life.
[SPEAKER_11]: Love and.
[SPEAKER_11]: And courage and strength to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I just want to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't, the words are not enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: To express the feelings that I have that
we all have in our body for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of what I think so much of what we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this whole circle of people
represent similar flavors as what I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of what we do is you put it
out there because it's an expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because you think it's going to bring
some sort of fame or recognition or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's, and so deep appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, you, you and Kelly and the whole
dragon fly earth family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really a breath of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first found your work and what you
were doing, it made so much sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I love the, the way in which
you call out the spirit of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of the spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wholeness of that plant and the
various ethnogenic compounds that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring and learning more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm taking full advantage of some of the
CBD capsules you guys are making and
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing it with cannabis,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just deep appreciation for
this whole network of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what he's holding up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got him right here next to the bed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to visualize that there's old
growth intelligence in there because of
[SPEAKER_11]: the polypores that are growing in that
intact environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the largest intact environments of
all of British Columbia are infused into
[SPEAKER_11]: that oil, along with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the power of cannabis,
of course, and other herbal medicines.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like you got maybe a,
a foam is foam and serious or some kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: an artist cock there potentially Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and it does have an intelligence
beyond our current wisdom, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I, in the side, we do understand it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that's why it works so well and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it is, it's all of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a red belted conch.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one that's the most prolific
in, in, in the Northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the world has that red belted
conch and it grows on fir trees,
[SPEAKER_11]: pine trees, birch trees, rarely,
but sometimes hemlock trees.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they call it, you know, this,
it's just a powerful medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's even stories, lore about native
peoples in on the, on the British
[SPEAKER_11]: Columbian coast, you know, trading with
Chinese, you know, for 2000 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Lee Miracle is an amazing storyteller,
native woman from Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone should know about her.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's talking about ginseng coming
from, from the Chinese, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: 2000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they, and her tribes and her
native people never changed the name.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just call it ginseng.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it came from them 2000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And parts of that remnants do grow in the
forest.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you find ginseng around here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love the idea that as long as there
has been humans, there's been trading of
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, to me, that's really
powerful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like that we're keeping that
happening today in this modern world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when, when a person says, I'm
interested in plant medicine, I think
[SPEAKER_11]: they're saying I'm interested in spirit
medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: As well, because the plant has a spirit
and the spirit comes from the environment
[SPEAKER_11]: and the interaction between the human and
that environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where the magic comes from.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's where pyramids are built
or things beyond the human power.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I like to hold the space for miraculous
healing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also just, you know, conscious,
conscious living, you know, just being
[SPEAKER_11]: conscious, you know, as best you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe in this moment, I would like to
take, take a moment of silence because in
[SPEAKER_11]: the, in our family, in the last week,
we had a death of a, not only a DEM pure
[SPEAKER_04]: family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he freeze?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got internet like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're back, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We missed most of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got to.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_11]: His sister runs the farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a family farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing people.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been, they won the regenerative
Canada's farm in Oregon, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: a few years back at the cultivation
classic.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're, you know, family members of,
of green source gardens and Nick and Liz.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and it was, you know, the random sad
death and they found them in his,
[SPEAKER_11]: in his boat, you know, on the river.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and so we're putting our,
our, our, our emotions and our,
[SPEAKER_11]: our heart space to Daniel, to the family
and to the farm, to anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: that's guiding him and his trans
transformation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our heart goes out to Daniel.
Thanks
[SPEAKER_08]: for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cut out for the first little bit,
but definitely got clear towards the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Daniel's family and the whole
DEM pure family.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's heavy duty for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dying on a boat, floating on a river.
[SPEAKER_08]: Humans, we die.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of, I'd love to spend a,
send a special rest in peace to a long
[SPEAKER_07]: standing Hempi who passed this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name Steve Levine.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on the hemp industry association
board.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe he actually planted hemp
seeds on the DEA's lawn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the sweetest, most loving Hempis
started the Santa Barbara Hempi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp company was always out educating
people for the last three decades on hemp,
[SPEAKER_07]: just a nonstop tireless, awesome person.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Steve's living out of Santa Barbara
rest in peace, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you on the other side,
but you were an inspiration of pride and
[SPEAKER_07]: your smile was unrelenting and the world
is a little, a little less brighter
[SPEAKER_07]: without you in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said, Tiana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Randomly enough, Steve was one gentleman
whose paths mine and his never crossed in
[SPEAKER_08]: the 30 years that we were both involved
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew who he was, but we had never
interacted, which is just fairly rare for
[SPEAKER_08]: me in this sort of community.
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually bump into most, most folks like
that, that are lifers that are,
[SPEAKER_08]: that are a 100% dedicated to the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, another cannabis warrior has gone
to the other side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Puffa.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really quickly on a positive note,
I'd like to just shout up Brian at best
[SPEAKER_11]: friend farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of it's positive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would like to say, but,
and Brian from best friend farms in the
[SPEAKER_11]: last week, two weeks has become pure
certified and his farm is, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's coming alive over the last few
years, you know, and the whole Maine
[SPEAKER_11]: community, you know, is, is really doing
their work to try and make the world a
[SPEAKER_11]: better place.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, uh, just really stoked about
Brian and the intention you're putting
[SPEAKER_11]: into your products and your farm and,
and the transformation of growing all,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the food and bringing in
diversity, you know, working with hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: farmers, local organic, you know,
cultivation, uh, certification groups and
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can tell us more, but, you know,
I think it's really, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: Maine's a, you know, I don't want to call
it a sleeper state because every state's
[SPEAKER_11]: doing a lot, but Maine's doing a lot of
interesting stuff over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and I know Colin, you're doing a lot
of stuff traveling all over the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're in Maine now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So big up Colin, big up Johnny B on the
push jumps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Glad to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The medicine food come inherently for
Mainers here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's one of those things like I
grew up in the home with both and,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, you know, people were quieter before
now, but it's, it's some of the,
[SPEAKER_09]: one of those things that this state here,
uh, you know, has the, the landscape for
[SPEAKER_09]: it too, where we're not, you know,
we're cold, but it's not so cold enough to
[SPEAKER_09]: kill off a lot of the blights through the
winter and create, you know, good top soil
[SPEAKER_09]: continuum for the next year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we just have a lot of water here,
uh, like Michigan and like you guys have
[SPEAKER_09]: up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually thinking on a lot lately
when it comes to, uh, perhaps a hashed
[SPEAKER_09]: terroir or a turp terroir, when you're
looking at ambient humidity or moisture,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, surrounding when you kind of maybe
isolate or look down to the resin or the
[SPEAKER_09]: gland and how it would exist in what would
be maybe a moisture bath versus a very dry
[SPEAKER_09]: climate, which is more conducive for a
heavy flower density, healthy flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to bring that up a
little.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, you know, Maine's doing a lot of
good things with the medicine and with the
[SPEAKER_09]: hash and such, and starting to pay
attention to some of that happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to just talk about it a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk about hash war and the word
that you just invented.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, can we please make sure that it
doesn't go past us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You came up with hash war.
[SPEAKER_09]: That hash war.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the, the role on that, on that
phrasing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking terroir hash war.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard of the, the next year I have a
sticker from Northern California,
[SPEAKER_11]: the terroirist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the terroirist.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's, there's being a terroirist and,
and, and big enough your hash war.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I like hash war.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like hash war because it, it also could
include not only, you know, the terroir,
[SPEAKER_08]: the outside, but the indoor sort of aspect
of it, which, you know, maybe there's,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't your hash war and your terroir
person have to work together?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to be close friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to smoke together.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd have to take into effect the air
war, you know, because the air that's
[SPEAKER_11]: happening is crucial.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it depends on your oxygen war,
you know, it has to be at saturation
[SPEAKER_07]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's around the same latitude,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't, isn't Maine like at the same
latitude as BC?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to picture that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be like Northern California?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's coastal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the same thing over
there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, the bottom, so like Ontario,
Hamilton, Ontario, is 43 parallel,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is the same as Eugene, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_11]: You would never guess that Hamilton,
Ontario is the same latitude as Eugene,
[SPEAKER_11]: Oregon until you look it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you're like, oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like, that's why there's like the,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Niagara on the lake is a town south of,
you know, on Toronto.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, they have huge hectares filled
with, with greenhouses and tons of growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some of the original Canadian
LPs were in those, those areas,
[SPEAKER_11]: but someone should look it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's Maine?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, some of that, some of that Southern
Ontario resin, like some of the best full
[SPEAKER_08]: melt I've ever seen grown outdoors in
Canada comes from not too far from that
[SPEAKER_08]: area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maine has some extremely talented growers
up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I'm really impressed with the,
not only the camaraderie, but also the
[SPEAKER_06]: selection and the individuality that
everyone brings to the table here in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of their growing, you know, it's,
it's, it's rare to see so much fire on the
[SPEAKER_06]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just looked up Portland, Portland,
Maine is 43.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, that's low.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: 42nd, 43rd parallel.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard 42nd being at the 51st parallel
is like hardcore.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's a different like step of cold
and hardcoreness.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's why we might be getting all
this snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three feet on my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much snow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to do with the moisture level,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moisture level might have
something to do with not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir for growing, but for, for hash
making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I, I, making could be very,
very different at different levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that the, do you think that
the, the, would it be that the,
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe a fuller terpene expression,
perhaps if it has a more of a bath of
[SPEAKER_09]: moisture around for it to express every
aspect of that and that fraction of the
[SPEAKER_09]: resin, anyone know?
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I would, I've seen a lot of weed over
the years, not like, oh, I've seen a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, we, we are up in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: We go down all over all kinds of contests
everywhere and definitely found that,
[SPEAKER_11]: and even in California and Oregon,
people use shade cloths in the middle of
[SPEAKER_11]: the day and the, and the intense heat
because the resin heads, like they get
[SPEAKER_11]: closer into the bud.
[SPEAKER_11]: You might say, oh, there's a lot more
resin heads because you have a bigger
[SPEAKER_11]: flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the end, you might even have higher
yields in California, but you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: for example, California, let's say,
for example, but, you know, up in British
[SPEAKER_11]: Columbia or up in the farther North where
the bulbs get more, they're getting more
[SPEAKER_11]: identified.
[SPEAKER_11]: The, they, the flower isn't as tight and
the way that the, the hash, the heads
[SPEAKER_04]: knock off in the,
[SPEAKER_11]: or not, it's just in these areas,
you can get a more full expression in
[SPEAKER_11]: certain, in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be harder, it's harder to grow
though, because you don't get,
[SPEAKER_11]: in some ways it doesn't express the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to use a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot is that's a huge story.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a huge story.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why in some cases we use
greenhouses, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause we get the best expression because
we're capturing the heat of our Northern
[SPEAKER_11]: climate and finishing it off before the
cold nights.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we try and play around with cold nights
around here, there's not a turp to be
[SPEAKER_11]: seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: The, the, the, the plant stops growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course we have outdoor varietals that
[SPEAKER_11]: the resin heads are big and make for,
and in some cases, even more greasier
[SPEAKER_11]: style hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're finding here actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a funny, it's interesting because
the hash game has kind of changed a lot to
[SPEAKER_09]: where it goes to, you know, full melt or
raw.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the outdoor main one, the ego
clash in California this year,
[SPEAKER_11]: that, that says something says one thing
or two, you could figure out what they
[SPEAKER_11]: are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I find on the East coast predominantly,
you know, to not, not to put this versus
[SPEAKER_06]: anything, just in terms of difference in
climate, having that moisture during your
[SPEAKER_06]: cure or your, your drying process,
it really truly does help retain a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the, the volatiles that are there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It, it, and it seems that there's almost
a, a more control that you can bring over
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole process and itself that produces
a more, a robust profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's something that I,
I've, I've really noticed over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I truly believe that the climate up in
Maine up here is really conducive to super
[SPEAKER_06]: terpy varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's really due to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting a lot of big resin heads
too, like in the 120 range, like yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: what Joshua said, really, really greasy
terpy, greasy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a big, big extra big dump,
especially in the greenhouse later finish
[SPEAKER_09]: that can go to full maturity, but we're
seeing on the 120 micron, like almost
[SPEAKER_09]: overpowering the 90 by, by two.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the 160 on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you do see one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've gotten full mount right up to
190.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I went in years ago, I went to Lugano
to run material.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, I took a picture of the
hashes with their microns written down to
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was kind of a, not a very good
picture at the time, but it got printed in
[SPEAKER_08]: red eye magazine because it was sort of
like from the 25 micron to the 190 micron,
[SPEAKER_08]: every single grade melted and bubbled.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, substantially too,
not like one was a sizzler and the other
[SPEAKER_08]: ones were melting like ice cubes,
but they were all like ice cubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, I haven't really seen anything
like it since I have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_11]: We definitely don't get a lot of 160 and
are off our farm for whatever reason it
[SPEAKER_11]: is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll put it in there just to clean it
up and make it sweet for what's below,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, so the 220, 190, 160,
just to keep it like super clean down
[SPEAKER_11]: below.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll, we'll go through that effort,
but we don't get a lot out of the 160.
[SPEAKER_11]: We play around with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember who was talking,
but they were even talking about 190 and
[SPEAKER_08]: possibly using a 250 instead of a 220
because they thought the 220 was capturing
[SPEAKER_08]: heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember reading this conversation
and being like, okay, that's, those are
[SPEAKER_08]: like really big heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Marcus, we talked about that a bit
where I was asking, would it make sense to
[SPEAKER_06]: add another bag there?
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a 250 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to have 250 and not too many people
needed it, but just recently there was
[SPEAKER_08]: another conversation, not me or you,
a group of guys talking about how they
[SPEAKER_08]: were capturing all these heads in their
one nineties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they thought that they were losing
some in their two 20 and they ended up
[SPEAKER_08]: getting a two 50 and finding heads in
their two 20 and not saying it's
[SPEAKER_08]: impossible, but it's just a, it's neat to
see people are doing things that I've
[SPEAKER_08]: never really seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to mention, even with the
SIFT, I've been using your 304 screen and
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of the heads I'm finding on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had the COAs come back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually quite high in THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_10]: So going with those lower screens.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 45 microns.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be like, should be,
if you purify them in the 40 to 60,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe even 65 range.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a 42 micron yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I meant THC per cent.
[SPEAKER_08]: But your 305 is about a 45 micron screen.
[SPEAKER_08]: 50, maybe closer to 48 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy belated birthday, Johnny B and great
job on your 50 pushups there a day there,
[SPEAKER_07]: sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outstanding job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your consistency was a thing to
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing a hundred pushups a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do now up to 28 was my max.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm getting up there considering before
my fall, I did 35 at the bus stop on that
[SPEAKER_10]: one June 24th, June 22nd of 2025,
2005.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my goal is to get to 50 pushups by the
end of my 50th birthday.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got all of this year, basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: So join me a hundred pushups, a hundred
sit ups, a hundred crunches a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, you were doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of other guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: But even I started with two pushups,
guys, like, and then you can do two an
[SPEAKER_10]: hour, then do five.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep growing until you get there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to do pushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was happy to do it with you,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't, uh, didn't promote it like you
did, but I think I sent you the odd video
[SPEAKER_08]: of Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing my pushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there he goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's doing pushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started getting into a pushup.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started getting into pushups as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And keep going, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeez, we can see you somehow.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can see you taking those pushups right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ended up hurting my elbows and I hate to
say it, but I ended up hurting myself from
[SPEAKER_11]: doing, doing the pushup.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't just in the last month.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been kind of taking it on the last
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks guys for the motivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my second most pushups.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to get to 28, but I was like,
ah, don't want to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Never.
[SPEAKER_08]: As, as Josh is telling us about hurting
himself doing pushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that, dude?
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn your fingers in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I realized I can get better pushups with
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do wider and it's the book that I'm on
how to help with chronic pain is through
[SPEAKER_10]: pushups, sit ups, walking, walk backwards,
retrain your mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Breathing exercises.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I do every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, walks every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone just named your shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny, Johnny B's pushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny B's pushups.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the brief?
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the breathing exercises you're
doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I'm walking, I breathe into the
nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hold for four seconds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do that while I'm walking.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do that every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been doing that since March 6th.
[SPEAKER_10]: And well, so you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think everybody can see the change.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I just made that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just decided, I'm like, Hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: All it was walk up the door, you know,
and every day got a little bit better and
[SPEAKER_10]: every day I felt a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm with you guys feeling
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time for a good shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing this for a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can start any time you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing a hundred crunches, a hundred
sit ups on a hundred pushups a day for the
[SPEAKER_10]: next hundred days.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that will lead in for the next 10
years, then 25 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: See, once you start getting going,
mine was 30 days that I had a 90 day
[SPEAKER_10]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did my 50 pushups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm going to just keep doing it guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause the only way to get through pushups
is to just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how we get through this
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can hear.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be healthy for your selfie.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was, I'm super like inspired by what
you're doing, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did the transformation insane,
you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then like there it's like the song,
your theme song is, ain't no stopping us
[SPEAKER_11]: now, you know, type thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't even see him.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's half gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm 150.2 pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been 150 pounds now for over three
and a half months and I've had my weight
[SPEAKER_10]: off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I found that happy medium.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't try for a weight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't set any goals.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just went to where my body actually
went.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now that I've done the research on my,
see my grandfathers and my grandfather's
[SPEAKER_10]: opas and my great ancestors were all
between 135 and 150.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is my natural weight through my,
through my heritage and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: My father was a posted picture of him in
1964.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was 145 pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is where I was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: So once you find your natural weight,
you just kind of want to being happy
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can eat whatever I want, but I,
I eat more water density foods and I pay
[SPEAKER_10]: attention to my health.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoke a lot of dabs too, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I did my biggest dab and I did my
most amount of pushups was just 28.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a huge dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I proved I went down to 28
pushups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pushups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: That name was made for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to take that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cushups.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mehdi won.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your medicine is a kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now the hundred kushup challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: A hundred kushup challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: I challenge you guys to a hundred kushups
for a hundred.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm doing burpees.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm past just the pushups.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm, I'm, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll work my way up to a hundred.
[SPEAKER_10]: On September 2nd, I did two pushups and
that was, I mean, I mean, and it's been a
[SPEAKER_10]: long haul.
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't even do a pushup.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody knows it broke my neck,
shot in my arm, everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they said, I would never do that
again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said I wouldn't, I'd be in a
wheelchair when I was 50.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doctors lied to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, even scarier.
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably believed it, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the whole thing is, is they make you
believe things to believe in yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the most important part when you're
going to die.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, I was listening to one
talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, you know, I'm sorry, but you're
not going to die.
[SPEAKER_10]: They should say, I can no longer help you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have to go find some other help.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't tell you you're going to be in a
wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I can only help you at this
point.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can help some, someone else might be
able to help you live this better quality
[SPEAKER_10]: life that you're looking for, you know,
and you can do it for yourself because
[SPEAKER_10]: that's what I do every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that's what I need to do for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't listen to your doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they gave me five years to live in
1991.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said it would fucking addictive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, saved my life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got me off a pharmaceutical drug to the
point of today because I use cannabis for
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I need to, I use it for
relaxation and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_10]: entertainment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does all those needs for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_10]: How it gives me all of those needs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Relaxation, entertainment, fun,
joy, friendship, community.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I want to try this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm puffing it right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: No wonder I feel so good and I'm mildly
entertained.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started jump roping because my arms were
hurting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I started looking up all this
jump roping challenges and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I started seeing this,
a lot of stuff that was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you do like a thousand jumps a day,
you completely transform your body.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he started seeing all this
beautiful dancing styles and all this like
[SPEAKER_11]: timing things and stuff and all these
different kinds of ropes and everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I was been kind of enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was, and then I, and I heard this
thing on the radio and whether it's,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's kind of weird, but like, uh,
in China, they said that every child has
[SPEAKER_11]: to be able to jump a hundred times in
order to go to school.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I was like, can I jump a hundred?
[SPEAKER_11]: Times in a row in a minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it has to be in a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might not make it like from different
countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you just were like, Hey, we're going to
take you and go to first.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I can't, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it turns out the school is just
being healthy and being able to jump and
[SPEAKER_11]: being able to walk.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I started looking at all these
workouts and these like military workouts
[SPEAKER_11]: and these, these like Murph workouts and
all these challenges.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, Jesus Christ, do these
guys know about farming?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because all the time that they spend in
the gym and all this time they spend
[SPEAKER_11]: working out underneath bars and sweaty
gyms.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, have you guys ever heard of like
Hugo cultures?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause like a shitload of effort could be
used on transforming your land.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm telling you what, if you want to
put that much effort into being healthy,
[SPEAKER_11]: you might as well get some fucking food
out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That you're breathing that soil biome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that air, dude, you hit a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Outdoor, Hugo, Hugo culture gyms,
like come build my farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just built a whole goji berry bed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next thing you know, like, well,
oh wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: All these guys drink goji berry drinks,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could like grow them and then drink
them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you'd be stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just I just, I love that flip.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like, I kind of have a hard time in
between shoveling the driveway,
[SPEAKER_11]: fixing things.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a hard time getting the workouts in,
but I'm still good because it's all part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the life yoga that it takes to be well.
[SPEAKER_04]: True story, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: True story.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should go back to talking about the
size of the trichome.
[SPEAKER_08]: The trichome heads and the greasiness and
the dryness and the different
[SPEAKER_08]: environments, because I don't know if I
was done with that conversation there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely was inspired to hear Johnny B's
story and was stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, let's see if we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is someone going to make a 420 micron bag
now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The 420 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing how little innovation there
really is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even myself, all I did was add
some bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like in the long run, I'm kind of
waiting for the next big thing here to
[SPEAKER_08]: happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosen was amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fucking pretty gigantic for an
act.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it goes to show you, too, like,
you know, there's direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know there's people that call
bullshit on Phil's story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no reason not to believe Phil's
story about him just, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: pressing out the the hash in parchment to
make dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was, you know, definitely remember
Nicky T.
[SPEAKER_08]: doing that and that whole Colorado crew
doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jibs and Ken Wall and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's just neat that at one point in
time, he ran out of hash and for some
[SPEAKER_08]: reason was driven to put a bud into the
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's amazing, too, that people knew
that concept from years past when they
[SPEAKER_08]: were, you know, pressing hash and oil was
was gooping out of the filter bags and
[SPEAKER_08]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were collecting it and saving it.
[SPEAKER_08]: For their heads, but not enough to
actually have the gear turn in their brain
[SPEAKER_08]: to make that an available thing or a
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can see how how this changes
everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people communicating and sharing
information through this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So many people were able to get eyes on
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember in the cannabis industry
and community that Rosen was the first
[SPEAKER_08]: thing to spread on Instagram like wild
fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: I froze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last four years since it's been
created, how many machines are actually
[SPEAKER_07]: out there in companies that are actually
processing and making machines,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does even one go about figuring out
what machine to get nowadays?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas four years ago, they didn't even
exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you have your choice of selection
depending on your production model.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: People watching that here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, we were in Barcelona and,
you know, Brian came out and actually made
[SPEAKER_07]: it with us while we were in the Hash
Museum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now here we are years later and
there's literally machines to press your
[SPEAKER_07]: tonnage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite amazing just the adaptability
as well as where legalization or accepted
[SPEAKER_07]: adult youth in various countries and
states have allowed industrial personnel
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as chemical chemists to start
playing with this plant that we have never
[SPEAKER_07]: had that opportunity prior and that are
taking it really seriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could definitely see some other
horizon benchmarks on the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the note... Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny B's got the first rosin maker out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it went from hair
straighteners to a hand press,
[SPEAKER_06]: arbor press to hydraulic arbor press.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... Yeah, because everybody ran
out and started pressing and destroying
[SPEAKER_07]: their girlfriend's hair straightener to
where they're like, you better go get your
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking own now, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I mean, you know, now it's not
about throughput anymore, just about,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, quality selection and,
you know, your personal intuition as to
[SPEAKER_06]: how you want to make your hash and what
you want to select.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's just so much, you know,
pressure and temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Drupal will always be connected to the
amount of people you want to touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's easy to do small batch and you can
be very comfortable in small batch,
[SPEAKER_08]: but trying to do large batch, small batch
quality and caliber with the living soils
[SPEAKER_08]: and the proper growing, that is the true
challenge that in my opinion is why we're
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've also got the small screens,
you've got the pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got a whole series of new
technology that we've never necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: played with in the sense of, you know,
what micron screen are you particularly
[SPEAKER_07]: using for this type of genetic to actually
get this particular squish at what
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature, how long was your press?
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it's the lower the temperature
is still the, the safety of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause if you go too high, as you know it,
every temperature affects flavor,
[SPEAKER_07]: correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And not, not always, not always bad and
not always good, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, you can see it in the good
way, whereas maybe you've got a cultivar
[SPEAKER_08]: with some mono terpenes that aren't like
the most enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are going to pop off probably pretty
quick in the process, sort of showing a
[SPEAKER_08]: new bouquet that is now there,
the sesquas and the heavier terpenes that
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't volatize off quite so quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it works the other way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes people are like, Ooh,
I, I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It smelled like burnt popcorn,
this, that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't ever smoke rosin that smells like
burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure why people think that's what
all rosin is like.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually as nice as any extract that
you could do if it's done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what their experience was.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they had access to some crappy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they think it's crappy if they had
access to the quality rosin, even the
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff that I just recently saw in Hawaii,
you would be thinking twice and you
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't even utter those sorts of things
out of your mouth because the quality is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is at the nasal and passes right across
the palate now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think back to what Marcus was
saying, the supply chain is really
[SPEAKER_06]: important to note.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's like, if you don't have your
inputs down, you're, is you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: struggle to make quality material and
especially scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's just, it is impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and that's, that's the struggle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I, yeah, that's what we really
truly need right now is, is agricultural
[SPEAKER_06]: experience and horticultural experience to
merge ideologies to, to try to,
[SPEAKER_06]: to, you know, if they get, if that's going
to happen at scale, that's, that's the way
[SPEAKER_06]: it has to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also sort of, you know, the people who
run companies and have an understanding on
[SPEAKER_08]: how to do that, that's sort of corporate
aspect and whatever you want to call the
[SPEAKER_08]: rest of us, legacy, you know, roots,
the roots in the suits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you also need to kind of like,
there are things that they're really good
[SPEAKER_08]: at.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they stopped sort of doing it in
nefarious ways, it could, it, it,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like I said, it's, it's hard to
touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: That many people, I love the idea of being
able to help my friends and my local
[SPEAKER_08]: community and growing and, you know,
getting more and more people involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also love the idea of just being
able to say to anyone in my country,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can just go here and get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I hate the idea that people have been
feeling for so long that when I share
[SPEAKER_08]: something nice and I'm like, Oh,
look at this bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a six star.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's super nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just can't go and get some,
you know, cause that's what, when,
[SPEAKER_08]: if I see anyone's beautiful stats,
that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I froze up there for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the beauty of you teaching everyone
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, it is possible for a
lot of people to do even a four,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, plant thing in their house,
which tons of people do now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and it is true that more and more
people are beginning to make their own,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I get totally not to take away from
how the beauty of being able to go to the
[SPEAKER_11]: store.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that's even in France,
there's different reasons, but yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade, I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to tell you how much I loved
you and hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so, we have so much snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like such a journey,
almost like couldn't find our place right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're so snowed in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty wild, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the most snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen in the 26 years of living in
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we had one maybe like in 2002
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really huge winter,
but I think this one is surpassing it
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're just still in early January,
but it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the water that's happening in the
mountains and this kind of snow really
[SPEAKER_04]: seems to reset soil too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably be seeing different pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even some pests will probably go away and
you know, so the cycles continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be excited for spring and what
these heavy snows bring us.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_10]: I live in Abbotsford.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have the hellacious floods.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fought water for a while, but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you said, we need the water and stuff
like that, but that looks nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Mark's place.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a beautiful view there.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you, hopefully you don't get like
a mudslide.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the slides and all the things that are
happening with all this weather and all
[SPEAKER_10]: these big changes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we went from water like crazy to
minus weather to everything freezing to
[SPEAKER_10]: all this snow than the melts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in Ontario, I mean, I was out
there and I was like plus seven.
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be minus 40.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's going to be good out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we just got to everybody's got
to grow and share the snow.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great time to make hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like what, what we've done is okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the note of, you know, having large,
large trichome heads, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's the thing of like, Oh,
we're going to harvest the plant early to
[SPEAKER_11]: try and get the lighter colored hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the buds aren't going to be as
full.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they, you know, then that that's,
that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, you know, I don't, I don't agree
with that, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's some Instagram shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you notice that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then some of the best hash we've ever
made was upon Ganja Gill's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_11]: The snow was coming in and we just washed
hash straight out of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was starting to freeze for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plants were really nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just took plants and washed them
right in, in the actual greenhouse itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was amazing that the terpene
content on that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did it at night too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think that, you know,
there's, there's definitely harvesting the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant in the evening, you know,
the morning hours before the sun comes up
[SPEAKER_11]: and letting the trichomes mature as much
as they can.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just finding ways to wash them as
fresh as they can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two and a half month hang dry to see if I
can make some really good hash today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today's the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a bunch of different screens,
buds on some screens and make some hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope everybody makes some hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so like, honestly, I think this idea
of, of something fresh and interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: happened when, when color came into the
mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I don't, I think that it's good
hash is good hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't think there's the
education yet around hash and color and
[SPEAKER_06]: pigment and why it's a certain color.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know, you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, and it's, that's, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really important for people
to understand is that quality hash is has
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot to do with how the heads were grown
and how that resin was actually cared for
[SPEAKER_06]: before it became hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're, we're really just filtering
the plant material to collect that
[SPEAKER_06]: material.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are the unveilers of the flame.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, you know, as you've always
said, Marcus, it's, it's fire and fire
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how you grew that for that varietal,
if you let it go longer, you may have
[SPEAKER_06]: amber heads there and your hash just may
be amber.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might not be a bad thing
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's just, I'm sorry to
interrupt you, but do you think then fully
[SPEAKER_09]: mature?
[SPEAKER_09]: Colin and fresh frozen trap then would be
the most, the fullest terpene profile
[SPEAKER_09]: expression from the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any call on that or?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would, I believe at least maybe
the cannabinoid spectrum itself is
[SPEAKER_06]: immature at a more mature state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might have a larger spread of a
higher percentage point of these miners in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of these, you know, the volatile
chemicals there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't, I think it depends on the
variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot to be studied there
in terms of what meant to actually take
[SPEAKER_06]: something for the purpose of the terpene
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think there is a fall off point where
terpenes do peak and the, the terpenoids
[SPEAKER_06]: itself and all those, the volatiles do
start to fall off at certain weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but there's a lot to explore there in
terms of understanding that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it say this meeting is being recorded
when I came in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that kind of made me chuckle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, imagine like 25,
30 years ago, if I came into a room and a
[SPEAKER_08]: voice announced that the meeting was being
recorded, that's a, Oh, we would all left.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might've even got stomped out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but this meeting is being
recorded.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still the antithesis of my thought
and my upbringing from anything I was
[SPEAKER_07]: taught from using pagers and pay phones
and being described on the side streets
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, hustling and meeting in
bathroom stalls and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we are, you know, completely
comfortable and legal to the point where
[SPEAKER_07]: we're being recorded and we're talking
about the drugs and shit that we used to
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with, grow illegally, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, we really did change our
reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we?
[SPEAKER_08]: We did.
[SPEAKER_08]: We changed our reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know a lot of it still needs to be
changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's still people in cages and
all sorts of heinous shit going around the
[SPEAKER_08]: world.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not done, but the fact that it could
be done even on a small scale means that
[SPEAKER_08]: it can be done on a large one,
which is once again, why it's so important
[SPEAKER_08]: to do things on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everyone gets to enjoy the fruits of
our labor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, not only that Marcus, you were going
to cord your drug talk and you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: share it with the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Except Russia.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't fuck with my shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't let me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you can play bubble man's
world in Russia, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get letters every once in a while from
like Russian government saying that bubble
[SPEAKER_08]: man's world is not welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess China would say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say that we're all talking
about us changing, you know, our reality
[SPEAKER_02]: in the way that the industry is going in
the way that the community is talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about it more in the way that the world is
incorporating cannabis more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it really is just the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more that cannabis spreads,
the more ability that minds are open,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more minds that are open, the more
heart spaces that are open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we are doing is just stewarding
her into more and more doorways to make
[SPEAKER_02]: this world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just so amazing that plant
medicine just keeps showing itself as the
[SPEAKER_02]: cure all for both mental, physical,
emotional, communal, everything space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that this show and what you've
been doing for so long, Marcus is just
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing to allow the plant to go
through doors that it may have not
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise gone through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so much gratitude for everybody for
continuingly knocking at the doors,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that's everybody listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we continue to push this plant
forward and show her out in a good way and
[SPEAKER_02]: have healthy concentrates and healthy
conversations, better soil, then it's only
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make the world a better place
because then the plant is just doing what
[SPEAKER_11]: it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a better, healthy mind,
body and soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always talk about, you know,
all of the different ways to make cash and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to decompose, you know, like break it
all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it really just gets back
to the most important thing about hash is
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're ingesting it and that we just
continue to grow through the ingestion of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to have a bong hit right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy new year for Wade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this the first house?
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the new year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the growing into 2022.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at new innovations, new ways of
making hash and new ways of growing guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: The industry is changing so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome with light and technology and
all these.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to look at a rolling machine that
rolls like 10,000 joints a day or
[SPEAKER_10]: something.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was at the Lyft conference and seeing
this shit that's happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the future is kind of growing fast
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it is growing, but at the same time,
we're still dealing with prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm watching our Dragonfly people who are
using a Puffco peak.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I am correct in my understanding,
Puffco peak went out of business because
[SPEAKER_07]: of vaporizing can no longer be made.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, even things like that,
even as much as we take two steps forward,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're still taking a few steps back from
time to time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even those that have found a way for
ingestion for our methodology,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's different.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more portable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even they are still coming under attack
and persuasion and manipulations that
[SPEAKER_07]: still do not allow us to imbibe our full
freedoms yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's why we know it's not ignorant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's why we know it's not ignorance.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's straight.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the demons.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an agenda.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like we're ever going to open
their minds.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like not ever happening,
but they control the board.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's like a game of chess.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kelly kind of nailed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just there kind of opening all these
doors like, hey, cannabis quick through
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still suffering the whack-a-mole
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it shows you the persuasiveness of our
persuasion that we're actually making end
[SPEAKER_07]: roads through different access and points
through society.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that society is still trying to,
you know, still put it into its own
[SPEAKER_07]: pedestal or hide it away still,
as opposed to giving it what we actually
[SPEAKER_07]: crave, which is the freedom and the desire
for others to start being able to go
[SPEAKER_07]: beyond the Puffco peaks, to go beyond
these electric attachments, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_07]: to find the next better ingestion
methodology or modality that is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, again, we have to fight to
legalize even simple modality access,
[SPEAKER_07]: much less what we're actually imbibing and
putting in them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just interesting the steps that
we've had to continuously to take as we
[SPEAKER_07]: make our progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just reminders people eternal
vigilance.
[SPEAKER_07]: You still have to get out, speak voice,
write your letters, protest and do the
[SPEAKER_07]: things that got us here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ain't done yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are still in jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like the best thing we can do is
all of what Etienne just said.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also I'd like to just point out that
the Snodgrass family and the glass blowing
[SPEAKER_11]: industry from the very beginning in the
early 90s felt those exact same pressures
[SPEAKER_11]: where, you know, they started growing,
blowing glass, teaching everyone,
[SPEAKER_11]: all of a sudden at the center out of
Eugene.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next thing you know, there's serious money
being made and all of a sudden the
[SPEAKER_11]: government gets excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, they, they all of a sudden
couldn't, you know, people couldn't send
[SPEAKER_11]: glass state to state.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I see, you know, people are moving
here and there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think adaptability is the
actual thing that we need to learn how to
[SPEAKER_11]: be good at.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to be learn how to, we need to
learn how to be good at adapting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not, it's not survival of the
fittest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the survival of the most adaptable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's don't get whacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's whack-a-mole, then we're
whacking our own creations that we lift
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever is powerful right now,
we have given power to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we step back and we look at it and
we start recognizing what we want to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we don't want to feed,
that's just a really important question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about health and vitality
and wellness, of the earth, of the globe,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the people, of the residents of this
earth, then we need to talk about what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is that we're feeding that's a pathogen
and what it is that we're feeding that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, as a human
race, we've been feeding a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens and then we've been calling them
they.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is our own doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever they is, is because we've given
that power that money, that energy to
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is also, you know,
beating us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that now that it's 2022,
we really can set out our intentions and
[SPEAKER_02]: put our energy and our kindness and our
love towards the beneficials to colonize
[SPEAKER_02]: the beneficials to procreate, to
repopulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think that I'm super on that
notion of health and vitality and what
[SPEAKER_02]: that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it starts with each
individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just sitting with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the term resonance because it's the
resonance of the ways, but it's also has
[SPEAKER_11]: the word resin in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that brings you to hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you realize that the hash is just
a resonance of the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's it's kind of this
beautiful thing because the trichomes are
[SPEAKER_11]: crystals.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's that cosmic energy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk a lot about, you know,
you have to have a good, beautiful plant
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to have amazing hash and
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, that's the way it is in
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, humans expect six for
everything, but they put one star into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start putting six stars into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you're going to get six
stars out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you put in, you get out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like Johnny B in the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B has been putting in six stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he gets out six stars and it's obvious
and it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get what you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get what you deserve.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you work hard for it, then you get
what you deserve.
[SPEAKER_10]: So work hard for what you want in your
garden, in your life and anything that you
[SPEAKER_10]: do and you'll get what you deserve.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you only get one life.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm talking here and talking here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, just keep growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to get my garden today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to get out there,
taking some time off.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all super inspiring to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every single one of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that said, I've got to jump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus, thank you for holding space as
always.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone, thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wade, sending all my love.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish you well and keep us
updated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, Colin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had a power outage last week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize to everyone, but the no power
thing was a pretty big deal breaker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a generator, but I was like,
do I really want to get my computer and
[SPEAKER_08]: my, you know, Starlink up and running on a
generator?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just passed, but I'm glad we did one
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hang out for another 15 or 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anyone wants to end it with some
inspiration, something positive,
[SPEAKER_08]: something good, definitely sending love to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to add in kind of in line with
what Kelly was saying too, and getting
[SPEAKER_09]: back to like the restoration.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, I love what you're
doing with this group and how it goes out
[SPEAKER_09]: and resonates because it's bringing a lot
of heartbeat back to the culture,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is really needed so much these days,
it seems like for folk tale and folklore
[SPEAKER_09]: and to restore human faith and trust in
each other is to tell stories and report
[SPEAKER_09]: back from the human.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, the portal being the
cannabis plant to connect us together all
[SPEAKER_09]: ancient and wise, but I really,
really, really am thankful, feel blessed
[SPEAKER_09]: to be part of being able to share stories
from with the folks here and outward.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was very well said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And definitely in line with all the things
that Kelly said, which were just beyond
[SPEAKER_08]: inspirational and extremely well said as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just appreciate all of you guys and gals.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am very glad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't put a lot of time and energy into
building the channel per se these days or
[SPEAKER_08]: my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: It got disabled for the first time ever
recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was kind of like, I was like,
do I even want an Instagram?
[SPEAKER_08]: And other people like, oh my God,
like I would die if my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: I froze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I back?
[SPEAKER_08]: There I'm back.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, my Instagram got disabled.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, YouTube, I don't really put a
lot of videos up, but I do like it for
[SPEAKER_08]: this, for this group of people to invite
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we have here is special for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great group of people who listen and
watch.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I just have a deep appreciation
for all of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hash church is still a special little
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love the way you put it,
man, like bringing some heartbeat to the
[SPEAKER_08]: community dash industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that faith and humanity
thing is a big deal as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy to be a pessimist nowadays,
especially if you consume like bad media
[SPEAKER_08]: 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like just eating poison,
you know, 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not it's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what my message would be to everyone is
stay positive, get out into nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy plants, enjoy fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, try not to let the division
happen because there is a clear division
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of constantly, you know, this
tension.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's OK for the tension to be
there, but it doesn't have to be as tight
[SPEAKER_08]: as it is right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's loosen that tension.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love to Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love to Etienne, Josh and Kelly,
Dr. Mark, Brian, Johnny B and the folks
[SPEAKER_08]: that have left.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be enough for me, but I'll keep it
going for another 15 minutes so you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: can all have a chance to wrap up as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wade, Wade, is there anything that some
wisdom or anything you would like to
[SPEAKER_07]: impart to us as you've been in your new
headspace and mind space?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there some wisdom you'd like to share
with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that occurred to me
recently is all of the effort that over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years I put into understanding what's
necessary to create high quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of practices in the garden and
the soils that we built and the cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that we worked with and some of the
benefits that we saw from those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to realize that I want to bring
that same attention to detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: that same desire to understand what was
going on in this discussion like with
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, you know, why we see different types
of hash from different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: different moisture levels, et cetera,
et cetera, that whole exploration of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really feeling a deep commitment to
myself to understand my body more fully,
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand how it is that I like to
think of myself as someone who has lived a
[SPEAKER_00]: good life, who has always eaten well,
who has always pursued good works,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, walk in light, if you will,
that how I end up in a situation of having
[SPEAKER_00]: a cancer like this is fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to understand what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look back to one of Kelly's observations
about pathogens and allies and how we have
[SPEAKER_00]: put so much effort into creating pathogens
in our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: you adapt to what we've done to our
environment, what we've done to our
[SPEAKER_00]: zeitgeist, if you will, the entire sum of
all our experiences and one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really love the hash church
concept, the thing that we're doing here
[SPEAKER_00]: is bringing that light, each of us in our
own way, work hard to manifest that light
[SPEAKER_00]: within ourselves and in our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have done very good at getting that
word out into the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it feels to me like for me,
at least right now, it's important for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn inward and to really explore
what's happening for me and to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how what's happening for me is really to a
large extent happening for many people
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us are struggling with toxins of
one sort or another, be they from the
[SPEAKER_00]: media, from our food, from whatever,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it just feels like a time for me to
focus within and really understand more
[SPEAKER_00]: fully my process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Johnny B's observations about how
he's going about changing his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of us in our own way are pioneers,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our work over the years has been
really focused on pioneering, ending
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, helping people understand
what this plant and our various allies can
[SPEAKER_00]: do for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think it's at least for me,
it feels like it's a time for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand more fully what I can derive
from this for my own benefit, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: those that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that made any sense at
all, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all that's made all the sense in
the world, my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for sharing and being a guide in
a stage with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate your wise words of wisdom
and appreciate you greatly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And wish you nothing but healing,
love, and sustaining energy so that you
[SPEAKER_07]: can get back to how you were and where you
want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wade, I feel like that path inward is
the path of the true warrior.
[SPEAKER_02]: The path inward is the path that we're all
afraid to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: The path inward is the path that we're
forced to when we've done everything
[SPEAKER_02]: outward.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the work that you're doing is the
work that heals all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The work of you going inward heals the
collective consciousness to places that we
[SPEAKER_02]: all need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honor you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, my friend, my brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for doing the work that so many
of us need to do, doing the work that so
[SPEAKER_02]: many of us can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have so much love and so much honor for
you in all of the journeys that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: shared and you sharing that you're going
inward with your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the greatest gift that you can give all
of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And nourishing your own spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are all just awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wade, you give us that push and that
spirit and that drive and the stories that
[SPEAKER_10]: you've told and the messages that you have
given us over the House Churches and over
[SPEAKER_10]: time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like just today, you touched my heart and
I appreciate you so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so grateful to be able to sit here and
talk to you and everybody here and the
[SPEAKER_10]: power we have as a community, as this
inner circle that we've created over time
[SPEAKER_10]: and this growth that we have in different
parts of the world and what we do as a
[SPEAKER_10]: driving force.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're so much a big, huge part of
this and created a big inspiration within
[SPEAKER_10]: this community.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank you so much,
Mark and everybody here who's being just
[SPEAKER_10]: dedicated to this plan to come into these
House Churches.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like family, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are family and we're a family to
so many other people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank you all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And 2022, man, it's growth, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like freedom, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like freedom.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how I feel right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Freedom with you guys and freedom with
growth, Wade and Mark and everybody here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys give me tears, man, because I
love you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's just do this together,
man, because the power with this community
[SPEAKER_10]: is so strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look at where legalizations came
from and what's happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can feel the force within us now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just coming out and just going,
fuck yeah, let's do this, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: 2022, the way we got you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you, Mark, everybody here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like bomb rip, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me just saying, yeah, this is how
great I feel every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can all do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called decide, make a choice,
do it for yourself and everybody here,
[SPEAKER_10]: man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking love you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just had to say that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we all got this little bit of tears
because we all have inside of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have that force in you to just do
this every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I see it with every one of you,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just, I got to do bomb rip now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just tears of joy, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so good right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate you so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every one of you, all you guys in chat,
everybody out there is going to watch this
[SPEAKER_10]: over time.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys rock.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I love about that, Johnny,
is just saying that everything's an
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, hardships are an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, success is an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Divisions, you know, togetherness,
it's all an opportunity when, when we make
[SPEAKER_11]: it that way, you know, so let's,
let's just try and find the things that
[SPEAKER_11]: build us up and let's try and find that
commonality and come together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't try do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you say you can't, you're lying to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got that written on my wall.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I say I can't, I'm lying because you
can and never stop believing in yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think words are powerful guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at those keywords and change your
vocabulary, change your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to say, you know,
before we all ended it and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this isn't ending it or anything,
but so much love for Daniel in making his
[SPEAKER_02]: transition out of his body three days ago,
four days ago now, so much love to Lane
[SPEAKER_02]: Creek Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what an incredible,
soil lover, medicine maker, purely
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated to his family, to Dempure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, have gained an angel on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have gained so much in knowing him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to really put that love
out into the universal flow for the broken
[SPEAKER_02]: hearts over at Lane Creek Hemp in his
passing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, 2020, and that was such a
wonderful year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to thank you for all of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also a time of rebirth and there's a
lot of people pregnant right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we just want to really give
thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: That new life, you know, and that new
potential and that new, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity to learn from this wisdom,
you know, bringing in this new life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a brand new season that we've never
encountered before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting ready to have a brand new
season of 2022 of spring that we've never
[SPEAKER_02]: ever experienced before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can put whatever seeds in the ground
that we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can grow whatever it is that we want
to.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to sow the seeds of love
this year and bring in love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Mark, the man of few words today,
close this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on mute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, people like Wade are are
unique because.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you think just not even through
the collage network, but how many people
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken the words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowledge that this one human has
[SPEAKER_01]: and brought new genetics and new
understanding to what the plant can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Wade, you're a living
manifestation of the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it's hard to tell where
the plant ends and where Wade begins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, I mean,
hopefully all of this community that that
[SPEAKER_01]: has come to your support is part of the
healing energy that brings you back to
[SPEAKER_01]: where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the skeletal system is
underpinned by the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's been some very
important work done over in Israel to show
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hope by nurturing your
endocannabinoid system, it'll bring you
[SPEAKER_01]: back to health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, if there's anything I can
do or anything that this extended
[SPEAKER_01]: community can do for you, just feel free
to reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a low, low barrier to
reaching out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wade, last words, you want to say goodbye
to everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the love.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you, Wade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you, everybody.
