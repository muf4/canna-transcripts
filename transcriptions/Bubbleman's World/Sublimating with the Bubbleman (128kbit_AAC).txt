[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going there, Facebookers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've just been posting a bunch of
pictures today of Melty Bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have really been stoked on seeing
the pictures of Bubble, so I figured maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do a little video of sublimating
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just pull out a little bit here and
dump her into the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, generally, for the sublimator to give
an instant rip, you want to have the wand
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That heats the bottom of the bowl up,
and that way, when you put the material in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got my sublimator turned on hot
enough that it should still give a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: milky hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little slow going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sublimator gets hot enough,
it'll just milk right up, but still,
[SPEAKER_00]: that hit was super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I would only get probably one
hit from a hit like that in the bong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the sublimator usually gives me four
or five.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I really like about the
sublimator is lifting the wand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put hash or cannabis in there,
but you can also dab your solventless oils
[SPEAKER_00]: in these little dots here, in these little
holes that the sublimator comes with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, after five or six hits,
I can usually squeeze out a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little blob of oil, which I got one on
this nail here, and then it's just as
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as dropping that into the hole and
taking the hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the many reasons why the
sublimator is superior to all vaporizers
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, hash, and oil, all effortlessly,
all nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, bubble on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you soon.
