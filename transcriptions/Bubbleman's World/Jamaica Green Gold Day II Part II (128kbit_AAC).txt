[SPEAKER_14]: Music Overcoded says, don't interest value
media, don't interest value human rights
[SPEAKER_14]: groups, don't be the class persons who are
involved in these issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's on that perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: But where are we today?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking, talking, talking.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't look as a hawk on why I'm actually
here, because I respect the work and what
[SPEAKER_14]: he has supported the group that we work
with.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I really want to contribute to another
hawk shop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, for one, don't believe that going
to Jamaica is acting with any sense of
[SPEAKER_14]: urgency on this matter.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've said this to many of them,
so it's something I'm saying behind their
[SPEAKER_14]: backs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Understand the vast potential,
the magnitude of the potential that this
[SPEAKER_14]: industry is about.
[SPEAKER_14]: In people's minds, unfortunately,
it's about more people just walking down
[SPEAKER_14]: the road.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is just the release.
[SPEAKER_14]: The jury's office as to what, what,
how, the angle of people smoking,
[SPEAKER_14]: underage, habitant, how much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jury's office, and I'm going to get into
that today.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a few cockswellers in J.C.
[SPEAKER_14]: 6-4.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've not smoked properly in J.C.
[SPEAKER_14]: 1970s.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see any negative impacts on me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was 98.
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't call it me because I'm the J.C.
[SPEAKER_14]: old boy.
[SPEAKER_14]: But talking about the farming
implications, I think all of us,
[SPEAKER_14]: not just the farmers, all of us have to be
glad that this industry is protected for
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_14]: And protected for Jamaican farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I might actually exclude it,
but I am just amazed by something who
[SPEAKER_14]: called me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I welcome that interest, who walked up
to about 200 acres, about 500 acres,
[SPEAKER_14]: really not walking, when these things were
real, when the gate went black.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am just amazed to do what I would never
have thought of.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as you know, we have the Cannabis
Commercial Medicine Research Task Force,
[SPEAKER_14]: and we spawn the Gang of Future Growers
and Produce Association.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear the word future won't be with us
too long.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what are the farming implications?
[SPEAKER_14]: All we have to make sure it is protected
for the Jamaican farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have not contained a final
decision, but certainly from my mind,
[SPEAKER_14]: in the first three years, it has to be
restricted to restricted Jamaican farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has to be restricted in sacks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise those who want to grow 200
acres, 200 acres, 400 acres, will take
[SPEAKER_14]: over the industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: They too must be able to grow their five
acres.
[SPEAKER_14]: Until the Jamaican farmer understands the
industry from an international,
[SPEAKER_14]: legal, not from an international
perspective, but from a legal,
[SPEAKER_14]: international perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: It can't be that people should be allowed
to be farmers, should be allowed to grow
[SPEAKER_14]: 120, 200, 300 acres of this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly the people who need a product,
must contract Jamaican farmers to grow
[SPEAKER_14]: their product.
[SPEAKER_14]: Put their quality control experts,
give them the kind of seeds they want,
[SPEAKER_14]: but they should not be allowed to grow
more than their own research area.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they contract Jamaican farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: The farmers who supply must be able to,
through a property, own part of that
[SPEAKER_14]: enterprise.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that we are not just producers and
suppliers, but we earn from the finished
[SPEAKER_14]: product.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if hemp oil is not available,
that up to a month ago, I was told,
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know, I tell you all,
but selling more, an ounce of hemp oil,
[SPEAKER_14]: but selling more than an ounce of gold.
[SPEAKER_14]: We want our farmers not just to buy the
raw material, but we want them to benefit
[SPEAKER_14]: from the finished product.
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly the workers, we have to dust off
Esau, we have to get the products,
[SPEAKER_14]: employees, share ownership programs,
that they get preferential shares.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is not cost-firing companies to come
in and say, yes, grow the crop for us,
[SPEAKER_14]: and we make the finished product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not we, they make the finished
product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the finished product, these two make
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 times value added, 40, 50 times.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all we are doing is producing the raw
cannabis to give them.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have done that with two in the warm
crops.
[SPEAKER_14]: As we have seen.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this has to be different.
[SPEAKER_14]: How should the money be used?
[SPEAKER_14]: I start the support and somebody has to go
to public education.
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody has to subsidize development and
research.
[SPEAKER_14]: And somebody has to make sure some people
still grow food for us to eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: I say to you, it is not that threat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody starts to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_14]: In the same way we have the farmers
insisting on having tomatoes rotten.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is not what you want to grow,
it is what people want to buy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Future Growers Association is a
very important group.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have excellent leadership.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have a collective leadership.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have people who are not
restricted back in the political council.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Because as I said before, very early in
the day when I became chair, I would have
[SPEAKER_14]: been chair for more than three,
four months.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have, which has been a strict
case, that they are really studying the
[SPEAKER_14]: implications of this industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: We also want to make sure that most of the
things, even Jamaica, is finished
[SPEAKER_14]: products.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: But as I said before about cannabis,
and in many countries right now,
[SPEAKER_14]: they are selling their own stuff as
Jamaican Herb.
[SPEAKER_14]: As I call it, they used to sell things as
Blue Mountain Coffee.
Right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And people are marketing and branding all
kinds of stuff as Jamaican Herb,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is not authentic Jamaican Herb.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is a marketplace for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the oversight committee, the criteria
must be so plain and straight for those
[SPEAKER_14]: who want to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: That once you meet one, two, three,
four, five, you'll get your license to
[SPEAKER_14]: grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: The body must feel that you know somebody,
not a politician, not a big man.
[SPEAKER_14]: It must be open, like the average
Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_14]: The man that you see taking clothes and
the legs, right, can grow his stuff.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, I believe if the Jamaican people
are not mobilized, mobilized to push this,
[SPEAKER_14]: and we believe that announcements are
victories, as sincere as they may be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is what has caused some of the
passive things that we just believe it's
[SPEAKER_14]: going to cause.
[SPEAKER_14]: But let me tell you, my last one,
in 1978, Dr. Ken Buckley chaired a
[SPEAKER_14]: committee.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of that, and we just learned that
already, there was a 1975 study done,
[SPEAKER_14]: and Louis Meister found that study.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which showed clinical evidence that
people, a lot of the myths, that gander
[SPEAKER_14]: was universally dangerous.
[SPEAKER_14]: That once you use gander, you are going to
find out how it works.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that has been in the University
Library for many years, and for the
[SPEAKER_14]: people.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just last week that we're coming
out again.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of information about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in 1978, the Jamaican Council of
Churches was opposed to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medical Association of Jamaican
Council was opposed to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that parliamentary committee,
you could appreciate, when it's in 1980,
[SPEAKER_14]: none of the two political parties wanted
to take on the Church, the Medical
[SPEAKER_14]: Association of Jamaica, the United States
of America, all of that, you can't.
[SPEAKER_14]: An inside story.
[SPEAKER_14]: I made a fundamental mistake in 1999.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was in a different room, at a different
time, about to move a resolution for a
[SPEAKER_14]: certain party to legalize, call for the
legalization of gander.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the members of that party were very
interested and very militant, and were
[SPEAKER_14]: going to pass that resolution.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was told, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because study was in progress,
and the Shabbat's Committee was set up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that committee did some good work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fell short, but many of us who were there,
Rasta Silva, Jalang, Paul Chan,
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael Long, fell.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was a good first step.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the legalization was a half-way step.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they go and they gave the slaves
apprenticeship.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the real thing yet, but it still moved
pretty far.
[SPEAKER_14]: So why wouldn't it accept it?
[SPEAKER_14]: And that sat down for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am saying to you, if you understand and
appreciate how important this thing is,
[SPEAKER_14]: it's one of the plants of the National
Economic Recovery Program, and of the
[SPEAKER_14]: local economic development.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thousands of jobs, commerce, distribution,
allow people to grow their own plants for
[SPEAKER_14]: their own use.
[SPEAKER_14]: That we must not wait until the government
is ready.
[SPEAKER_14]: We must agitate, we must advocate,
we must insist.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we can start farming,
and then the family will have the
[SPEAKER_14]: education.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Paul Gerr.
[SPEAKER_06]: And an idea of protecting our intellectual
property rights, because that is certainly
[SPEAKER_06]: important if it's high-grade gander.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next speaker will expand these issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at the economic implications of a
gander industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if in fact, if in fact,
it is as high as 140 billion US dollars,
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even put that into words.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's that, our future is in gander.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we would need to have an economic
framework.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of incentives would we need to
put in place to have fair play?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what sort of incentives would we
need to have to get people involved in the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what kind of regulations would we need
to put in place to have fair play so
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody can come and sit at the table?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what kind of financing mechanisms
would you need?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because from all that we've heard today,
it's good business, but it is expensive
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not easy for you to get into the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Mr. Tony Versuro, who currently runs
the day-to-day operations of the Act Now
[SPEAKER_06]: program, will tell us, will give us some
thoughts as to how we can, or what are the
[SPEAKER_06]: economic implications of the gander
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He runs the day-to-day operations of the
Act Now program, patient care programs,
[SPEAKER_06]: product development, accredited training
protocols, quality assurance, continued
[SPEAKER_06]: education, and oversees all marketing
efforts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Versuro is the founder of River Rock
Wellness, with several medical retail
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis licenses in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the place to be if you love gander.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is where it began.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the good stuff is.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a former general contractor,
he has managed projects in excess of $100
[SPEAKER_06]: million, with an emphasis on
state-to-state operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony will be working hand-in-hand with our
affiliated partners to assure a smooth
[SPEAKER_06]: transition into the United Cannabis
family, and will be coordinating efforts
[SPEAKER_06]: to optimize their mobile operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Versuro has been featured on CNBC
Monitor, Washington Post, and publications
[SPEAKER_06]: in Culture Magazine, TH Magazine,
and High Times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure
to have Mr. Tony Versuro, who has been on
CNBC and other places, to tell us today
about the economic implications of the
gander industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was checking my notes,
and I didn't say anything about the veto
[SPEAKER_09]: or the female plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I had that subject.
[SPEAKER_09]: But mine is a little more cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it comes down to a few things,
and I wrote some notes down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes down to awareness.
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes down to timing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes down to standards, regulations,
brands, and community.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_09]: How aware is your community?
[SPEAKER_09]: How aware are you about medical cannabis,
hemp, social aspects, social
[SPEAKER_09]: responsibility of using cannabis in a
recreational way?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your awareness, which is what's going
to expand the economical impact.
[SPEAKER_09]: How aware are you, and how willing are you
to accept the entire plant and its
[SPEAKER_09]: full-spectrum capability of helping people
and having a place for industry,
[SPEAKER_09]: and also having a place for responsible
recreational use?
[SPEAKER_09]: So the timing is also an important issue,
because the rest of the world is changing
[SPEAKER_09]: around you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So depending on how fast you act at this
particular time, and I mean timing within
[SPEAKER_09]: 90 days to six months.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's very, very, very fast
for everyone in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have to look at what some of the
other professors and principals with you
[SPEAKER_09]: talked about in timing of what's going on
in the United States, what's going on in
[SPEAKER_09]: Guam, what's going on in Canada,
Uruguay, every country around the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at one point, Jamaica had the ball,
and they weren't first.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all knew that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the Roses talked about.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what music talked about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there became Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Prohibition spread in the United States,
and it spread around the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many people went to jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many people sacrificed their lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so today is that opportunity of that
timing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can stand up as an entire nation,
and not fight amongst yourselves,
[SPEAKER_09]: and find those solutions to where you can
help every aspect of life in every
[SPEAKER_09]: department.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that starts with standards.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if everybody wants to be part of these
products, and everybody wants to be part
[SPEAKER_09]: of what's going on, you have to stand
within a community, and you have to build
[SPEAKER_09]: that, like Paul Burke had said before,
I came up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's creating a standard, a standard of
way to grow, a standard of your
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: A standard of your resident, a standard of
processing, and creating local branded
[SPEAKER_09]: products by the people that are here,
through a regulation and a regulatory
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: That also opens up more economical
impacts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you're able to do that, then you can
have localized branded products that are
[SPEAKER_09]: actually made here, like you have your
Blue Mountain coffee, not the raw,
[SPEAKER_09]: not just raw cannabis, but actually
products that are finished and made here,
[SPEAKER_09]: and branded here, and then exported to the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: That has vast, huge community impacts,
not in the billions, but in the trillions.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you accept it, and you're aware
of it, and you understand that there's
[SPEAKER_09]: industrial, medical, and social aspects of
this plant, and you embrace it,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you turn the rest of the world onto
you, and you understand that you have to
[SPEAKER_09]: study it in a scientific aspect,
and debunk all of the different myths,
[SPEAKER_09]: or the different solutions, or the
different things that you've seen,
[SPEAKER_09]: you have to find the most effective way to
use the plant possible for all three of
[SPEAKER_09]: those categories.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to affect your economical
impact.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are pretty big statements.
[SPEAKER_09]: And why do I say that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I say that because I started on the floor
six years ago, like anyone else,
[SPEAKER_09]: with less than $200, six lights,
and six plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I started.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had no economy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had zero.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was a patient, and an activist,
and somebody that had a mission to help
[SPEAKER_09]: myself, and to help the others around me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I also have been through opiates.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been through painkillers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been through car accidents.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been yelled at.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been told I'll never make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been disowned by my family,
all of which did not come true.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kept pushing through.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how I started River Rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in five years, we developed both
indoor and outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: 300 different strains in-house.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've created, actually, I've created
a program.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what she was talking about with
the Act Now program, which is utilizing
[SPEAKER_09]: all full spectrum of all the cannabinoids,
85 additional of them, in its raw and live
[SPEAKER_09]: form, not utilizing activated THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I eliminate THC in the entire program,
but I use the acid forms of THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: This developed into a widespread medicinal
outbreak, if you will, in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what ended up happening was we didn't
help 3% of the nation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started helping 80% of our population,
with effectiveness of 90%.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the list of autoimmune and central
nervous dysfunctions we were able to
[SPEAKER_09]: address without any psychoactive
experience whatsoever, utilizing the full
[SPEAKER_09]: plant in its full integrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I need a round of applause for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in that process, I also went public.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I took all of these products and all
these inventions and these things and
[SPEAKER_09]: these ideas, and decided to implement them
in state by state, since we weren't
[SPEAKER_09]: allowed to cross borders.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we still have prohibition going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in doing so, this allowed us to
infiltrate into different territories to
[SPEAKER_09]: set up this information and use partners
and localized, gross and sustainable
[SPEAKER_09]: community projects that allow us to grow
within.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a massive economical impact.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this all comes from how much do you
want to accept this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you just want hemp?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you just want medical ganja?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to accept the social and
recreational aspect?
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, having all three of those,
and taking your time with that,
[SPEAKER_09]: and understanding how to actually create
those regulations and standards,
[SPEAKER_09]: and following the lead of everyone that's
up here, that saying those things is the
[SPEAKER_09]: most appropriate way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to think of this as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: With training, farming, education,
testing, careers, banking, it's humongous.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not in the billions.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what's going to save multiple nations
and multiple places.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what makes Jamaica unique?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just the vibe.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the high rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the people that want to make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually want to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Today, I spoke to children about wanting
to get involved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get to speak to children about
cannabis in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this starts early, and it starts with
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Tony, for your very
inspirational talk on the value of ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Paul said that nearly several years
ago that the Jamaican Council of Churches
[SPEAKER_06]: opposed the whole business of ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't say, lick them, Jar Jar Jar
Jar, lick them, Lord.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have said that for night church
groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Bible says that herbs are for the
healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wondered, then, what would Dr. Gary
Harriot, who is the secretary of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaican Council of Churches, say on the
matter of ganja?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the biblical and moral issues?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Tony gave us a clue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony said we must have social
responsibility when it's our children.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Winston Delahay says if my young son,
who is 10, smokes it, it will affect his
[SPEAKER_06]: memory and his learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he says.
[SPEAKER_06]: His research is showing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is his research right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he says yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have done real studies, and that's what
he's showing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dr. Gary Harriot will tell us what
are the biblical and moral issues related
[SPEAKER_06]: to ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is a minister of religion, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was ordained in 1991, and he has served
the United States Church in Jamaica and
[SPEAKER_06]: the Cayman Islands in a variety of
capacities, both in Jamaica and the Grand
[SPEAKER_06]: Cayman.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since September 2006, Reverend Harriot has
been serving as general secretary for the
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaican Council of Churches, an
ecumenical body of 11 Christian
[SPEAKER_06]: denominations.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't include the independent
churches, but nonetheless, it carries the
[SPEAKER_06]: Catholics, the Baptists, the Methodists,
and the Catholics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reverend Harriot, you're a family
counselor and a family counselor and a
[SPEAKER_06]: broadcaster.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should tell my child that they should
really have it, or whether my nephew
[SPEAKER_06]: should be smoking ganja at 20 as he goes
to university, or whether this country
[SPEAKER_06]: should embark on a process of change,
where real poverty could be solved if we
[SPEAKER_06]: could harness the resources from ganja and
make several products and make real income
[SPEAKER_06]: at last.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Join us at the podium to tell us about the
biblical and moral issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good to be here and to be
participating in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not going to present an official
position of JCC, and I will say that it is
[SPEAKER_03]: not likely that what I will say will
represent the view of the church in
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have, in preparation for coming and
sharing with you, I did reflect with some
[SPEAKER_03]: of my colleagues in JCC to hear their
thoughts on this matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if those responses that I've gotten,
well, they seem to be indicating,
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul, that some conversion is taking
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I suppose the church,
like many others, lack of full information
[SPEAKER_03]: and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you do not know something,
it creates, it has a way of creating
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety and fear and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that the church is perfect,
and therefore you will find that happening
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I shared some thoughts with all my
colleagues or got some of their input as I
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared to share with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to begin by where we call
creation theology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is based on our understanding of
the creation narrative, where in Genesis,
[SPEAKER_03]: God created the heavens and the earth,
and he said, it is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the psalmist in chapter 24 captures it
very well when he says, the earth is a
[SPEAKER_03]: Lawrence, and everything that is in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a faith perspective, we believe
that the universe is created by God,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that God has entrusted the stewardship
of its resources to humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since humanity, or human beings,
are God's stewards, we are accountable to
[SPEAKER_03]: God for what we do with God's creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, we should not abuse God's
creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must use it in ways that enable life,
in ways that empower human beings,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the rest of the creative order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana, then, is one of the resources,
and our scientists and their knowledge and
[SPEAKER_03]: skills are among the gifts that God has
given to creation and to us human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they too, like the rest of us,
must endeavor to be good stewards of the
[SPEAKER_03]: resources that God has given to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is appropriate to give thanks to God
for our scientists, the discoveries that
[SPEAKER_03]: are being made, and that all of us
together must work at protecting health,
[SPEAKER_03]: well-being, and the economic empowerment
of our people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love and neighborliness are important
principles of the Christian faith.
[SPEAKER_03]: As such, we must be concerned about those
who are anxious about what
[SPEAKER_03]: decriminalization, legalization may mean,
the negative impact it could have on
[SPEAKER_03]: families, society in general, and
especially people who are able to speak
[SPEAKER_03]: from their own experience of how it has
affected them, or how it has affected
[SPEAKER_03]: their families.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we must do all that we can to protect
the vulnerable while making good of the
[SPEAKER_03]: resources that God has given to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, for us, that is a moral issue,
that you must protect the vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Leahy has raised some of the
concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justice, and I hear Paul speaking to some
of this, but justice is another important
[SPEAKER_03]: principle for us as Christians.
[SPEAKER_03]: We consider it unjust, where the negative
side of the story is what is highlighted,
[SPEAKER_03]: and has prevented the scientific
exploration over these many years to
[SPEAKER_03]: advance in the ways that it could have
advanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see is that our greatest
critics, if we are not careful,
[SPEAKER_03]: will deprive us from the benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we allow that to happen,
if we allow others to manipulate the
[SPEAKER_03]: possibilities, unlike other things where
we export and then have to turn around and
[SPEAKER_03]: import, that will be irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another justice question surrounds,
and again I hear Paul raising,
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that over the years, it is mostly
our poor black males who have been dragged
[SPEAKER_03]: before the courts for the use of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if we are going the route of embracing
a more liberalized approach, we should
[SPEAKER_03]: ensure that the wealth in our land are not
the only ones to experience the
[SPEAKER_03]: significant benefits from the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should ensure that it is so structured
that the ordinary, organized, Dominican
[SPEAKER_03]: people can also benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an issue of greed that we need to
watch, and that's a moral issue as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: that sometimes there's a tendency to want
to get the most out of it and put the
[SPEAKER_03]: least in it, and so we need to ensure that
greed does not allow us to sacrifice
[SPEAKER_03]: standard and quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we need to ensure that all the
necessary inputs are made so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: maintain proper standards of the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our final presenter is Mr. Courtney Betty,
who will tell us about the medicinal
[SPEAKER_06]: tourism implications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Courtney Betty is a lawyer, but he's a
lawyer with a conscience.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a lawyer that has a social
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has gained an excellent understanding
of the legal and regulatory framework at
[SPEAKER_06]: the Department of Justice in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has also had a successful track record
of contributing to the development of
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaica, having served as a former senior
legal counsel of the Fair Trade
[SPEAKER_06]: Commission, and he had to pave the way to
have the deregulation of
[SPEAKER_06]: telecommunications in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Betty has played a key role in
advancing the development of medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana industry in Jamaica,
and he's modeled the Green-Gold Triangle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell us what that means?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Green-Gold Triangle maximizes the
opportunities for Jamaica by creating
[SPEAKER_06]: partnerships which ensures participation
from both sectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: His vision for Jamaica is to utilize our
natural, herbal resources to create health
[SPEAKER_06]: and wealth for our nation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, let us invite Mr.
Courtney Betty to tell us about the
medicinal tourism implications.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_12]: As I heard Paul speak, and I was just
reminding him, how long ago we actually
[SPEAKER_12]: started this ballot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not as long as Paul Chang.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to recognize Paul.
[SPEAKER_12]: Please stand up, Paul Chang.
[SPEAKER_12]: For the work that Paul has done really on
the whole issue of social justice.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that work has been going on for many
years, whether you talk about Peter Tosh
[SPEAKER_12]: or many of the others that have really
been at the forefront.
[SPEAKER_12]: As a lawyer sitting and looking at the
opportunities here in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_12]: it was very interesting because as a
lawyer you start off first with your legal
[SPEAKER_12]: mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I discovered was that in 1974,
the laws of Jamaica actually have a
[SPEAKER_12]: provision that excluded medical marijuana
from the definition of ganja.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a really interesting situation
because we're actually one of the first
[SPEAKER_12]: countries that I'm aware of in the world
that actually has a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_12]: provision from back in 1974.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was a result of that that young
individuals such as Dr. Lockhart that
[SPEAKER_12]: presented this morning and Dr. West that
were able to develop amazing products,
[SPEAKER_12]: camisole and nasmosole.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was quite a surprise as we're now
going through many years later trying to
[SPEAKER_12]: put in place a legal and regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been fortunate in working along with
Hawthorne from the initial process,
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at the type of submissions that
would go to cabinet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Worked along with the Minister of Justice
who in his presentation of the first
[SPEAKER_12]: document that was tabled recognized the
work that time has sit down and trying to
[SPEAKER_12]: look at the potential legal and regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I saw was a couple of things when
I started on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw Israel starting after Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: But they had moved this so far advanced.
[SPEAKER_12]: They put in place a legal and regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_12]: They began all the scientific and research
development that was required.
[SPEAKER_12]: They owned the vast majority of patents.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go and you search marijuana patent,
you're going to be shocked how many
[SPEAKER_12]: Israeli companies actually own those
patents.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're very far ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my vision, which we launched here in
Jamaica on May 22nd, was to really combine
[SPEAKER_12]: the research, the technology that has been
developed, the common practices from
[SPEAKER_12]: Israel with the greatness of Jamaica or
natural goods and products that we're able
[SPEAKER_12]: to grow here and bring it to the
international market.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we called it the Green Gold Triangle.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as I look today, we didn't
trademark that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm glad to see that we're here at the
Green Gold Conference.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we move farther because we had a
particular vision.
[SPEAKER_12]: Having worked here in Jamaica and worked
on the community level on many different
[SPEAKER_12]: projects, I don't need to mention them
specifically.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we wanted to do was to create,
first and foremost, a common
[SPEAKER_12]: infrastructure that all industries and all
people in Jamaica could actually tap into.
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of the things that Tony mentioned,
for example, testing facilities,
[SPEAKER_12]: and Arthur had mentioned as well,
being able to distinguish the amount of
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD versus THB, all of those
infrastructures actually now in place at
[SPEAKER_12]: the University of the West Indies through
a partnership that Timeless has put
[SPEAKER_12]: together to form a herbal medicine
research center at the University of the
[SPEAKER_12]: West Indies.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next partnership that we went and we
look forward, because we really thought it
[SPEAKER_12]: was important to ground ourselves in some
history, was the Maroons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Colonel Lumsden is here with us today,
now looking at setting up Colonel Lumsden.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you stand up, please?
[SPEAKER_12]: As best I can.
[SPEAKER_12]: As best as we can.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Colonel Lumsden came to us with a
project aimed at tourism for the Maroons
[SPEAKER_12]: community in Portland.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we've been assisting and working
with them in terms of getting that rural
[SPEAKER_12]: ecosystem tourism project going.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next initiative that we look at,
and we'll talk about it, was tourism
[SPEAKER_12]: outside of Antigua Bay.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with Dr. William Courtney and his
wife, Christine, and others, we're looking
[SPEAKER_12]: at a medical utopia where people can come
in from all across the world, particular
[SPEAKER_12]: senior citizens, and be able to get the
type of treatment that they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_12]: get in the North American environment,
the type of medicines, the type of herbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at Dr. Janice Fisher,
one of the leading experts on medical
[SPEAKER_12]: tourism and stem cell research,
and the work that she's been doing in
[SPEAKER_12]: Antigua Bay, we're now looking to enhance
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the opportunities from a tourism
standpoint, again, it's a challenging
[SPEAKER_12]: situation because we're trying to separate
recreational and all these other elements.
[SPEAKER_12]: The medical tourism side internationally
is the one that has tremendous potential.
[SPEAKER_12]: And people will come to the shores of
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: People are not coming to the shores of
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: As Dr. Lockhart may have said,
people are coming here and importing
[SPEAKER_12]: canisole into 23 countries.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are things that we are already
doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The goal is not to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_12]: The goal is to see how we can build,
put the proper infrastructure in place to
[SPEAKER_12]: be able to move this ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your excellent
presentation on the medicinal tourism
[SPEAKER_06]: implications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Akampong is such an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, all of those areas, because you have
such a rich history, a rich heritage,
[SPEAKER_06]: rich knowledge that now can be used in a
very sensible kind of way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard from
the panelists they've given us some idea
[SPEAKER_06]: of the medicinal and health implications,
the scientific implications, farming,
[SPEAKER_06]: economic, biblical and moral implications,
and finally, the medicinal tourism
[SPEAKER_06]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: What have we heard?
[SPEAKER_06]: That 203 million users use ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: 203 million persons use ganja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, I see that it's 140 billion
dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the business for the Andromeda's
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Tony, her sura says, no, you're
looking at what is today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not looking at the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not looking at the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look at the future,
you're talking trillions.
[SPEAKER_06]: When he said trillions, my eyes saw all
the signs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought about the health of the
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got so excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: About the money and the health
implications on all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people like Dr. Harriet and Courtney
Betty says, we need regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have an even more careful
playing field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make certain that we can have
what we want and minimize the negative
[SPEAKER_06]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Dr. Winston Delaney was not afraid
to say, there are possibilities,
[SPEAKER_06]: but let me caution you about some of the
negative impacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't wanna hear about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think I'm a do-sale.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm gonna tell you anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he told us what are the
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you call cannabis-induced psychosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see things, you pretend, you think
you're hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're out of all the experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, you don't wanna have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're a kid, you don't wanna take
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, the past is set.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have facts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us see how we can eradicate poverty,
develop viable businesses, and move on
[SPEAKER_06]: while minimizing the negative impacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, again, the possibility of
medicinal tourism in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure you have a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna open the floor now for you to
ask the panelists and to share your ideas
[SPEAKER_06]: on the possibilities of sentimental,
ganja, cannabis, hemp, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever you call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really Jamaica's green gold?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the floor is open.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see someone waving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Valety, prevent me from putting on my
glasses so I can see you in the black.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing, testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Tony Vesper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm just gonna call him Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: He mentioned something about time in this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to find out if anyone can
shine some light on where we are in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of regulation, getting all of these things
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six weeks to six months, he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we meet that kind of timing,
do you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get some assistance here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the mic on?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go to the podium, Tony?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with that problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't speak to your regulations because
I don't like to take political or
[SPEAKER_09]: government involved in any type of
political stuff or regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just lay out my opinion and what I think
people should do and how it could impact
[SPEAKER_09]: people on all levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will be on USA Today and then later
on on Vice that's on TV talking about what
[SPEAKER_09]: will happen when the United States
reschedules cannabis to a two,
[SPEAKER_09]: three, four, or even five.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they will reschedule it eventually.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's elections that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: What ends up happening is when the United
States makes that move and it's no longer
[SPEAKER_09]: a class one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So THC would not be up there with heroin,
would not be up there with cocaine or acid
[SPEAKER_09]: as everyone in this room knows it
shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even smoking a spliff should be up
even anywhere near that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when they change that, that has drastic
implications on what can happen in the
[SPEAKER_09]: United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently clinical trials are very,
very difficult to start.
[SPEAKER_09]: Universities, professors, and science
communities don't integrate as they do
[SPEAKER_09]: here and no one's all for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, even someone in my position
can't actually take the products that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're using to help for cancer and
epilepsy and seizures, chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_09]: opioid dependency, things like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't just go test them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't just go to the local university
and ask them to get involved and help us
[SPEAKER_09]: with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the moment they change that is when the
opportunity changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't act, as a country upon
that, in the next, I said 90 days to six
[SPEAKER_09]: months, then that window starts to shrink.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you have six months and then
that window starts to go away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would I still think that the economy would
still boost even if you made the changes?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, because people want to come to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to come to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, it's 17 degrees.
That's where I live.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could take part in medicinal herbs
and all kinds of plant-based medicine and
[SPEAKER_09]: integrate this with cannabinoids,
I would be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people want to come here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even patients want to come here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is paradise.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to open up tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want to act upon it in a very
smart, intelligent way as soon as
[SPEAKER_09]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to add to what Tony just said in
relation to the big question that you
[SPEAKER_04]: raised, unfortunately, you missed the
earlier session of the presentations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had somebody who made a
presentation regarding the status of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Dangerous Drugs Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were told that hopefully by
December of this year, it should be in
[SPEAKER_04]: Parliament and we're moving on track to
get it sorted out as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, next person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, over here.
Good night.
Good night, everybody.
Just before you answer, may I invite
persons who want to ask questions to do
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly what you need to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come into the aisle and use the mic in the
aisle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to ask the creators of this
conference.
[SPEAKER_11]: The theme of the conference is medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to know what level of
consultation there has been with the
[SPEAKER_11]: medical fraternity considering that
nutraceuticals are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_11]: traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's somewhat carousal is not a
nutraceutical.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is a sphere for use of
cannabinoids in terms of as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the level of consultation in terms
of this kind of conference with the
[SPEAKER_11]: medical fraternity or the ministry of
health or whoever there is that controls
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine in this country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anybody who wants to take a
question?
[SPEAKER_00]: There really has not been any level of
consultation with the medical fraternity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A conference such as this is really
designed to get ideas rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting a particular group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You swoon to get ideas like yours and
everybody's that is put into the melting
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and recommendations are put forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conference is really designed to
get information and to give information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Delahaney, do you want to say
anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, good evening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have been noticing with all that is
going on that the manufacturing part of it
[SPEAKER_16]: is unregistered.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have been asked many questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: How are we going to get the government to
work faster to make production legal?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the manufacturers are,
they're separate, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Medicine and ganja is already on the team.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we need the farmers because you need
the produce.
[SPEAKER_16]: You need the product to work for and to
work with, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: You need the ganja to do your extracts.
[SPEAKER_16]: You need the ganja to do whatever you need
to make your products.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our problem is if there is no farmer,
then you're going to have a problem
[SPEAKER_16]: getting your stuff in raw material,
right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I am suggesting is all the
producers of the various products come
[SPEAKER_16]: together with us as the farmers and press
the case along with us.
Make the government know that if you don't
legalize the farming, no, we won't be able
[SPEAKER_16]: to produce anything to export from
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if that doesn't happen, we are still
going to be here talking down,
[SPEAKER_16]: right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is the suggestion to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure all the farmers are in
agreement with this, that all these people
[SPEAKER_16]: who are producing the products should come
into the game with us or put some petition
[SPEAKER_16]: to the government saying, if we,
you don't legalize the farmers,
[SPEAKER_16]: no, then we're going to shut down because
we won't be getting any raw material to
[SPEAKER_16]: make our products.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my opinion.
It's a really interesting comment,
I must say, but I think the government
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of is interested in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The days of resistance are over,
as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask you, young man,
if you'd be kind enough to have Brennan
[SPEAKER_06]: speak before you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you're in a blue jacket, a black
jacket.
[SPEAKER_15]: I ask, I request that I stand until I
speak because I have, beyond what the
[SPEAKER_15]: country needs, and sometimes you have to
think about yourself, because I too have a
[SPEAKER_15]: personal problem, situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what I want to speak about is about
tourism, medicinal tourism or tourism that
[SPEAKER_15]: could generate from medical marijuana,
marijuana, period.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a tournament, a wrestling
tournament with the formal communities in
[SPEAKER_15]: Charleston on the 6th of December.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now we have a magazine out of America that
said that they would fund it this
[SPEAKER_15]: tournament and would guarantee a certain
number of people coming to the tournament
[SPEAKER_15]: the size that would make Portland as a
tourism destination get a significant
[SPEAKER_15]: boost.
[SPEAKER_15]: However, one of the things that they are
requesting is that there be something that
[SPEAKER_15]: says that when these people come to
Jamaica, within the boundaries of
[SPEAKER_15]: Charleston, which is clearly demand,
that they would not be harassed the 6th of
December.
A compound gets the same thing on the 6th
of January.
[SPEAKER_15]: Six might be something, the ancestors
want, but the 6th of December.
[SPEAKER_15]: The government can't give us that money to
put on that tournament.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are suggesting that we are trying
to find our own, and we're wondering if
[SPEAKER_15]: the government would help us in some way,
shape or form to satisfy these people
[SPEAKER_15]: that, indeed, we could get away with.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for that one day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for that one day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get a waiver of what?
[SPEAKER_15]: A waiver that we will not let the people
that come to Charleston for the
[SPEAKER_15]: tournament, the wrestling tournament,
get smoked within the defined boundaries
[SPEAKER_15]: of Charleston.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not so sure if there's anyone at the
table who can speak to this, but are there
[SPEAKER_06]: any takers?
[SPEAKER_06]: We will note your request for an end,
but I'm not so sure if anybody can give a
[SPEAKER_06]: comment at this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Suggestion?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go larger.
[SPEAKER_17]: Next person.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening to the panel.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to preface what I'm about to say,
first by saying that I only heard about
[SPEAKER_17]: this gathering, the conference on the
Radio Nation, like I have absolutely no
[SPEAKER_17]: interest, no business interest in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I am completely and totally against
recreational use of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_17]: having seen what it has done to a few
persons.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to start there.
[SPEAKER_17]: Having said that, though, in Jamaica,
we are blocking the road, and our road is
[SPEAKER_17]: not getting looked after by the MP.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is a good cause to block the
road, because if half of what you all said
[SPEAKER_17]: is really so, with the type of money that
is waiting for Jamaica to exploit,
[SPEAKER_17]: then this is a really good cause to block
hope road tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to preface the rest of what I'm
about to say first by saying I'm also a
[SPEAKER_17]: Christian.
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of the day, the Lord gave us,
as the reverend said, all these things for
[SPEAKER_17]: our own better.
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said, I am completely and totally
against the recreational use of this drug,
[SPEAKER_17]: having two young daughters myself.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, question.
[SPEAKER_17]: When has Jamaica ever taken and held with
both hands an opportunity like this,
[SPEAKER_17]: when the people did not intervene and get
radical about demanding that the
[SPEAKER_17]: government does it?
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we go by our history, us sitting
down, discussing it, as you all said
[SPEAKER_17]: earlier, where these things have been done
from 10, 15, 20 years ago, will change
[SPEAKER_17]: very little.
[SPEAKER_17]: I listen carefully to my brother from up
north, who said that the window closes or
[SPEAKER_17]: starts to shrink in about six months.
[SPEAKER_17]: That means we have to act now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Burke, I think you are uniquely placed
and positioned, considering the governing
[SPEAKER_17]: administration.
[SPEAKER_17]: So hang on to a few persons and say,
hear me, hear me.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the chance and the window is
closing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would really look, and I'm sorry for
preaching so long, I would really look at
[SPEAKER_17]: the end of all that is said at a very
clear course.
[SPEAKER_17]: The course is charted as to tomorrow
morning, what is it a person like me who's
[SPEAKER_17]: just interested in Jamaica's betterment?
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it is not a business interest for
me.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only about how can Jamaica benefit in
the long run.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would want to hear over the river
tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_17]: If I'm a short down half retreat to help
block the road, I'm willing to call.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so say all of us, but I should tell
you brother, I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just in it for the health reason in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm into it, but not my neck.
My neck.
Thank you.
Good, next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is for Paul.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I heard you right when you
spoke about the size of the farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying that we should limit the
production in terms of the size of the
[SPEAKER_05]: farms?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are allowing people to have production
just of a certain size?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like you to explain that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been very consistent that in the
first years of the industry that you have
[SPEAKER_14]: to know the small farmers, they place on
the plain field so they are not doubled
[SPEAKER_14]: up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if the product is to make
manufactured products ought to go abroad,
[SPEAKER_14]: then scales of economy will dictate that
those that own 200 acres, 50 acres,
[SPEAKER_14]: 100 acres, 500 acres would be the persons
engaged in the contract.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you force a situation where only small
farmers can grow in the first three years,
[SPEAKER_14]: it means that who wants to come in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_14]: Has to engage the small farm and not the
big farm.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that the big farm or the small farm on
the same platform can only grow one acre,
[SPEAKER_14]: five acres, whatever the amount is for the
first three years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we can review and decide what is.
[SPEAKER_14]: If we ever make the mistake of allowing
those who have money to buy a license,
[SPEAKER_14]: pay by acreage, you are going to find that
this industry is going to end up for the
[SPEAKER_14]: big farmer and the traditional farmer is
going to be left outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: What that is going to tell us is that we
are going to lose some economic advantage.
[SPEAKER_14]: So be it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Economic advantage for who?
[SPEAKER_14]: The big farmer who has never been bought.
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe, honestly, that unless you
protect the small farmer at the outset,
[SPEAKER_14]: he or she is going to be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in farming for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very poor person coming from grassroots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do not think we should limit the
productivity in any area in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to me carefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was president of the Jamaica Bee Farmers
Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bee for the bee.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lady came in from New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, let me see the kind of honey
that you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we say, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know how to make up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Labo honey is the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we gave her a sample to take.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what she said to us?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many trailer loads can you supply?
[SPEAKER_05]: After she tested it, we have not replied
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see, three years, there's a number
of powers we are talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot limit productivity for three
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a country of samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to get out of the idea of saying
we are going to produce this into the
[SPEAKER_05]: home.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to expand and begin from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: If a big person has a thousand acres,
what we have to do is to make sure he pays
[SPEAKER_05]: tasks like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the benefit of the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small farmers have to be protected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I am one too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to protect the first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regulation to protect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of production, if we are
going to limit it to this small amount,
[SPEAKER_05]: what if the market outside wants to take
the rest of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to produce for the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the market wants it, here we are in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe in cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to protect the small farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of productivity, we have to
make sure that we maximize our efforts.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the simple way is to allow
everybody at the same time to increase the
[SPEAKER_14]: acreage they can grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is all.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you decide, it goes from five to
ten, to fifteen, it's for everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So as the production goes, you study the
market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you say, well everybody now instead of
having one acre, two acres, three acres,
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever it is, you can now go up to five,
you can now go up to ten.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it can't be that a big man,
because he owns the land.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not fighting against anybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: The big farmer can grow fifty acres,
one hundred acres when the small farmer
[SPEAKER_14]: doesn't have that capacity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Allow everybody to grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Allow them to get land from the government
that is idle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Small farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And encourage and empower that group to
grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can continue debating it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure we can find a middle road
solution.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is much cynicism.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've heard that the small farmer is
going to be sold out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me tell you, it is going to be a
major backlash.
[SPEAKER_14]: If people in the communities and across
Jamaica feel that now that industry is
[SPEAKER_14]: open, that is not open and fair term.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to add to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talked about, he said that we
might be limited economically.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually don't think so.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that you can do this with a happy
medium.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they did this in Colorado too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people that are in the industry in
Colorado actually had to live there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to be residents.
[SPEAKER_09]: For many years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't be an owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't work in the industry without a
residency.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this situation, when who writes
regulations, it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you say that you can only hire local
farmers that are certified and registered
[SPEAKER_09]: through whatever local program you would
have.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, anyone that has whatever
size land has to use local farmers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, everyone that works in
farming has a job.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if somebody has a market demand for
something that demands more than five
[SPEAKER_09]: acres, well, you have to expand that
within the community.
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of what our program was about was
utilizing five, 10, and 15 acreage into
[SPEAKER_09]: smaller farmers and giving them guidance,
giving them things for free and supplying
[SPEAKER_09]: them with the tools, the genetics,
and the information on how to do it
[SPEAKER_09]: better.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_09]: That increases the value of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: That increases with the demand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that increases with the actual income
which that local farmer will make,
[SPEAKER_09]: which will then turn around and spend that
back on the community.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to all, however the system
works, come together and figure out how to
[SPEAKER_09]: keep the community locked and involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other companies that will come here,
and what he's talking about is companies
[SPEAKER_09]: bigger than what I would be considered.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really consider myself very big.
[SPEAKER_09]: But somebody like Pfizer or somebody that
would come in here, they would bring their
[SPEAKER_09]: own system, their own labor, and that
could happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could get extorting out of a lot
of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you have to figure out mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very simple with the labor and with the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll take the next person.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ganja evening.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some ganja juice, raw ganja juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have SS molasses.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually on the market, helping people
anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, still, what I want to know,
me here not talk about farmers and protect
[SPEAKER_08]: the farmers, big farmers and this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to ask.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have limited amount and I have a thing
where I say people can plant five trees or
[SPEAKER_08]: two trees or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we do that thing, you know,
through some time, them say, the citizens
[SPEAKER_08]: have limited amount of trees where them
can plant one, two, or three trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have something like that they want?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the citizens can plant any amount of
the tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the citizens.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: What Mr. Burke was saying, what Paul Burke
was saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they don't get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just want to get it before.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, instead of telling Mr. Burke's
story, and then Paul Burke say what he
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_14]: There are two situations.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are people who want to go into it
for easy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And therefore, there must be some
regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_14]: How they enter the business.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I believe also that each and every
individual who wants to grow for their own
[SPEAKER_14]: personal use, not for commercial purposes,
should be allowed to grow a certain number
[SPEAKER_14]: of plants for his or her own personal use.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see why somebody who wants to use
it must be forced to go and buy it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: So more on what is that limited amount?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard rumors talking about five trees.
[SPEAKER_14]: About you, even for a start, to allow
people without any license, without any
[SPEAKER_14]: regulation, in the confines of their home
boundaries, to be able to grow at least
[SPEAKER_14]: five trees.
[SPEAKER_14]: Five trees.
[SPEAKER_13]: The bigger part, I don't believe.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I talk about those who want to grow
commercially.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want to grow commercially for
business, that's a different situation.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am talking about unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_13]: That people should not have to go and get
a license to grow for their own person.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't want to debate.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we don't want to debate.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want the principle established.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the principle I have pushed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get it clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you hear me say, all right,
we're going to stay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The five tree business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a raw foodist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I go extreme raw.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how the mana player flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, I make the juice called raw
herbal cell anti-aging, anti-cancer ganja
[SPEAKER_08]: juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been working on the ground through
tourism.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have people coming from the state who
pay $3,000 to get that 21-day anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_08]: activation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now in Jamaica, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I take it to the street right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, what I'm going to tell you now,
and if you don't go like this,
[SPEAKER_08]: it ain't going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many calcansers, this is what I'm saying,
can't have five trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why many calcansers can't have
trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not busy with the farmer, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I look out for it, I'm busy with the
citizens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Each citizen of Jamaica needs at least
three pounds of food.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have ganja fresh each day to make ganja
salad, what we make.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm featuring at least two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't say, I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Jamaica, the ganja I have, what I'm
going to be selling, it ain't going to
[SPEAKER_08]: difference if I'm going to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to have cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm telling you, with this juice
right here, we don't need nothing more,
[SPEAKER_08]: and if we have three pound of ganja each
day, three pound of fresh ganja will lick
[SPEAKER_08]: away any cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I don't want to be
prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, number two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, I get your ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's law.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, tell it as a professional.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, pound of ganja for each citizen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: I get from all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the reason why.
[SPEAKER_08]: A pound of ganja, when you dice it up,
if you don't chew it, to make a salad.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you cut up, you're going to make a
ganja salad.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a pound of ganja.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to trade it before chopping
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you do that, this is the foundation
you're going to have to establish.
[SPEAKER_08]: For below three pounds of ganja for each
citizen, it ain't going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I take it from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I take it from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, next speaker, please.
Next speaker, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next speaker, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that culturally, I like the
root principle.
[SPEAKER_07]: People we ought to know at land is the
people who built Atlantis in Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_07]: They came to Jamaica first.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really have a serious problem with
putting off an almost anti-business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have a culture of, I know it's
nice to, you know, soak up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But everything we seem to do is always
just seem to put off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that somebody suggested,
maybe that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is that, I would really like
us as a culture to get to the stage where
[SPEAKER_07]: we demand of our leaders, we demand
performance and talk, talk, talk,
[SPEAKER_07]: talk, talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel that wherever the opportunities
come up the avenues, we need to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need as a culture maybe doing things on
time and just say to them, we have spoken
[SPEAKER_07]: enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: We throw away too many opportunities,
and I see it every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you that there is a fierce
urgency of knowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I must suggest that two things.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, 10 years ago, you would have a
scientific research council having a
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting like this where all ideas can
contain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second thing is that remember that
Minister Powell well is the patron of the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis task force.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems to me we're in good hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the Minister of Science, Technology,
Energy, and Management.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making progress, but we have to get
it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're moving, in my view, as fast as
we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see where Courtney and Betty wants to
say something.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to be defending government,
but the work that's been done by Minister
[SPEAKER_12]: Golding, in coming forward and starting,
it's been slow.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has been slow.
[SPEAKER_12]: But here's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't get it right, then all of this
is lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't mean that they haven't been slow.
[SPEAKER_12]: The other part of it is Jamaica,
Jamaica, from a legal standpoint,
[SPEAKER_12]: is different from many other places in the
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because whether we like to admit it or
not, ganja is de facto legal in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: According to the United States government,
there's 35,000 hectares of ganja that's
[SPEAKER_12]: being grown in Jamaica right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how do you try and impose a legal
system on something that's engraved in the
[SPEAKER_12]: society?
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are some cultural and sensitive
errors.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not justifying it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying that they're not things
that they could have done, but it's not as
[SPEAKER_12]: simple as many of us would like to think
from a strictly legal standpoint.
[SPEAKER_12]: From the political standpoint,
I'll leave that to others.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Courtney and I are friends, colleagues,
but I have to disagree fundamentally about
[SPEAKER_14]: getting it right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get interim legislation in place,
and you can review it in two, three years'
[SPEAKER_14]: time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can allow the growing right now of
research and development.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do a number of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: This thing can be done if there is a
political will.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't need less than a month.
[SPEAKER_14]: The gun court was put up in seven days.
[SPEAKER_14]: This thing can be done in less than a
month.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to wait to cross every T
and dot every I, and you're going to wait
[SPEAKER_14]: another year or two to get that
legislation up.
[SPEAKER_14]: What you need to do is to put something
interim and have the consultation with the
[SPEAKER_14]: stakeholders, and you upgrade the law,
and you add in whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I am totally opposed to this concept
of getting it right, because if by the
[SPEAKER_14]: time we get it right, we will rock out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The difficult, easy part is you can make
regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not withstanding such and so and so,
we are allowing so and so, the minister,
[SPEAKER_07]: to give permission.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say one thing too on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to add to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had some experience with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: The United States moves really slow as
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: The way they're getting it done is they're
issuing little pieces of paper that are
[SPEAKER_09]: provisional licenses, and they take years
to dot all the I's and cross all the T's.
[SPEAKER_09]: It took them five years to give me,
not seven licenses, I have 19 licenses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Five years from the time they started on
the floor with three lights, they gave me
[SPEAKER_09]: a little piece of paper that said go.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the fifth year, they finally caught up
to me and they said, well, how much
[SPEAKER_09]: business did you do?
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, well, how much business did you
do?
I said, well, how much business did you
do?
