[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, welcome to Bulb Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in his hash cave.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where he makes his sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably makes his water hash out here as
well, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there, behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we got a substantial bag of trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bag, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A substantial bag, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice sugar leaf there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, all sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got your 4 by 2 foot screens
set up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your 200 lines per inch and your 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble now, right beside that,
in case you got a tumble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your bubble box.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're all covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the whole little sort of hash
area here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got my little bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like to do the water extraction as
well, but once I've, since I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: turned off in the dry sift, I honestly
haven't used my bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel kind of bad about it even.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, John did it for the longest
time until I went over there and got his
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble bags going with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's like, he's probably made
three batches without me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you guys were doing the fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when you can get the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I haven't tried yet and I
definitely want to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's next on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you take them through how you go
about doing a batch and sort of,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, give them a brief
description of the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll take them through the
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: While you're doing that, I'm going to hit
that mothership.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, right here, I like to
take my leaf, take it out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I put my gloves on so I don't
get it because I use a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw it all over my hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it all over here, like only a little
bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice and small handful, I just drop it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give it a little thing, scoop it up,
put it in a Tupperware tub.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do that for the whole process of the
bag on the top screen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't grind it up into smaller things
and then let it run through and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just take the leaf and just nice good,
do-handed handful, rough it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then once that's done, we go to the bottom
screen, switch it around and we start
[SPEAKER_04]: sifting and start purifying the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is substantially good, better than
anything I've smoked is the dry sift and
[SPEAKER_04]: the full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you get turned on to it,
and unfortunately, you can't even seem to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke the joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't appreciate a good, proper joint
even after you are turned on to this and
[SPEAKER_04]: spoiled by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you want to do a light... Sure do.
[SPEAKER_03]: ...start off and do a light sifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can... I will... Just tell me where
you want me and... I'm right over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get some gloves on before I
start messing around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got your dry sift gloves on.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little resin on there already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, these have been used always
between the fingers and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when I'm just watching people make
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I like to bake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll use a... A pan underneath or
something?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a cup for work now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have that ready, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to do a light bounce
on the 100 lines per inch screen,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 150 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the resin fall down onto the 70
micron, which is 200 lines per inch in
[SPEAKER_03]: mesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we will do the carding.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of the magic screen that a lot
of people didn't know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the 70 micron screen is what
used to be the bottom catch plate on a
[SPEAKER_03]: sift box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can prepare the next one of those for
you too, if you want.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should get that one on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty.
Now, put that right there.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just take a handful off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bounce it off of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Move around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and gentle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll scoop it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw it into the next bin, which we'll be
going into the tumble now.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a secondary bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really your first initial going
for your quality, being as gentle as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best quality, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a sort of multitude of
ways to go about dry sifting, but whether
[SPEAKER_03]: you're wet washing or dry sifting,
you always want to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't make any mistakes that affect the
quality of your first batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heads that are willing to fall through
the screens initially are always the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest, the most bulbous, the most
mature, the ones that we all want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can do this process properly,
it's going to definitely make you a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: happier with how your dry sift turns out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people make sift like this,
and that's all they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do gentle, gentle siftings,
get a pure product, but they don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: know how to clean product that is already
contaminated or product that's been run in
[SPEAKER_03]: a pollinator or a tumbler or a tumble now.
[SPEAKER_03]: These products tend to be highly
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're contaminated between 50 and 90%
contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the secondary part of this
process really comes in, the carding.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things between this process and
just taking it and say you got a handful
[SPEAKER_04]: like this, and instead of doing it gently,
you go like this, and you got the powdery
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, and you got like that, and you
start sifting it like that, what the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference is, is the length of time of
cleaning it up, period, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pain in the ass that takes a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the carding technique, it absolutely
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really right now the technique
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a multitude of techniques that you
can learn to be very gentle and to get an
[SPEAKER_03]: initial, very clean sift, but there's
really not that many methods for getting
[SPEAKER_03]: dirty resin clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right at this point in time,
the technique I teach, this carding
[SPEAKER_03]: technique that we'll be doing here in a
bit, it's slow and it's steady and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: patient work, but you get the results,
and Darren's hash is a clear indication of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you spent quite a bit of time in the
last four months making dry sift?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, September is when I got it,
when I got my screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, well that's five months now.
[SPEAKER_04]: End of September.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, four and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: August was when, August, September was
when I was down there, and you guys turned
[SPEAKER_04]: me on to the dry sift, showed me exactly
what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, puffed a bowl with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, watched it completely melt like
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pretty much, pretty much put me
on my ass, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like really fucking high, instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The taste, the flavors, the
non-carcinogens, everything going into
[SPEAKER_04]: your body from the leaf material,
everything like that was gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was turned on to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I wanted to do was make your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: My own because I have good enough friends
that have their medical licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my medical license as well to
possess and do my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it definitely helps that both Darren
and I are federally exempt and we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: actually breaking any laws right now doing
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just, luckily for our Canadian
exemption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're in British Columbia and we're
allowed to extract the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that federally exempt
people in the rest of Canada are not
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to do, which is ridiculous
because, you know, to let someone use
[SPEAKER_03]: something as a medicine and then not
actually extract the medicine to a purity
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's actually useful seems somewhat
counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way it is sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm going to give them a little
bit of a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give them a little,
show them a little bit of your technique
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just drop it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the stuff intact so you don't end up
with a bunch of powder on the bottom of it
[SPEAKER_04]: because like leaf matter, because that
stuff goes through, dirties it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know when you get down to the fine
stuff like this, right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to keep that on there too
long while you're doing this because this
[SPEAKER_04]: is the stuff that is going to get
contaminated through there and contaminate
[SPEAKER_04]: your.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I card that off immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleanliness is godliness as my mentor,
Skunk the Sam man once, or Sam the Skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: man once told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time, you know, you can do it every
second time depending on how much of this
[SPEAKER_04]: you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, for the first run,
if you want it to be the best you can have
[SPEAKER_04]: it, do it every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have yourself a clean surface every
time you take a handful of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you know how long the material was
dried?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this has been dried for two,
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd still like it to set up in the freezer
after I've done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: After I've made the dry sift though,
to let it set up better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this, the beginning took me about
three weeks to get the full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unmistakably full melt dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was at the one, I thought I
was there at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took you a while, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent you a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, here you go,
full melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was probably after a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks, a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was because it was close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten days, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was closer to finding out what I needed
to do then than I was to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is important to listen to because
you really have to reassign your
[SPEAKER_03]: definition of what full melt is when
you're trying hard to get full melt dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's so much harder than pulling
bags when the water does all the work of
[SPEAKER_03]: separating out all the chafe from the
gland heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like more of an art form and you
really have to clean the gland heads out
[SPEAKER_03]: from everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, when it first
sizzles just a little bit after a week of
[SPEAKER_03]: carding and working, you think,
man, that's the melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was only the sizzle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the sizzle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when I messaged my buddy,
sent him the video and text back,
[SPEAKER_04]: he sent me that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting to sizzle, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it took a great big like like a
bow and arrow, clang, boom, out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: balloon and popped my balloon of I did it
because I didn't do it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bubble man's persistence and your
persistence and my persistence on doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not wanting to give up because I just hate
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I made a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted it up on 10 days later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 10 days, like 10 days later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't expect to get it 20 minutes
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like here, here this 10 days after he did
it for 10 days and thought he had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you get to that spot,
what I was doing here, so played a bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: a that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using I was I was using the tunnel
now and using it for a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_04]: than I needed to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was putting more work on yourself,
making more work on myself and constantly
[SPEAKER_04]: carding that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus there was also the thing of not
knowing exactly what I what I needed to
[SPEAKER_04]: use.
[SPEAKER_04]: These cards here are a key essential piece
to decontaminating your product and the
[SPEAKER_04]: final end of it, because you can use it at
any given time you want through the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll show you later on on what I do
with my with the screens that I got and
[SPEAKER_04]: how this is a key player in every fucking
step of this man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to show you with the macro
lens, not just this regular lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to be like those types
that like to hold out and stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you the secret later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to show you and you're going
to love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's key.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not stressing enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a little bit more work
in here with the leaf and then we'll come
[SPEAKER_03]: back and we'll get to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to we're going to make some
bubble hash tonight, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to just a few hundred
grams just to show you guys what we can do
[SPEAKER_04]: with my bone dry stuff that that it can
melt nicely to
[SPEAKER_03]: do your thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll just let it have we'll just take
the easiest heads to get off of this here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knock the fucking heads out of that bucket
that are sticking to the walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be too rough with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, you know, you can be in a rush,
but you can't be with this because this
[SPEAKER_04]: can't be when it comes to this slow and
gentle is actually the best process if you
[SPEAKER_04]: want the purest heads in the quickest way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you don't, you rough it up and
you get all that all this little dark
[SPEAKER_04]: material that's on the bottom here,
you know, all this kind of stuff that gets
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminated in there if you use it to if
you do too much of this that we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: taking the best of heads right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let the tumble now do the
rest of the work for separating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's more work to be done
sifting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even by then, there's by no means
is all the resin going to be off.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a first stage dry sifting gets off
a certain amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble bags are obviously much more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then final processes like coconut oil
or moonshine oil would be the next,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, surefire way of extracting,
you know, 99.9% of the cannabinoids from
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's really nice is that it's cold in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in the north, so it's chilly.
[SPEAKER_04]: My shop is cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too cold, but cold enough that we got
a little extra bonus feature when we make
[SPEAKER_04]: our hash up here in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon as I'm done mixing, doing a little
bit of sifting on this, the little gentle
[SPEAKER_04]: touch, we're going to have my friend,
my two friends come up here and help me
[SPEAKER_04]: lift the screen off and replace it with
the bottom one, put it on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give a nice brushing all around
these screens and clean all the leaf up
[SPEAKER_03]: before we even attempt to lift this screen
and pull out the resin cleaned screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleanliness is the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to clean it out if
you're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to clean it out of
your dry sift instead of just sweeping it
[SPEAKER_04]: off the edge all nice like you could have
in the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sometimes when people are rough
with their shit, I just can't help it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dry sift, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be gentle like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making love to it, not fucking
fucking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to get off that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm dropping the F on like how many?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 15 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making a hash, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got nice material.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush or?
[SPEAKER_04]: OG Kush trim, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fan leaves are all picked off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is sugar for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we'll go set the camera
up on the tripod and get ready for,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually I'm going to keep the camera nice
and close for when the screen lifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Important step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything you drop from the edge of this
thing, no matter how careful you think
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to be, you're still going to
have to pull it out of your dry sift
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're fucked up by not cleaning
it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the last step for that card.
Weird.
Weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Static.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original ones I gave with the bubble
box were insane how much they did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were like, man, these cards are
just getting covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, they're static cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people, I don't know, couldn't get the
hang of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ended up putting the different card
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any of the other cards left?
[SPEAKER_04]: The old ones there in the old stock?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd like a box of them myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleaning this up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, what I'm going to do, I'm going to
take this off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to dump it and clean it up a
little bit before we put it on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we have our resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Optimally, you'd want to use an air hose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, forced air works good for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, guys, can I get you guys to give me a
hand here for a second?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you to run each side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just lift up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll slide this out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put her down where this one was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: On to the next stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when I like to start pulling out
the little gadgets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, first things first for me,
I get hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do see some right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
get my tweezers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to tell you a trick?
Sure.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: A balloon rubbed on your head and ran
across that resin before it's moved and
[SPEAKER_03]: disturbed will pull out hairs and dust and
debris with static electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know how you can rub a balloon
and stick it to the wall?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing I got grandkids and have
balloons.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think I have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you don't have to do it
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's definitely like a future trick
that you can play around with.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we came inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to hit the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some bubble hash, OG Kush,
and dry sift OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we hit the D-nail at 810?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to turn it down a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taste of your ribs, maybe?
[SPEAKER_03]: 750?
[SPEAKER_04]: 760.
[SPEAKER_04]: 760.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it's at a lower temperature,
you get more flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: 766.
[SPEAKER_04]: 766 it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: 767.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a palindrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we may do another round.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see you outside for some more
dry sifting and some more importantly,
[SPEAKER_03]: tips on how to get your dry sift clean to
99% pure blind heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we're back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just had a fresh D-nail rip of some dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full mouth dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we're going to clean this
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This resin's fallen down from the 100
lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 110 lines per inch was about 150
microns.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fallen onto this 200, which is a 70
micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you want to take us a little
through your personalized process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I've got to this stage, depending on
your resin heads that you're getting and
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're using, you're either looking
at like when we took pictures and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, it'd be like you're saying
about 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, to me, what I've seen in my
experience from using the resin heads from
[SPEAKER_04]: the material I used before, which was
using UV rays to produce more resin heads,
[SPEAKER_04]: found more resin heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting more like 80%, 75%,
85% heads better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the same thing as here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were better heads in that sort of
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are hash making strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are strains that have grown better
than others that just are perfect for
[SPEAKER_03]: sifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk Man Sam's talked about it forever,
how his skunk is an ultimate producer,
[SPEAKER_03]: and when he makes resin with that,
it just rains hard and it rains pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sleet stack was another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crossed that DNA genetic sleet stack
with his skunk, and it was also an uber
[SPEAKER_03]: producer of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This here strain we're using is an OG Kush
strain done by one of my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does a medical garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives me some of the sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stanky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love playing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love smoking and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got a good bouquet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's uber strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, OG Kush obviously is a great
strain to make hash with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, what we've got now is because
we've got about 50% contaminant,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to have to do some carding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to take the camera off the
tripod for that, and it'll just be kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: close up of Darren working and carding the
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll do some...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do you think would you give an
idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't even know what's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe 10 grams or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll take me a good hour and a half
probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 to 15 grams, going to turn that down to
like five to seven with the 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminant that's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important for people who are
watching because they don't really... Did
[SPEAKER_03]: you have any idea that it would take that
kind of time?
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole part of the take and the time
was those little tiny, tiny particulates
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can't get out without a
microscope or one of those knitting...
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the big magnification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are great for hash making if you
could get a big square that big and have
[SPEAKER_03]: one of these lights shining right down on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the lights and one lens over here,
jewelry glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got them ordered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of pair ordered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty close down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer a custom big fat square that you
could just put your hands under and work
[SPEAKER_03]: with your little tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually making a coffee table out of
it and incorporate that into it just for
[SPEAKER_04]: my own personal... Yeah, it's a good idea,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, back to the particulates.
[SPEAKER_04]: When my biggest problem, when I was first
doing it, it took me like three weeks to
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out how to get the clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the material I was using,
which is this material right now as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm going to have to do is what I
stumbled across is iTunes cards are very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very staticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: The back of the iTunes card.
[SPEAKER_03]: The iTunes card comes on this,
does it not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is... Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: The iTunes card comes onto this,
stuck onto this like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you pull it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: $15 card.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what hangs on the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is the card that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either side you use is going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're running it one way,
it's going to do what we're going to show
[SPEAKER_04]: you on the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll explain it to you in very fine
detail and show you exactly how it's done
[SPEAKER_04]: with this card here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you stumbled across, it doesn't
have to just be this one, but this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: one I stumbled across.
[SPEAKER_04]: A certain type of plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just cleaned it right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that holds a static charge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really kind of like the more static
charge, the more you're going to attract
[SPEAKER_03]: things to the card.
[SPEAKER_04]: One side is going to attract particulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other side is going to attract pretty
much pure resin heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be some pestilent
hairs and stuff like that in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll show you exactly what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to get him to start
working some of the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to grab the camera and give you
a better view.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we'll be right back with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back with Darren.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to start working the resin on
the bottom screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a nice sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely hear that it's not 80%
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That scratchy sound on the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granule, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll only hear that sound improve as
you improve the purity of your resin
[SPEAKER_03]: heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what we're doing here,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand the quality has already been
decided.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now deciding the purity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And purity plus quality equals full melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to pick out some hairs when I see
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep a pair of tweezers on hand,
always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those hairs don't just come off,
do they?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This might clean up quicker than an hour
and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: But count on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that, and it's probably going
to take me fucking two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Murphy's law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what I'm doing here is I like to just
drag the card over to take the first layer
[SPEAKER_04]: of stuff off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because underneath that layer,
it's like gold and dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The gold nuggets are going to fall down
more, and the dirt's going to stay on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm staying... You mean the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dirt's going to fall down through,
and the gold nuggets will stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean in the pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it's like this, I'm just going to
scrape the top layer off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And underneath, it's going to be more
granule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll pile that up into a separate pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it's always easier to clean small
piles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always want to get... You hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's different here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give her a flick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're always flicking your screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give her a little tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always have a tool in my hand like that,
and I crack my card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this stuff here is... You can hear
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear it just scratching.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that noise because I know I'm close
to what I want to get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give it a pause.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to photograph that with
the macro lens and see if that is indeed a
[SPEAKER_03]: higher percentage of heads and a lower
percentage of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how I like to...
[SPEAKER_04]: I just work my way from this side all the
way over to the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I've mentioned what this
process is, and this is sort of the simple
[SPEAKER_03]: process that so many people didn't know
over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know this over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is carding.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gently pushing down on the resin
and spreading it across the screen not too
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly in a nice, cold environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you're going to do is you're
going to push through the capitate stalks,
[SPEAKER_03]: the systolic hairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get that hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to push up hairs to the
top as you card the resin as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any contaminant stands out,
and the more you clean it, funny enough,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more the contaminant stands out,
the more you get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll do a run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do one side all the way from the top
to the bottom on one grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get all this other little stuff here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a look at the card and see how
much contaminant there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just take this and put it over to the
side.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little pile up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I do on the other side is
I'm going to leave that on for some
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to leave the rest of it on the
other side for pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to show you this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I'll take this stuff and I'll
have a spot on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do it with my little screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to leave this on because this will
be a good picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, once I've made this little
pile of this stuff, like, trust me,
[SPEAKER_04]: after you do this for two, three months,
the pile of this stuff you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have is going to be fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you clean that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just needs a slight cleaning and it's
just crazy good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So clean and it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't know, you need to find
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to find someone that you know
that does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to find some screens and order
them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, get in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in touch with us at Fresh Hetties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always down to help answer
questions, whether you want to get your
[SPEAKER_03]: own screens made or you need the sizes or
you want to learn about the information,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll gladly sell you the tools as well at
FreshHetties.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always... I'm going to leave this
one for some pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to start with a new card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, once again, iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking rule, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: These cards are the whole key that I
stumbled across that helps me clean my
[SPEAKER_04]: product the fastest when you're carding
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't really press too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually just let the weight of the card
do the work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be why it might be taking
you a long time, because I particularly...
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to press a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't press really hard, but I kind of
do a sort of this style thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to clean on this side?
[SPEAKER_03]: iTunes down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would kind of do like this sort of
thing, because you got to really push that
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminant through and the heads are
stronger than you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't want to push them too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you see, that's something I did not
know, because we've never got to get
[SPEAKER_04]: together just like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like something you can play
around with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another tool to add to the
arsenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put in a little more pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would just literally spread it
thin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually work this much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would usually work... I would clean a
section of screen and I would go through
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe something like this for starters,
where I could spread it thin and just sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of start working it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might work that for 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then put over a little pile and then,
you know, get more and put that in a
[SPEAKER_03]: separate pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I get a bunch of little piles and
I start cleaning through those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what you get on your heads here,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, you really get... A nice color on
that one side, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just something that I really love
so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you see the way the lines are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a smooth transition anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you got stuff on your card
you need to clean off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'll take.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I see that happen, I'll take my card.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll clean off the side that needs to be
cleaned off from the contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have my pile and I'll start my pile
over somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just say in the corner here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll see all this stuff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the little residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's melted bumps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's gonna fuck shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good to keep your card clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you need to just have a bunch of
them present or, you know, you can
[SPEAKER_03]: really...
[SPEAKER_04]: See the difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every minute or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the difference?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bunch of lines in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good when you're sifting,
too, to bang your card and clear it of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, things that it might hold
because those things... If your card's
[SPEAKER_03]: picking up a lot of stuff, and you
continue to card with that card,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll melt that stuff to the card.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just inevitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to collect it on the
cards, then just have, like, a collection
[SPEAKER_03]: of cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing with the iTunes cards,
too, that I like...
[SPEAKER_04]: You can flip it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the bottom side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got a good amount of space on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bigger than your average card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, to go over this process
again, the carding is pushing through
[SPEAKER_03]: breakable, brittle contaminant,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_03]: cystalith hairs, capitate stalks,
small particles of leaf, broken pieces of
[SPEAKER_03]: pistolet hairs, and dirt and debris and
hairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, hairs are generally easiest to pick
out with the help of static electricity
[SPEAKER_03]: using a balloon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can rub that on your head if you're
not bald and hold the balloon over the
[SPEAKER_03]: screen, and it'll pull small hairs and
little bits of dust out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The carding technique will do the rest,
which is going to push through the
[SPEAKER_03]: breakable contaminant while the strong
gland heads, they'll stay right on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with some decent pressure,
you won't push the trichomes through the
[SPEAKER_03]: gland heads, the trichome heads,
through a screen that is tighter than the
[SPEAKER_03]: diamond diameter of said trichome head.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we won't show you this whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked quite a bit about what's
going to happen here, what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: continuing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren's telling you a little bit about
his process and what he's sort of created
[SPEAKER_03]: or started to do for himself from the
basics that he learned through fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: headies and myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we kind of hope for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to set a simple parameter,
get you guys producing melty resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then from there, once you have that
foundation of producing 98, 95% pure gland
[SPEAKER_03]: heads, then you can start really playing
and experimenting from there because
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got a good foundation and you know
where you're supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know if you're playing is leading you
away from there or leading you above
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you keep at it and be patient,
trust me, I don't have the most patience
[SPEAKER_04]: in the world, but it was very much worth
it on every angle, on every level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't express it more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is just... It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we'll continue to clean
here at the resin and we'll get back to
[SPEAKER_03]: you with some macroscopic photographs of
the final cleaned product and of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: some de-nail melt hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep watching Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate your comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate your views.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget to go follow Darren at
Mr. D420K on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, I'll have the link in the
comment of this particular YouTube video,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can just go click the link.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren, D420K, just went to collect some
plants, just some branches that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while he was gone, lo and behold,
I took all his dry sift that he had here
[SPEAKER_03]: and I cleaned it up into little piles of
contaminant, more contaminant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course, our favorite,
there's the 170 micron and here's the 120
[SPEAKER_03]: micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to be very happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably, you know, five to 10
grams or four to five, four to 10 grams in
[SPEAKER_03]: each pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this one's much slower,
maybe only a couple of grams in this pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But very nice, nice little thing to do for
a buddy, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean up his dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, as you guys know, I teach the
carding method.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always taught this method for the
last several years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how many years now,
but it's an effective method to clean the
[SPEAKER_03]: glandular heads and it's what Darren's
gotten very good at and I just thought I
[SPEAKER_03]: would treat him to a little bit of a
secret and sort of, you know, I've learned
[SPEAKER_03]: another method in the last six months that
is not really my method to share,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm allowed to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I basically cleaned these piles of dry
sift up for Darren.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that beautiful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I hope he's going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome back to Bulb Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finishing up the dry sift video
today with D420K.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually out of here in a couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm flying out, but I still want to
photograph those nuggets that you brought
[SPEAKER_03]: by those freshies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those will look really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what strains did we get there?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the OG Kush, we got the Brooklyn
Mango and the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so those three will be coming up in
macro photography living hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing crazily too with the UV rays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you know, we're going to finish up
the dry sift video.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last installment of the dry
sift video.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have Darren go outside and
just basically show the process that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been sharing for the last couple of years
of Howie cards, and sort of his little
[SPEAKER_03]: tricks and techniques and stuff,
the cards that he uses and his brushes and
[SPEAKER_03]: such.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about the screens and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when he was away and he went and got
the cut branches, I actually took a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of his dry sift and I cleaned it up for
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, up here in the background,
we have piles of kind of what it looked
[SPEAKER_03]: like originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, there are heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here stuff out of the tumbler.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all below 70 microns in size.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are also some contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: These, these here would be actually
smokable and or medical much stronger than
[SPEAKER_03]: this particular one, even though to the
naked eye, this is looks garbagey and this
[SPEAKER_03]: is lighter in color.
[SPEAKER_03]: But clearly these two piles, this one was
on top of a 120 screen that I took off and
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one was on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up of a 70 micron screen that I took off
and cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was able to use a method that I
picked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically a method that I'm not in a
position to share just yet, but I hope one
[SPEAKER_03]: day that I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promised obviously my mentor,
Skunkman Sam, that I would not mention it
[SPEAKER_03]: or show the method I should say,
but I am allowed to use the method.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's respect, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me 19 years to learn such a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I've learned it, I'm just
going to be very respectful and just,
[SPEAKER_03]: I give all the props to Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to earn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge thing to look down at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks surreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever felt hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is another game, another game
changer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's, it feels wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, why don't we do a little dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: We could like, you know, like this here,
we'll just, I can't get it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might as well do this for the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a simple half second of a pinch
and this stuff turns into almost
[SPEAKER_03]: transparent see-through dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make a little video for you guys so
you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we'll get back into the shop
here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren will do a little bit of his
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show you what he cleaned under the
macro lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show you a little bit of what I
cleaned under the macro lens and we'll you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, we'll say thanks to Prince George
for having us and we'll look forward to
[SPEAKER_03]: the next time we get to come back here
because it's been a great trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Met some awesome people sledding yesterday
with Noodles and Jake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just all Darren's friends are just all
really good, good guys all around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prince George ain't so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that not surreal?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pure goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard D420 pull up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went to grab some branches for me to
photograph with the macro camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let him in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what you got there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's uh, there's some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some Brooklyn Mango and some
Babakush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was hoping I'd get pulled over so
I could say, fuck off, copper,
[SPEAKER_04]: get away from my medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go get D-nail rips and I'll
get my camera ready and we'll photograph
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here with the fresh nuggets that
are the fresh branches that D420K went and
[SPEAKER_03]: cut to photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are like untouched,
absolutely epic, beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This here is OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guys just the formula,
the lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is grown for the trichromes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as much and as big a trichromes you can
get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way they do this is pretty fat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't use a thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't use thousand waters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use six hundreds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use UV rays, UV lights that hangs all
over the place because that's key to
[SPEAKER_04]: building.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are incredible at what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to throw that one in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: She broke off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now where would you like to put it so that
we don't have to put it back in?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to take some good pictures of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything set up right off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just put it on the box here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, the way it is,
it can lay anywhere and I can just come
[SPEAKER_03]: over and as you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's enough of it that won't be
touching that it'll be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then what is this one here?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fox tailing out up top there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm going to get to photographing
these right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's show them a branch of each one at
least.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to Brooklyn next?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a side branch too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a top.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a side branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The incredible density on this guy is
really big, giant, fat, two liter size.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to hold because it's so heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbelievable resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at these and all of the families
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the dry soaps in Washington
would be so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez, Bubba is one sweet lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: One sweet bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have the Brooklyn Mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something we're very, very happy
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's old school looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally different structural, totally
completely different herb altogether,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yet really pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost reminds me of some of Skunkman
Sam's skunk because this is the way it
[SPEAKER_03]: grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just grew a nugget with very little
leaf and before anyone had anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: it, he had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He bred it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were flipping out over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I first saw this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, old school, because it's all bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see this one, two, three,
four, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can count the leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to get the sugar leaf from
this and then have the flavors of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Brooklyn Mango, the Bubba Kush and the OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get to shooting right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just too excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get my macro lens going and
we'll see what's going on in these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: V420K here doing the last video of the dry
sift, the final stage on Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_04]: World with Bubble Man right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm here guys, just off camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dee's going to explain to you guys the
final step in the process and how he gets
[SPEAKER_03]: his heady, heady dry sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: My final step anyways that I got from you
and this is where I like to finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do the big screens, but I like to
sit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a screen in front of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the big screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the stereo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can enjoy, sit down, relax and do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this side is the side that I use my
brush, use my card.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are my two favorite tools for the 70
screen, but I'm taking my final product
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sifting it across.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll drag it across like we were showing
last night and do our thing with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we do that, the card will get dirty.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with a nice clean edge here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take your product and as you go,
you use only one side to drag it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other side, don't drag it with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you do that, it's with these cards
I find the most is where I get the most
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I attract the most contaminant on this
side of my card.
[SPEAKER_04]: On this side of my card, I'll take after
I've got some contaminant on it and I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: just brush it off over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it to the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: This side has nice clean looking stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of, there's lots of dirt like
contaminant in there too, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaf matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the stocks that hold the resin gland
and the resin glands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take that all together and I'll take
that aside and I'll just put it on a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after working this for probably 10
hours or three weeks or so, you've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: nice pile of that really pure looking
stuff clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can clean that up afterwards
and get some nice clean stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I'm doing that, I'm cleaning this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this card really attracts the
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took off probably hours worth of
sifting for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: After I sit for a few minutes,
I look at the card, contaminant,
[SPEAKER_04]: boom, I take it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to do that every time with
this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it build up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to scrape it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all over to the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moved it onto the one side, that pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice pile on the card.
[SPEAKER_04]: More contaminant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get that off.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it's pushing it through the screens
and taking more time doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quickens the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stress it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any type of card that attracts a static
electricity will do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is one of your best friends when
it comes to carding your sift,
[SPEAKER_04]: period.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to lose too much of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some really nice buildup on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see that, bubble man?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take that, just put it back in the
pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just leave that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just get back to going back and forth
on my sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use more pressure for sure on your
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it depends on if that screen is
touching.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far is that screen from underneath the
plate that it's on?
[SPEAKER_03]: About that much space?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then that's plenty enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely, especially because
it's cold in here, where that process of
[SPEAKER_03]: what I did yesterday, which was hold the
card even more flat rather than just use
[SPEAKER_03]: the edge of the card.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hold it down and use like a third of
the card and really pancake it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That process in a cold environment works
fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can be fairly, not overly,
but fairly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually really press decently on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the bottom line is that the resin
heads are strong, and they will stay on
[SPEAKER_03]: top.
[SPEAKER_03]: The contaminant will break and be brittle,
especially in the cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll push through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't push through easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where it comes through that you
have to do this over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at how dark it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark side, light side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, clear as day.
[SPEAKER_03]: One's green and one's gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this stuff here, you can still do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took this stuff here and used Bubba
Mad's method, you would definitely get
[SPEAKER_04]: some more out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we photographed it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll inlay that photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely glandular heads still
on the greener side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just tends to pick up more of the
contaminant on that side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, basically the process is long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tedious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's patient work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the basic thing that I'm showing is
that you're carding the resin over the
[SPEAKER_03]: screen, back and forth, back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: In doing that with resin as you play,
like Darren has, you'll learn your own
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques that won't work for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren's trip, he's learned that this card
thing makes things easier for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It collects resin and contaminant and
separates it for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, he's going to institute
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we're going to share it
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyone else out there that's learning
this technique of carding, anything you
[SPEAKER_03]: learn, please come share it with us on
Team Dry Sift on our Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even as a comment in one of the YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear from you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, guys, for everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a slice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope to learn more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like Bubba Mad said, if there's stuff
you're learning, please share.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on D.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been four days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an awesome trip to Prince
George.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say, this guy right here knows
how to host a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: He showed me his town.
[SPEAKER_03]: He introduced me to his friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: He showed me his Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been a great trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, totally stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was our pleasure every minute of the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're definitely going to hang out
with you soon again when you come to
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I hope you guys all enjoyed
watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope you guys make your way to
Prince George.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day and check out D420K on his
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. D420K on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'll have his shop up sooner than
later on his website.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned for that.
Thanks for watching.
