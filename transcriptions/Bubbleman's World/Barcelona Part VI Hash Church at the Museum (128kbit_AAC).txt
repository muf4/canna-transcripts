[SPEAKER_01]: It's 418.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're going to make the
museum in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are, I'm here with Todd and Lauren.
[SPEAKER_01]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to head down to the Hemp
and Hash Museum, Ben Dronker's museum,
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful museum that he has here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do a little hash
church.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys will probably see a hash
church before you see this, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: come back and watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch this, our little journey to the Hemp
and Hash Museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just have that in your favorites?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I do right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're set up to rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're getting your 420 split ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we are, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Noel did a little thing he was
telling me yesterday where he put everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: in handcuffs and told them they only had
six minutes in the back of the police car
[SPEAKER_01]: with their weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they could roll a joint and smoke
it fast enough, they'd get away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little publicity stunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, he said after he was done,
people were actually coming up to him with
[SPEAKER_01]: their own weed and asking if they could be
handcuffed to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is quite funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude, it made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know what, Noel,
you're a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an aversion to handcuffs because
I've had them so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Noel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know Noel's story?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you been handcuffed?
[SPEAKER_01]: When he escaped the Spanish authorities
and jumped off the 50 foot wall into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know his story?
That is pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, listen, his story is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the camera, guys, just for the
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mansions all the way to the street end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Palaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beverly Hills got the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, quite a bit, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: jeez, I'm glad I'm going to be spending a
bit of time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barely seen you guys since I've been here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this is not the one I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is not the street I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn right, then turn left, Carrera Plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to run over humans,
you know?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did do the stop symbol and then
say go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I was like, that's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at first I was waving that it was
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peace sign was pretty much for work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a hippie gang sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, little boy, you should look up when
you walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like walking with a brace and a cast.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trip, this is see this where it says
museum museum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, now I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my thought is, is that I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop for a minute, we unload and then I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's unload.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's unload our boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a live Google stream here
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either or this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of space you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some seats and a little table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll turn the music off for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, what a nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the musical room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The musical room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can begin for the first room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Sabbath right on the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful building.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because we lied to them in the 90s
when we wanted to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just said, no, no, it's a different
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is where we explain that it's
the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a classic old photo right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a little tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bike room, the old master room
with all the paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these paintings talk about the
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follower of Hendrick, Martin, Sora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers drinking and smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got their pipes in their hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1650 to 1670 for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a proper museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really.
In the past, this room was for the dance,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is a great thing to do
for this room, the pipe room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, what a collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how we saved our history.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of this would be lost?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's a big pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: From Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that is a ceremonial pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally impressed with the quality of the
art and the collection that Ben Dronkers
[SPEAKER_01]: has amassed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing job, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Barcelona, I urge you to come
here and check out the Marimona and Hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to start Hash Church in the
next hour here, but I'm going to take you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys on a little bit more of a tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be post-Columbus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sailing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The depiction of one of the ships of
Columbus.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the oak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, where's the eight-foot
backstrap loom?
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
Incredible, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the loom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what they call this right
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardest job known to man, you'll never
see a man doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, strong arms on those women.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strong, strong ladies right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I'd spin all day long compared to
doing that work right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at the combing that afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, they got it done though, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very impressive museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole deal right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: From spinning your yarn to looming to your
canvas.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, babe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that old break.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's the break right there on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to break some hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: What an
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's the car parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's the decorticator, the Champion
2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought our, not the decorticator,
the harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: The harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought one of those from Manitoba,
and we brought over a Dutch guy to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 95 when we got our first hemp
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just made a decorticator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in tension right now in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There he is.
That's exactly it.
And what we're going to do is we're going
to make a secret cut.
But it's an entry to say the whole
spinning theater we're going to make.
We're going to cut the hair.
That would be that way.
The cups and the hair right there.
It's going to be really interesting to see
what we're going to do with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and show you what
we're going to do with that.
I'm going to go ahead and show you what
we're going to do with that.
