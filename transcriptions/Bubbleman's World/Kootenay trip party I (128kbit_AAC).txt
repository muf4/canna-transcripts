[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about five in the morning here in
British Columbia and I am just getting
[SPEAKER_07]: ready to head over to the Vancouver
International Airport where I will be
[SPEAKER_07]: flying into the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to head up to Castlegar and then
drive from Castlegar to Casley.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe check out Winlaw and definitely
check out Nelson.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got all my stuff packed up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got my trippy sticks ready to go so I
can puff all the way to the airport.
[SPEAKER_07]: Being a federally exempt Canadian,
I'm legally allowed to transport medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a tiny little bit of maybe three of
these little bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposed to be stink-proof.
[SPEAKER_07]: They aren't.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're definitely going to be smelling
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I have my actual airtight,
watertight air med-tainer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is filled with nuggets as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course I have a nice amount of
full-melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got myself about 20 grams stuffed
into a nice little container here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I've got my big 4x4 screens that
we're going to be using while we're over
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be making a bunch of
different bubble and dry sift but I just
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to start us off.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be heading to the airport
next so stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, a little bit of snow fell last
night.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little driveway.
A little bit of snow fell last night.
A little bit of snow fell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the down breaks open many years too
soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's no room up on the hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're unexplored with dark
foreboding too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you on the dark side of the moon.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lunatic is in my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lunatic is in my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: You raise the blade.
[SPEAKER_08]: You make the change.
You rearrange me till I'm sane.
You lock the door.
[SPEAKER_08]: And throw away the key.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's someone in my head but it's not
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just parked my car and I am
waiting for the bus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I see is right over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got my stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: My 4x2 screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: My D-nail, the mothership.
[SPEAKER_07]: All my bubble and my herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm heading to Caslo.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a cold, wintery morning but well,
here comes my bus.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it turning and I see it coming this
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nice quick flight to Caslo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only one hour in the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be quick to clear customs or
security and make my way forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have my trippy stick as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, it's never a bad idea to have
your trippy stick with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medication on the go.
[SPEAKER_05]: As John B.
[SPEAKER_05]: says, here comes the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll catch up with you soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just heading up to the departure
for domestic flights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be getting our bags put in and getting
over to boarding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just got my boarding pass and put
my baggages away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gonna put this card away now and we'll
make our way to security.
So,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty quick clearing of security.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even really check my bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm heading on to the plane now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be in Caslo in about an hour and a
half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we're here at the airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trippy sticking away and just waiting for
the bird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Waiting for the bird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta love B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're just waiting for some
de-icing to occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes the de-icer now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Frank?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see ya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really young plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaving my house to driving on the
highway.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just little clips.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, driving through the cooties with my
buddy Frank.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just left Nelson.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are at Six Mile and there's the... Oh
yes, the can filter complex is right up
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The original can filter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see what is...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm gonna go with only small size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small size turnable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small size.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go with this half large and half
long.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Ron.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're just on the Caslo ferry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes about five minutes to cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it take?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two minutes to cross?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are now getting very close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlocked by four blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Osprey.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Osprey 2000.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really good to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw my groceries down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if we can go find Ron.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see he's got some bubble bags on the TV
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fun to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just putting my Pelican down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go see what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna turn the lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna turn the lights on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let her wake up first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all sleeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just turn the lights on for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, they're all laying down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, then we're gonna go inside and
we're gonna have a session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked that up at the concert in Toronto
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, got this for you too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your high times cannabis cup pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this is just a little silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a room key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pull that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was nice, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a grinder for your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a little grinder.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just take your buds and grind them
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that ever cool, eh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you on, buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're back in Ron's kitchen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even really introduce Ron.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Ron.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ron was my mentor and he taught me how
to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And more than that, he kind of taught me
how to be like he groomed me to become the
[SPEAKER_07]: bubble man in reality because really he's
the most extreme off the wall,
[SPEAKER_07]: over the top person you could ever
possibly know.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's movies to be made about all of
that statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meantime, he kind of inspired
me to be like a crazy, wild, like not in a
[SPEAKER_07]: bad way, but you know, like in the way
that we love the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you directed your wild and better
than I did mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild is wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to have good people to help with
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we're going to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: We came in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron just did some interviews on camera,
talked a little bit about how he does his
[SPEAKER_07]: growing, talked a little bit about lights
and air and flushing the plants and just a
[SPEAKER_07]: whole bunch of stuff that we'll show on
the video.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to hit this because I'm
jonesing for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again, Denial, Stevie, Brian,
and K9.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, K9, for the sweet carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for it, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice,
[SPEAKER_07]: yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cap that, pour that on me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: You knew it, Dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: This machine sure is worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water shifts with the D-mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go for a ride on the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will take you to places no man has been
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it all depends on what you put in
the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: It delivers it so nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice the way you can kind of get that
last bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that carb cap is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're going to maybe make some
food, talk pots, talk hash, maybe get
[SPEAKER_07]: dry-sinking a little later on,
but we'll catch up with you guys in a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers.
