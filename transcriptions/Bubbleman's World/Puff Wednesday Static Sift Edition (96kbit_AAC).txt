[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that Johnny fucking B?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just figured I'd hang out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, what are you doing out on my deck
with all your screens and my kitchen
[SPEAKER_07]: table?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, eight for one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking rights, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to see you, or half of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to see half of Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: He used to be much more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he's less.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when Johnny's less, he's still more.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot more.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's still more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's more of me now that
there's less of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So listen, right off the bat, this is a
very exciting video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Been waiting to do this for a while now.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the quintessential dry sift video.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about the dry sift
wizard's methodology that he uses with the
[SPEAKER_07]: 60 and the 90 mesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about the 200 and the
110, which I've been showing for quite a
[SPEAKER_07]: while with carding, which kind of came
into this static thing with a DVD and some
[SPEAKER_07]: parchment, thanks to me's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then that kind of grew and people,
I think Jungle Boys and some other people
[SPEAKER_07]: were wrapping paint rollers and parchment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then recently, Steven Marrick from
Team Dry Sift was really posting a lot on
[SPEAKER_07]: my Facebook group about this nitrile glove
method.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had seen it over the last couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just glimpses of the picture of the glove
with resin on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone had sent it to me on Instagram and
I never really thought much about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lo and behold, Steven came on to
Team Dry Sift and was really getting into
[SPEAKER_07]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The process is going to be shared with you
here today.
[SPEAKER_07]: John has some absolutely spectacular
looking cannabis that he brought over in
[SPEAKER_07]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's freshly hung.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us a little bit about your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we know what's great about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of knew I was coming here,
so you should check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm getting a hand here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry sifting, so check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: 57 degrees, 45%.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the form of cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to grab a screen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddy's going to help me grab a screen
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to grab a 200U screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that one's damaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to find another 200U
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go grab a screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put this in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go head over to Mark's
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to grab a 200U screen and
we're going to head over to Bubba's place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to grab these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put them into bins and
we're going to get going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my friend here helping me out just
because I can't actually do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be the... Oh my God,
I just drew a complete blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you guys about it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been hanging for four months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smell anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to get this going here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that you guys saw that,
you get what we're working with here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also going to show you a little bit
of footage with the camera up close of
[SPEAKER_07]: each of the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go through those
cultivars right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I packed these up at the house
and after four and a half month hang,
[SPEAKER_04]: you guessed it, four and a half month
cure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, nice cardboard box, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like these?
[SPEAKER_04]: All nice and it's still cool inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel how nice and cold it is in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is called the biscotti.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the biscotti?
[SPEAKER_04]: That one there.
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: They aren't?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's biscotti cake and this here
is the medi.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the med?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and this is biscotti cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a biscotti cross cake and you
can see it's just like, it's just glowing
[SPEAKER_04]: with crystals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really just like,
and now when you get a really good look at
[SPEAKER_04]: these strains and like, I just can't,
I, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my glasses on, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it looks nice, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is four and a half month cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is proper hang dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is no screwing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is slow cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when you talked about dry sift and
what I listened, when a skunk man sound
[SPEAKER_04]: was talking about how like the three or
four month cure was truly the resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shrinking the head before you go do the
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you do the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, things happen and,
and, you know, flooding in Abbotsford.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I wind up hurting my back and
that's why they've been hanging for so
[SPEAKER_04]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was meant to be truly meant to
be on this strain here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to put these ones away first?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have room to pull those ones out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to keep them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cold, although it is nice and cool out
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's definitely not a warm day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the first bounce in that box.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at that and I'm like,
that's why I put them in these brand new
[SPEAKER_04]: boxes guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it's like first bounce is just
the most amazing and you can see how that
[SPEAKER_04]: happens there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get these going,
but you can just see lots of good resin
[SPEAKER_04]: coming off of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to throw some of this in here
just in case we want to do some fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that some, uh, this is pink
goo and that's just like killer guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little pink goo, little Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be, that's more pink goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that looks like some more pink goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see the color of it and the
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the cookies crossed with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a BC Bud Depot run.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was animal cookies from BC Bud
Depot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can definitely see that in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just see how that is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has got a real creamy flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this, this pink goo and the many,
as you can see in that biscotti cake is
[SPEAKER_04]: stacked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those the ones you're most excited to
process?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start with those because I'm,
we're going to have to trim these down,
[SPEAKER_07]: get the buds off, break the buds down,
do the sifting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and we'll kind of break it down into,
into components.
[SPEAKER_07]: We may get to all of them, but we'll
definitely do the top two to three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those first ones that I, I did trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just, this was the first bounce that
fell on the knee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this can actually be cleaned up
already, but that's first bounce sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be the first bounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, yeah, it was underneath the
screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, yeah, I was out actually looking
for a small 250 micron round screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's nice when we, when we go
through this process and they'll,
[SPEAKER_07]: we can do the redistribution naturally
through the 100, 110 lines per inch,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is about a 150 to 160 micron.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the very simple process that
most people know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You use your first screen, this 110,
uh, mesh or LPI, which is about 150 to 160
[SPEAKER_07]: microns.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the screen that the flower won't go
through, but most of the other stuff will
[SPEAKER_07]: the bottom screen, which is a 200 lines
per inch or mesh, which is 70 microns.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one we're going to catch the
good stuff on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one we're going to do this
nitrile glove trick on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before we start that, I wanted to talk
a little bit about the 60 and the 90.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an old process from California,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm not exactly sure who told the dry
sift wizard the process, but I heard it
[SPEAKER_07]: was a guy in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so the dry sift wizard shared this
technique with me quite some time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see a piece sticking out right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just sticking straight out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's interesting because this
process are very large screen holes,
[SPEAKER_07]: very different from this, um, 160 micron
to 70 micron.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually a 250 micron on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see through these and,
or sorry on the bod on the top and then on
[SPEAKER_07]: the bottom, you have a two 50.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually should be reversed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be the two 50 on top and the one
80 on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe that's how I have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: 90 is one's not marked in the 90.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 60 is the two 50 and it's on the
bottom and the one 80 is on the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to reverse these this
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't done for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I don't want to get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what happens is everything falls
through the two 50 lands on the one 80
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess the heads go through and land
on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the one 80 screen, you see these
little, like, it looks like little trees
[SPEAKER_07]: that are planted in the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a neat process.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to do it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, but I can explain it to you very
simply.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to take some nice dry
material, toss it across the top screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have this screen flipped the other
way, but we don't have the risers right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That way when it's like this, it protects
the flower on the inside and it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: going to kind of end up all around your,
wherever you're working your workspace is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this process is a very quick first
bounce process where you just throw some
[SPEAKER_07]: material on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't manipulate it or work it hard in
any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_07]: The heads are going to fall straight
through the contaminant and it falls
[SPEAKER_07]: through like this and it gets stuck in the
holes of the big screen on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you end up with these, it looks like a
little area of trees, miniature trees or
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very cool process.
[SPEAKER_07]: These screens are available at
freshheadies.com and bubblebag.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really the ones we're going to be
using today are the one 10 and the 200.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we mentioned earlier how it,
you know, the history leading up to
[SPEAKER_07]: Stephen sharing this process, as well as a
couple of other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I could remember their names.
[SPEAKER_07]: That we're sharing it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to you guys as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a very simple process where
you're doing the static process that we
[SPEAKER_07]: learned with the DVD and the parchment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except what we learn is that the particles
will all become charged in the static
[SPEAKER_07]: buildup of, I guess, us touching the
screen and doing circular motions or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you need more than just that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You also need the pressure of your hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show you guys the whole
process here in a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start breaking up some of these
flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Break them up, however Johnny likes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll lift up this top screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just crushing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll crush them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Crush them all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no like, boom, let's crush it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever we have underneath, we can do the
process for and see what kind of piles we
[SPEAKER_07]: can end up with.
[SPEAKER_07]: See what kind of a melt factor we can end
up with.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm mostly interested in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not about first bounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fresh plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like we said, we're going to eliminate
the first bounce and just completely crush
[SPEAKER_04]: it this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like chucking these plants on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got two plants in there,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just want to do one cultivar at a
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we do have these scissors that you can
get from your basic kids drawer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's where we pulled those out
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this here, as you can see, this is the
biscotti cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all the biscotti cake?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the biscotti cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's definitely got... It's got some
nice resin production there going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's best about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not how you should do this if
you're going to be saving these buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're actually collecting all this
resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought the scissors was a great idea
until I did one cut like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that easier?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And always go towards, not behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go towards, it's just going to come
off very easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the resin just piled.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is properly cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is four month cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This came in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw the humidity levels on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pulling this apart and I can feel
how juicy it is in the middle there
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's just like...
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be a lot more resin on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I would suggest after we do this is
let this material dry out much more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can get... Because it's still
got some freshness to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful material.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to break heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want them to kind of fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a few here that were nice and
clean, but like the inside of that,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the best part about this is after
you put it on the screen like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: let it sit a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the temperature right now, it's nice
and cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll dry right out again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know when you get that weeding
from some joint and you go use the
[SPEAKER_04]: bathroom and you come back, it's a little
bit too dry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, right now, because it just came
apart, it's been freshly in these boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see this box under here for this
next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to open it up so we can get
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was packed with a really nice
dry humidity bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit in the box because the boxes
are closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more curing again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're actually sweating the weed out at
this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have these stalks, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is like a constant support system
of moisture for the flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what's been so nice about this
long cure is we can keep those stalks at
[SPEAKER_07]: that level.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if this was bone dry, this would
dump so hard and we would have all of this
[SPEAKER_07]: resin off in a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize quite how fresh it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to kind of play it by ear.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll leave it sit for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: See if we can't get it a little more
crispy because it's very like marshmallow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just after four months cured a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm just like I'm blown with how,
how the center of this is so perfect,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm blown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm really blown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm right in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just because I'm actually surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was just going to crush
really nicely over the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was nice and dry in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sitting around the 57% and then it
went throughout down to 40%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what we can do is just to protect it
from any kind of debris or put it out like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be back in a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just going to collect this herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: It dried out a substantial bit more,
but there is a ton of resin on this flower
[SPEAKER_07]: right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure John's getting out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The resin that is just sitting off of the
flower mixed in with the plant runner,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's also popcorn size nuggets that
are absolutely completely coated in resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think ideally we'll wait for this
material to get much drier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, then he can grind it up down into a
much finer powder, uh, and do this process
[SPEAKER_07]: because with this nitrile glove process,
you can be a lot more, um, rough with the
[SPEAKER_07]: material, knowing that you have a
methodology of cleaning it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, um, you know, much quicker than
that DVD case.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that actually, we've waited another 10
or so minutes and that actually kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: worked in our favor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Broke it down a little bit more and kind
of ground it gently on the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very gently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw this shit, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this resin off, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're going to do now is we're
going to take all the flower off of the
[SPEAKER_07]: screen, uh, get it into its bag because
this flower has a lot of a lot more resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, John was just saying, Oh,
I could roll this into joints and share it
[SPEAKER_07]: with friends, have giveaways and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would certainly be very decent
joints, even with what we removed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a ton of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you die for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone said here you want this to be
like, I'll take that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to grab the
bag?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just making sure any heads that are stuck
to the bottom of the screen there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's keep it protected until I'm
prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, that looks quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get a nitro glove on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope that this glove is all
operational on the good side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get right out of this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't like walk it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to wipe this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I do that is, is this is cold
metal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll actually, keep my hand on the cold
metal just to bring it down a degree or
[SPEAKER_07]: two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not the warm hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people won't be able to do this
process and some will.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've done a single screen dry sift
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're now going to, I actually,
I'd be remiss if I didn't show you with
[SPEAKER_07]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to lift that screen gently
for me, Johnny B I'll come over with this
[SPEAKER_07]: and give them the view of the diamonds
across the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see there's contaminant in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like little stems inside the
resin, but we're going to get rid of all
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks really good, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cool that glove a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooling down the glove.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll get you to pick this up and
just maybe put it over to the side there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold hand on the, on the nitrile glove and
literally just doing like circular motions
[SPEAKER_07]: to pick up as much of this resin as
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's tiny little bits of contaminant,
which I just saw move.
[SPEAKER_07]: The resin doesn't move, but the little
bits of contaminant move in the,
[SPEAKER_07]: in the minor wind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the minor wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm watching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like staring at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm going to give it a go.
See heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see the difference in how it looks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you stay where you belong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all heads now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see it just like all going over
here, which is like clumping a little bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was probably because of the heat
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can collect those as its own grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I used to do something with just
change the glove on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe at some point I would change it
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when we see that, when we do with
the, with the, with parfey go a little
[SPEAKER_04]: long, we start doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we'll be able to do too much
more because of these clumps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be good if we had a clean card.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm really happy with the amount
of resin from that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that quick clean that I would
normally spend at least 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: half an hour doing only took about a
second.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only took a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really did only take a second,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of nice here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These jars actually came from Mauricio.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's kind of here with this right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to throw some of this in
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I pulled them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that in there and out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got like right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey, let's get that out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you saw that face, like I would,
I just, it is like, like the best first
[SPEAKER_03]: bounce of the world right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny beef with the fresh first.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a couple of batches for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the seconds and this is the first.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's best about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: We just talked about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the thing with heads and you can
just clean them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like never feel that, Oh, I spilled them
and they're all dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, get them back onto your screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do the process again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what's going to be important is
the type of glove too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I like the black.
[SPEAKER_07]: These gloves that I have are terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the glow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want nitrile not spelled with a Y.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I like the black ones and I
use them at my, um, at my facility and
[SPEAKER_07]: they really work great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, it's, I've never used it myself,
but I know that the black one,
[SPEAKER_07]: we can try it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you mark your resins and put
them away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, yeah, we'll get to, uh,
the next bounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you cutting up there, Johnny B
some pink.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some pink goo, some pink goo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll come check it out with you
real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how nice this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get rid of some of these
bigger families on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd you get this cultivar from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this actually came from, um,
I'm going to say the Fraser Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little Fraser Valley dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where all the fire comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking for that gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know where it finds.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll be back when all this is
broken up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, John's just doing the final touches
on this pink goo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you'll notice that he doesn't
have gloves on because this is his
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine and he loves to get his hands
dirty.
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves to smell the herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves to feel the resin and taste the
resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel the, you can actually see the
difference from the form of cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're saying with the raisins there,
they're just so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see what that last up to the bees
are coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing this at champs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny's just picking up the last.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the video.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny's just picking up the last of the,
uh, the flower here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to lift up and we're
going to show you what is on top of the
[SPEAKER_08]: two hundred.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay guys, there was some noise that ended
up happening, which is funny because when
[SPEAKER_07]: we first went to start the video,
there was like three digger machines
[SPEAKER_07]: banging and moving rocks, but it somehow
miraculously stopped when we started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it seems like someone's leaf blowing
and then the wind and then the wind is
[SPEAKER_07]: also like absolutely bonkers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we came inside to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been holding onto the ice pack here,
getting my hand nice and cold,
[SPEAKER_07]: getting prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cold is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can remove this top screen if you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what I was going to do is put the
camera down on the actual screen instead
[SPEAKER_07]: of on us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll do that right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little closer and then straight down
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks proper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try the different love
this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The green nighttime glove feels good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels better than the other glove.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: That glove had a lot of ridges in it that
the resin was getting stuck in.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one I can tell already does nice and
tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a really nice tight glove.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's important guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just cooling my hand with the glove
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see how this goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not moist at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can feel it doing the thing that I don't
want it to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Balling.
[SPEAKER_08]: But look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Balling.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can get those little balls picked up
and removed, that would be amazing because
[SPEAKER_08]: it's definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what you do is as a colder
room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do it in your colder room.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really high quality resin too.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just trying to get the message out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do a bunch more of these
videos.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see how I'm doing this,
you do a light carding over as he's doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that and you can actually pull those heads
out as you can see what I was doing here.
So.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually why I use the 250 is
because if it was way past, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: even being able to do what you're trying
to do, we could collect all of this resin,
[SPEAKER_07]: pour it through the 250, gently,
you know, like flour, mill it back onto
[SPEAKER_07]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, be, be in great shape that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the color on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I guess it's going to be kind of
more of the heat in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll make sure we go as cold as
possible as again, any, any little bits
[SPEAKER_07]: you see that around that you can just even
pick up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, check this stuff out guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have this here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some glasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some glasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably can't see it because right
now it's right on the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get this going again,
really quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: That first one dumped just amazingly,
but mine, it is like minus one outside of
[SPEAKER_04]: two, actually about three degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look into like a light rub.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm rubbing pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pushing contamination through the
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way I was kind of curious on like,
wow, like see that like I'm, I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: actually going to take a picture of your
hand at the same time because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I want to get it off my,
yeah, it's already gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that took me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Warm hand warming up, melting your resin
to my hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that actually makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it off the hand quickly and using the
cold pack, which is really key important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing that actually with that second
round.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for people who don't have a cold
room or don't have access.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's, it's another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're doing it in the warm,
but it's still, you can see the process is
[SPEAKER_07]: still working.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's totally working.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's melting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be more efficient if I didn't
have these little balls that are popping
[SPEAKER_07]: up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They really keep the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what they're going to do at this
point is they're kind of balling up the
[SPEAKER_04]: rest of the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just start collecting like snowballs
and we're just going to melt like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was getting a nice little, you can make
potatoes in a little hash balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really a nice pile though, like the color
of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see underneath this,
I've been always pushing through
[SPEAKER_04]: underneath on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: On that underneath there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So should I try to give it one more shot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course we'll do it one more shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be able to pick up some of this
and then you can just card these balls up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be like the seconds here.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, of course, like a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably even do a third on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost like believe if you close your
hand off one last time then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't want to lose any.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you won't because everything that's
here, you're still going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be surprised at how good it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I already know.
[SPEAKER_07]: This stuff on the top of the screen is not
by any means stuff that you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: throw away.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The magic is on the 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The magic is on the 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real magic is on the glove.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the real magic is on the glove.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just put that in there for me,
sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I surely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fill that one up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really nice resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, everybody said this is some of
the nicest resin I've ever grown,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the, that, that goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this could even by looking at
the whiteness, this could be the many of
[SPEAKER_04]: those last two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, because they're so close
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally I would get, I would get a jar
like this off of my whole room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mind you, I wouldn't be crushing at how
this is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we'll also just do this and you'll
be surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still some great sift here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really the real proper way to do it is
to run it through the 160 again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had my 250 screen because it
comes in really handy for that little work
[SPEAKER_07]: like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've misplaced it, but what I would do is
I would take all of this and I would put
[SPEAKER_07]: it on that 250 and all the resin would
fall through and all the little balls
[SPEAKER_07]: would stay on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'd be able to do that again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'd do another great one for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you could do one more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly, but after like, you have to make
it really even.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that worked out really good actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's the separation that worked out
really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always do that when you're doing
the sift and I used to learn that from
[SPEAKER_04]: doing a lot of sifting because of course,
you know, the DVD, you get these balls on
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to change the DVD over all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was getting this one doing the DVDing
all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouldn't get these balls on here,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a warmth issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a warmth issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent being inside the room
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a thousand percent what you said
Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a warmth issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: A thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only issue is that this resin is so
damn good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's balling into, it already wants to
melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And often when you clean it and it doesn't
ball, the stuff that's left on the screen
[SPEAKER_07]: that doesn't go in the glove is still
killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can still be totally melty.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see now on top of that 110 screen all
those balls and we did that one with
[SPEAKER_04]: Scotty case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like a bunch of balls on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's balling up like, look at how
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at this point it's hot in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for the final there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't even feel this on the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point here, I would stop sifting
if I was in my room and wait to come back
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'd cool it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I could feel that just using the
card at this point now.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the glove to the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the glove to the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the leaf to the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going too deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shitty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to get yourself good brushes because
you don't want these little.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, those brushes were thanks to your
wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but these are not ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not for this quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: This quality resin deserves a much nicer
brush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like using the horsehair brushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you actually got in the
beginning there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I used Badger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Badger, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, let's talk about the different ones
that you want to use so it's good to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my wife just bought me a shaving kit
years ago and it wasn't like I went out
[SPEAKER_07]: and looked for Badger.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a picture of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, let's take a picture of that,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're definitely getting a pulse up of
this and seeing the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the difference with the glove
tech and then how things are cleaned with
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, of course, is the normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why don't we.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that looks really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, in a sense, clear, not as good as
I would know as clear as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so now what I want to do real quick is
for us to sit down and have a bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Johnny, we did forget to show what
was getting pushed through the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is all, you know, I would call
it contaminant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely not pure heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more than likely, you know,
pistilid hairs, sorry, cystilid hairs,
[SPEAKER_07]: capitate stalks, sessile stalks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try and get photographs of
this stuff with the macro lens so you can
[SPEAKER_07]: see the different grades.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was like ended up on the screen as
sort of balled up hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the guys that, you know,
this stuff right here, which we almost owe
[SPEAKER_07]: it to ourselves to just show a little bit
of it in the sun here because it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was better than just really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really nice, really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll collect all of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of these heads will go to waste,
but I do think it's time to see just how
[SPEAKER_07]: well these can melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing the double screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Double screen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Double screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you hitting?
[SPEAKER_07]: Big chart?
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the big one there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: They definitely have like very different
color sequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three different color sequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the difference on the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the one at the end that you did
on that last glove.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that difference in how that
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's actually a difference in how
you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this, of course, is at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all going to melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to like go home and take that
biscotti cake and just put it all on the
[SPEAKER_04]: brows and I'm just going to squish it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you get like an 80 to 90 plus percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fucking awesome, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like isn't that like what you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely what some people think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Waste?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Waste?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking for like something to scoop
out of.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little something was... Pass me one of
your business cards.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scoopy Dukes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give yourself a little scooper.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to make a little video for you
guys so you can see it up closer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just go ghetto styles with the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the last time we did this in 2012,
we lost so hard we spoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's what I'm going to ask you to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not light it with this hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I covered the entire bowl, but light it
with this hand and come up from that way
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we will get this whole thing on
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it appropriate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it needs to be a lot bigger.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to dab one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: My hands just like stuck together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that was like on... I'm going to dab
it straight up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look what fell through though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm going to dab mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that is too good for screened
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is too good for screened.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I double screened it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I was like to get to the
next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes you make it so fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time when you do the nitro glove.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like... I feel like... I'm quite
excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: As he's doing like he did for me,
I'm doing the same for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it in with this and then I'll
kind of get out of the way right away so
[SPEAKER_07]: you can get the footage.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the footage is... You can see the
heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to say we need a bigger dab
tool, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be perfect for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hit this around 650 because
it is sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a quick dunk in the ISO here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely left some residue on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: More so than a normal... Well,
that's the thing about sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to say no matter what,
I'm always getting more residue from sift
[SPEAKER_04]: with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...
[SPEAKER_04]: It cleaned real nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now I had to go in a little bit
deeper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, let me video that as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I just dabbed that dry sift in a
turp slurper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't... My hands are so sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't like, later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got you Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was harder to light than I can
possibly tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, my fingers are stuck in my bum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it smells like Amsterdam puffin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice head space on the resin hits.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you might say like, wow,
you took a lot of flour and turned it into
[SPEAKER_07]: a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: of resin, but John does this all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took my flour and got twice as much
resin than I normally do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have a lot more left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot more left.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is exactly what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is exactly what I'm needing at this
present time in my life so I can get me
[SPEAKER_04]: through probably until September,
until I get my next crop, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's understandable to my medicine to
be able to have this separation,
[SPEAKER_04]: have this on hand when I truly need it is
the best part for me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, I appreciate you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really needed to actually sit down and
go over this and this is convenient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super bait actually feeling pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to wrap this video up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you'll see many more of these
videos to come.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, thanks, Johnny B for coming by
with your beautiful resins and we did a
[SPEAKER_07]: nice isolation on them and now you can
take take it all back home with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, or like you said,
I hope it lasts well into September for
[SPEAKER_07]: you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's one thing to want to get
baked and feel kind of like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel less stressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's another thing to lower the
threshold of pain of chronic pain to a
[SPEAKER_07]: point where life is doable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It brings it to that extra you can
obviously enjoy the beautiful skies,
[SPEAKER_04]: relax, read a book.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's what works for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save those terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's all about for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're not going to let any of this
go to waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be doing a clean up right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, everyone, for tuning in and
watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: And see you again really soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't smoke the cocaine.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_10]: yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
