[SPEAKER_01]: We're good to go, boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I want to thank
everyone for coming today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Marcus Bubbleman Richardson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my partner, Tony Verzura
from United Cannabis and Blue River
[SPEAKER_01]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we're going to talk to you
guys a little bit today about the
[SPEAKER_01]: glandular trichome, a little bit of the
science of the glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping, as I didn't bring a
presentation, that you guys know what a
[SPEAKER_01]: glandular trichome looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, pull out your phone,
go onto my Instagram account, bcbubbleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a ton of them on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take extremely close-up macro
photographs of these glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in essence, they are the essential
oils secreting glands of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: secrete all of the phytocannabinoids,
as well as the terpene and terpenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: profile that we, of course, know and love,
all the smells and the tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess I'll give you a little bit
of a history of how Tony and I came
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We share a similar vision in quality and
in standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing the bubble bags for the
last 17 years, teaching people how to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract their resin glands using water and
ice to a 99% glandular trichome head
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ratio you want to acquire your
medicine as it is the medicine of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me all the time, why don't you
smoke the actual plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, well, the actual plant is like
a carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it carries fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It carries cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It carries essential oil secreting glands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces seed oil that is extremely
rich in essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it produces all these things generally
from the one, from the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to make paper, we take the
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to make fiber, we take
clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to use medicine, of course,
we take the glandular trichome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was really in my passion for
following the glandular trichome head,
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching people how to isolate it,
that I met Tony, who's doing very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: things to me, but in a very different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony was responsible for founding River
Rock in Colorado with his partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's no longer a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he created some really incredible
things during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Act Now program, which is the
activated cannabinoid therapy program that
[SPEAKER_01]: he does with his pranoline, teaching
people to microdose cannabinoids suspended
[SPEAKER_01]: in terpenes in extremely small milligram
doses and really teaching people how to
[SPEAKER_01]: saturate the endocannabinoid system rather
than guessing with an actual visual map or
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape that is created by empirical
data, people feeding the data about their
[SPEAKER_01]: sickness, about the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information going back and forth into this
program created this digital landscape for
[SPEAKER_01]: specific cannabinoid potencies and levels,
activated and non-activated, to create
[SPEAKER_01]: what he's created, which is the prana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very much an attraction for Tony
and I to come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things Tony started doing in
the last year, which really was a path
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been on for several years,
but really sort of exploded in the Hash
[SPEAKER_01]: Church forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if any of you watch Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to see your hands if you're a
Hash Church fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Church is a live YouTube show that we
stream weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get 1,000 live viewers watching,
maybe 15,000 to 20,000 in the first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a forum of radical
openness where we share our ideas and we
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss things about cannabis in a way
that is very open and allows people to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn and be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an open source sort of a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really how Tony and I got
brought together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony also represents my brand,
the Bubble Man brand, down in California
[SPEAKER_01]: at Harborside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you want to give us a little
lowdown on how that's going down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say thank you for having
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I was here, I think it was
two years ago, much different type of
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other one was more of a business
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really glad to see the industry
progress as far as it has gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that everyone's still going
through the three tiers, LP dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and individuals, all having different
types of constitutional rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're finding your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's also a hard struggle when
you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started with this plant since 1996
and have been treated like a criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: since.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is I started when I was in a
couple of car accidents in 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prescribed the wonderful oxycodone to
me and I dropped about 150 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,
constantly constipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to use it in edibles and was
able to get myself off of opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since 96, I have no longer used
anything, not even a Tylenol for my
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also in, thank you, appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those out there using cannabis in
substitute of opiates, it's 100% possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit of an illusion that
goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't not subscribe to using cocktails
or pharmaceutical grade cocktails when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going through a surgery,
back surgery, a knee surgery, brain
[SPEAKER_00]: surgery, heart surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably don't want to smoke a joint
before you go to one of those surgeries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a place in the world for
pharmaceutical types of cocktails or drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can use in those small,
short window terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the long term use, it's something
that's going to break down our body and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately cause a lot of side effects and
a lot of other conditions and organ
[SPEAKER_00]: failures, all kinds of things that will
happen to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the long run, we have to search out
for something that's alternative,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's homeopathic, something
that we could turn to first, exhaust all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diets, foods, things that we put into
our body, anything that you feel in the
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oil-based world, I feel that we
as society should exhaust those first,
[SPEAKER_00]: try the natural path, and then explore the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're dealing with cancer,
you're dealing with life-threatening
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases and things like that and
ailments, obviously I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that says to use cannabis as an
alternative for cancer, but we have about
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 patients on our current program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a blended version of ratios that
are suspended in fatty acids and lipids
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the terpenes, with the plant
fats, with these cannabinoids in raw form,
[SPEAKER_00]: in active form, we're able to do them in
controlled dosages from a milligram to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams in three different delivery
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have plenty and plenty of patients
that are in remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put up a story before I came here
of a leukemia cancer patient that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any chance whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor said, look, we're experimenting
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids brought in our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: In three weeks, they released the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still in remission today from
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens quite a bit with cannabis,
and it's these bioessays and these
[SPEAKER_00]: observational datas that we can't ignore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for four years, I developed an EHR,
electronic health record software,
[SPEAKER_00]: a platform that's free to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supported through nurses and doctors
and scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those scientists actually was from
Calgary, discovered stem cells in 1988,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is one of our lead scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to do was provide
products that were 100% plant-based that
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized all of the terpene profiles,
these cannabinoid profiles, and delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a very pharmaceutical base,
but taking, as you say, the farm out of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical and putting the farm back
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, taking the harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceutical is spelled P-H-A-R-M.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take the harm out of pharmaceutical
and we spell the word F-A-R-M,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can put the farm back in
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both of our nations are going
through those growing pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 28 experiments going on,
as I call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, California, Oregon, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the media and the news and the
politics, they are very crafty in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can finesse the different
messages that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the message is still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still dealing with prohibition,
and we're still being treated like
[SPEAKER_00]: criminals instead of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, I just want to
interrupt for a second, Tony, that it
[SPEAKER_01]: hijacks the actual medicinal component of
the plant when you don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are putting these laws
into play, they don't understand where the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual medicinal components of the plant
actually are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're looking at it much the way a
prohibition-based grower would have looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at it back in the day, which is,
how much can I get and how fast can I get
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these aren't really conducive thought
patterns to a medical program,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even really a preventative or,
in my opinion, even a good rec program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the vibe for us to be coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about standards,
my background's engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to break things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And systems, and I also like to relate
them to the end use, so as a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been growing since 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped growing six years ago because
all of my friends grow, and they grow very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I subscribe to sun-grown live soils,
tea brews, everything that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly make organic, because it kind of
defeats the purpose of using this product
[SPEAKER_00]: in a chemical format.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against hydrocarbons or CO2 or
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where Marcus and I,
our bond has really, really came together,
[SPEAKER_00]: was I was first a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered cannabis worked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then many years later, the United
States said, hey, I think we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for people to do this legally
in a medical platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I became obsessed with how do I make
enough medicine to help other people like
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came across photographs of these
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're obsessed with your
medicine, you want to see the details if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're an engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started seeing these pictures of
these trichome heads, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my god, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a grape, but it's blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't see them because they were so
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like these unbelievable
photographs that I could never do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it with your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it with your camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm into photography, so I'm like,
you know, exploring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day I got a 2,000-zoom
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cut a trichome head in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that trichome head actually had a
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like a whole bunch of
vessels inside it, like the human brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you guys came to hear a little
bit of science of the glandular trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that all of the cannabinoids
are biosynthesized inside the glandular
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome head, as well as the terpenes and
the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are six varieties of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go through them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the three most popular ones are the
bulbous, which are little round balls that
[SPEAKER_01]: lay on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're high in a different level of
cannabinoids than just THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they happen to be the glandular head
that is responsible for oil yields being
[SPEAKER_01]: so much higher than, say, water extraction
or dry-sifting mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is because these heads are
so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're attached to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't break the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't isolate the same way when using
mechanical separations or when using water
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, which obviously freezes the
wax membrane and breaks the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The density of the trichome is still
affected by gravity due to its density and
[SPEAKER_01]: its oil makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sinks while everything else floats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inside this glandular trichome head,
we have organelles, basically vac walls
[SPEAKER_01]: and plastids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two little chambers inside the
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they create phenols and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those phenols and terpenes,
one in the plastids, one in the vac walls,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all different types of organelles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They push up into the upper membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you would have seen when
you cut that trichome in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fibrous mat is where the phenols and
the terpenes are pushed up into the upper
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle of the glandular trichome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's through UVB light that the
cannabinoids are actually cooked into
[SPEAKER_01]: existence, first with CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes from CBG on through a
variety of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN is not produced by the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a biodegradable cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it goes down and it starts floating,
falling apart, and degrading, it turns
[SPEAKER_01]: into CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBN's not actually a cannabinoid that
you will see in a living plant by testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just thought I'd lay a little bit of
the science on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we could talk a little bit about
those terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about how those are
evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prohibition-based growing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow using metal highlights or
high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started and did three parts hydro
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a drip system, deep water culture
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After aero, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: After aero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, ultimately, at the end of the
day, it comes back to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everyone tries to find ways to get
away from the sun and away from soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always tell everyone that's like,
so you're raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You eat everything organic, farm to table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many of those things were actually
grown into soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those things are grown
indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: All your vegetables, all the things that
you're eating and that you're putting into
[SPEAKER_00]: your body, are you throwing them in your
closet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing your micronutrients under
just a shop light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because then wouldn't that limit
the ability for that fruit or those herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: or those vegetables to really mature into
what it's supposed to do, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's code for what we put into our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put these things into our body,
we either have an interference pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning fats, inflammations, sugars,
glucose, whites, breads, rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these different things that we put
into our body, we're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all process them differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we don't grow those herbs or
those vegetables or those nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: true value and we try to put them into our
body, we're cheating ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we all ate an orange together and we
peeled open the orange and we didn't smell
[SPEAKER_00]: anything and it didn't taste good,
it didn't taste like an orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: chances are it doesn't have limonene and
chances are there's no vitamin C in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're eating a 3D printed fucking orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know why we're doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: With carbohydrates and sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we're doing it is because we
were duped by prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought, okay, prohibition is bad,
but we're going to do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was we fell into this
mentality where we would see how much we
[SPEAKER_01]: could get and how fast we could get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we limited the cannabinoids and the
terpenes that were being produced in these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guarantee you when we get back to
land-raised cultivars and we start
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding the land-raised strains back into
our platform here, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that we haven't seen in
decades and we're going to see terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that we haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 140 plus terpenes in the cannabis
plant that can be produced, plus about
[SPEAKER_01]: another 40 that have never been
identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's close to 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most labs test for 12 to 24 terpenes and
that's because only about 12 of them
really have been identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to repeat over and over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can guarantee you that has so much
to do with the way we've grown cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor under this prohibition mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if you look at that, and I have
nothing against indoor growing operations
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of them that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to look at what's being grown,
leaf or resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great if you grow three pounds
of plant, but what was your resin content?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means... Hey, right away if someone
tells me they grew three pounds of plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're growing for plants because
anyone that was growing for resin would
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me they got two and a half ounces of
resin, not three pounds of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing for resin, the medicinal
compound on your plant, or are you growing
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay your mortgage and to pay your car
payments, which is... Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the situation we find ourselves in
right now with... I'm an activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from an activist standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fought for hemp to be legalized and
grown legally in my province in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our first hemp license in 1995 and
I've never stopped growing it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been deeply involved in this industry
and I think it's unfortunate to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: way the legal mechanisms and the illegal
mechanisms are unable to somehow meld
[SPEAKER_01]: together and work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Health Canada in the middle
convincing dispensaries to hate LPs and
[SPEAKER_01]: LPs to hate dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really, really, really need to stop
doing that because the only way to conquer
[SPEAKER_01]: a people is to divide them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do not need to be divided.
[SPEAKER_01]: LPs and dispensaries are doing the same
great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving access to patients and
that's something we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to kind of say that a
little outside of the science version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at... We've grown,
in my experience, I would say 500 pounds a
[SPEAKER_00]: month for the last... I don't know,
I did that for like six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 lights indoors, 20,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as it's evolving, I'm getting
more away from that and just focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: processing resin into products because
that's really where my passion is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really when I look at it and I pull
back and I say, okay, what's really the
[SPEAKER_00]: best form for this plant for growing the
medicine and the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sun-grown, greenhouse, all organic
with supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the future of cannabis,
whether you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because ultimately
when you find something that works,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we produce a medicine for people,
we have to get it insured, we have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it on such a massive level, and we have to
standardize it, and we need to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those things come together and
that's really what the key is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best price per pound for your
resin is going to be in a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse environment, however that may
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I subscribe to that is
because I'm looking at terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our booth was set up today with...
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 20... I've done over 51 different
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we had like 12 of them available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're down to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this was is capturing those
essential oils in the terpenes from those
[SPEAKER_00]: tricum heads and doing them from flowers
without any solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like if you took like a grape
and you had to figure out how to pop the
[SPEAKER_00]: grape and take the inside out without any
THC and you just wanted to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without leaving a footprint,
which is very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the intellectual property comes
into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should really sort of point out
the difference between the indoor-grown
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes versus those sun-grown greenhouse
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what I've just in my experience
is running a... Let's say you run terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions on flowers grown sun-grown,
terpene extractions grown indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: big wide range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I've grown in sun-grown
terpenes from ACDC, a Covello sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start pulling these profiles from the
outdoor strains, we see 10, 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 of the terpenes that are in the grid
pattern of the DNA, if you will,
that light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come by the booth and check these
out if you want to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them all printed for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 627.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see like 10, 12, 13,
11.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see wide spectrums, full spectrums
of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see eucalyptal, you'll see
limonene, you'll see linalal, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: pionene, you'll see different types of
pionenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each type of cultivar, each type of
strain leaves the DNA in these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can... We now have been testing
the flower, the flower rosin, the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look at full-mount, then we press
out the full-mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to look at the full-mount
and those terpene profiles, the rosin and
[SPEAKER_00]: those terpene profiles, and the terpenes
of the original flowers next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can compare...
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of track all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you discover that
when you're growing indoor, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at what your lights are, and you have
to look at what you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing in gavitas or
pappies, or you're growing under HPLC,
[SPEAKER_00]: or HPLC, high-pressure sodium,
if you're growing under these different
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums, these different spectrums are
gonna allow that plant to express
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A perfect example of this is, if you
understand lavender, the herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: where is the best lavender grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: People that don't even know about lavender
will often see it on the package,
[SPEAKER_01]: French lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a region in France where lavender
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: This incredible terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens to do with how high they are up
from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all altitude and the soil,
and it's all these variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very important thing to note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before Tony gets back to the terpenes,
I just want to explain to you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: in case some of you really are more of
a...
[SPEAKER_01]: Noob standpoint, like a newbie in all of
this, is that phytocannabinoids help
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate our endocannabinoid system,
which helps regulate our biological
[SPEAKER_01]: functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have CB1 and CB2 receptors in our brain
and peripheral organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the deficiency that our
endocannabinoid system may use,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can use a variety of these cannabinoids
in different ratios, which is... One more
[SPEAKER_01]: time to reiterate, and I don't own shares
in this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that I'm involved with United
Cannabis is we are partners in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, everything he does in
America is his own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not guessing about ratios and
seeing, oh, try this, try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are creating a digital landscape with
the Act Now program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much more accurate because it's based
on actual evidence from people that suffer
[SPEAKER_01]: from the same sickness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to let people know a
little bit about that and realize why are
[SPEAKER_01]: we extracting these terpenes, because
about 12 years ago, one of my mentors,
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunkman Sam, he acquired some pure
cannabinoids, CBG, CBD, CBN, and pure
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-A from a laboratory in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went over to his place and he was
like, hey, you know, you got to try this
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit this pure THC-A in a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hit it and it was very
one-dimensional, very heavy set,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy in my eyes, not really what I would
call an enjoyable social experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he said, hey, I also have these
pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not derived from cannabis,
but they are pure analytical terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's D-limonene, and there's
terpenaline, and there's pionene.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had four or five different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, why don't you now try that
THC-A, but take one drop of this terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this revelatory experience occurred
that we realized that the modulating
[SPEAKER_01]: effects from cannabis come more from the
terpene profiles than the actual ratios of
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while everyone's trying to sell you CBD
and CBD, and different ratios of CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, we were more focused on what directs
those compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I understand those compounds are
the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the terpenes are your steering wheel,
and they direct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can induce an appetite or a
different medicinal component out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that otherwise didn't give you that
by modulating it with terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is some next-level shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I could tie that together to what
he was talking about, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people probably don't know what ACNOW is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, how we're breaking down these
terpenes was first looking at them in full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum in their cultivars, comparing
them and how they're being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw a lot of differences
between sun-grown, sun-assisted versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, indoor one-dimensional type of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of seeing 10 and 12 terpene
profiles, you might say three or four,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you might see five only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be concentrated on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really unexplored
territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it's led us to is saying,
OK, from what we know, which has also
[SPEAKER_00]: changed in the last three years,
most people look at cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis indica, and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the vernacular of that isn't really
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's afghanica and indica drug-type
varieties, and cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been something that's been
changed as of the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Clark and different individuals
have expressed their input on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because drug
cultivars, meaning things that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: resinous trichomes, is what we're talking
about that carries the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp varieties lack the sophistication
of these terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a part of their survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're producing male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cross-pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their intentions are not driven in the
same secretions in the oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they definitely don't have the full
profiles of those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that also lack of sophistication,
in my opinion, in what I've seen so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data is lacking in indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor does a great job raising THC
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see spikes of different types of
cannabinoids, CBG, THCV, and spikes of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these types of cannabinoids
are being produced on these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the terpenes that are involved in them
have to do with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the breeders that are out there and
good breeders that know what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, they're going to be breeding for
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be breeding for
resinous profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happened is our world has gone
from smoking to concentrates or extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: that then go into medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people that are making the
extracts are going to tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when somebody says, hey,
I grew this sour diesel outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you run it, and you get an 8% yield on
flowers, you go, oh, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, what do you mean what
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a drought at week five to
week seven?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did something happen with your phosphorus
cut out towards the end, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you overfed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you had this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start breaking down what happened to
their crop from the footprint of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or from the footprint of the resin that we
extracted in bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those yields tell me what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you collect that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, you need to know how to
translate the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for what you call newbies and
patients that are trying to find their
[SPEAKER_00]: way, hunting down strains and now hunting
down terpene profiles complicates the
[SPEAKER_00]: process even more when you're looking for
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my engineer brain decided to say,
OK, let's create categories, five simple
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, which is P1, 2, 3,
4, and 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those categories, we categorize
them really simply put.
[SPEAKER_00]: P1 is going to be all of your,
what everyone knows is cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be your Jaxx and your
Durbin poisons, your sour Ds, things with
[SPEAKER_00]: high limonene, things with high
terpenaline, beta carofaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The names are going to be the categories
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, patients need to know,
and it was Chimera who mentioned this on
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Church, that the constituents of the
plant, what make up the plant or the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be what the name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a patient, you want to know what
terpenes you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know the ratio of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you call it Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what terpenes and what
cannabinoids are in the end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's definitely going to be the
future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names will always be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the true name, in my opinion,
is going to be the constituents that make
[SPEAKER_01]: up what you're using medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are cannabis drive terpenes
important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we know there's 140 something of
these terpenes, and we know there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra 30 out there that are unknown,
and lavender is one dimensional,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that flower produces, it produces one
type of terpene really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis being one of those first
plants on earth that things evolved from
[SPEAKER_00]: different species like hops and things
like that, they have vast complex terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is undiscovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chosen by us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our noses that chose those terpenes
over thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this old factory that smelled the
ones we liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the plant looking a certain way
that made us like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you, if you go back 1,000
years, it was our noses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those terpene profiles act as
insect repellents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those terpenes act as nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those terpene profiles have
different profound effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can act as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can act as solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's important is to know where they
belong as far as classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beta carofaline we know turns on CB2
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important because that's
really the gas for that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we know we're putting 10
milligrams of CBD or 10 milligrams of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're modulating with a particular
profile that has high beta carofaline,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we know we're going to press that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what is it carrying with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it have mercy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have pining?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much cannabinoids does it
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go a step further and we say,
OK, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying I can eat terpenes and I
can eat this bud and that's going to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: my problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to turn on, especially if
you have that beta carofaline,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to turn on that CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about these receptors,
some of the receptors are on our brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: in our central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them in our peripheral organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a liver cancer and you're
turning on your CB2 receptor, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the CB1 receptors that might not be the
ideal way for you to go about saturating
[SPEAKER_01]: your endocannabinoid system because the
CB2 receptors are the ones you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need to engage to get those cannabinoids
to communicate with those cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce apoptosis, to kill the
mitochondria of those cancerous cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christina Sanchez from the University of
Madrid, if you want to write that name
[SPEAKER_01]: down, she's done some absolutely
incredible work in regards to apoptosis
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's individuals on this planet that
have inspired myself and like Marcus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got Sanchez, you've got Dr. Marzo,
that's International Cannabinoid Research
[SPEAKER_00]: out of Italy, Mishula, all of these people
have been identifying these receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we know is we've got like four of
them on the board, but there's thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cannabis, we've got this large
spectrum of terpenes that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: pinged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to know what they do and
how they act.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what they do in foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin A is a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what that does to our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're discovering these things in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important in the beginning is
put them into grids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Marcus is talking about,
this evolved into what I call advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to look it up,
it's actnowprogram.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a free service for patients in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since they didn't do any insurance,
I just said fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to use that kind of language,
but at some point you get over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's a fuck it, it's a fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at some point you have to say,
how do we help people and how do we follow
[SPEAKER_00]: up with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created a program that's HIPAA
compliant EHR software that has nurses
[SPEAKER_00]: running it, that tracks patients' results,
and you get free consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we teach you how to use these
different categories, P1 through P5,
[SPEAKER_00]: with different type of ratios,
with different types of full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and resin derived products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're infused, not extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Active and nonactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In raw form and in active form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people would be like,
why would you give me the raw form of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC-A and CBDA together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most doctors and scientists,
they think that it has to be activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our edibles, RSO, all of these types of
oils that we're putting into our body in
[SPEAKER_00]: its activated form is what they're
thinking is actually pinging the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when you eat an edible,
a 10 milligram edible, it's a long chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that works is it gets broken
down in your small intestine, large,
[SPEAKER_00]: and goes through the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're eating it, or if we're
eating raw THC oil, or we're eating
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, we have about a 95% loss in
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 5% bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm eating a 10 milligram edible,
it feels like 0.5 milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on our website that we put on
there, we have not only the services and
[SPEAKER_00]: the programs on there, we have links to
scholarly articles and publications
[SPEAKER_00]: because many patients are always looking
for proof and evidence in pancreatic
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, breast cancer, ID1 gene,
proliferation of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put all of the reports that I could
find out there, the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: how terpenes work with those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only thing I wanted to add
is Tony's saying a lot of stuff that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of you may understand and some may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he says activated, we're merely
talking about removing a carboxylic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: ring from the THC-A molecule or the CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: All cannabinoids come in acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are THC-A, CBDA, CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a carboxylic acid ring that can be
removed with a certain amount of heat
[SPEAKER_01]: applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what he means by activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-A is obviously non-activated,
but there's still medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC minus the carboxylic acid ring is
activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to feel the effects when
you eat it, when you put it on your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke a joint, as soon as you
light the lighter, you're activating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire activates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people didn't understand that
Courtney was the guy that does the
[SPEAKER_00]: juicing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, William Courtney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. William Courtney.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an inspiration for me a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at someone juicing leaves and
juicing THC buds to get the THC-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: William Courtney, just to tell you a quick
little bit before Tony gets into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: is he had a three-and-a-half-month-old
baby patient who was suffering with a
[SPEAKER_01]: brain tumor the size of a small potato in
her head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was splitting the left and right
hemispheres of her brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chemotherapy was for sure going to
kill her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started juicing cannabis and
giving her cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a couple of months, two or three
months, and they shrunk the tumor so far
[SPEAKER_01]: out of existence that they decided that an
MRI would be unnecessary radiation for
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's in remission and has no tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MRI itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say, the reason we don't
hear doctors saying this is because every
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor will tell you, I cannot say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will lose their license if they say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is,
we as a people cannot ignore this
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tony and I won't lose shit if we tell
you that it can shrink tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I said, OK, well, everyone's a
little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patient story that we did,
this guy was in a VA hospital,
[SPEAKER_00]: military, completely against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: His kids snuck in, non-active,
50 milligram, 3 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a leukemia patient?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This recent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And activated 1 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And snuck that into the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three weeks later, I was explaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went into remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really want to film the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I waited from November until last week
to film it, just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when somebody walks in extremely
ecstatic and happy, it's shocking for us
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to make sure that we have
the right information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has happened many, many times,
hundreds of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't ignore this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is you have to figure
out how do you create a use for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so infusing it and suspending it into
fatty acids and lipids allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability increase to 300% and 400%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilizing cannabis terpenes, whether
you're using them in your rosin or your
[SPEAKER_00]: hash or extracts in your smoke in them or
digesting them or using them in
[SPEAKER_00]: sublinguals increases bioavailability,
just like it does in oranges and every
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fruit, vegetable, and things that
we put into our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like the next wave in the
future of real medicine, especially here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is figuring out how to educate the public
first on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got breeders and you have
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wave of just breeding CBD
genetics, it's kind of like ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to breed CBD genetics,
drug cultivars, that express specific
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles of terpenes so that we can
maximize the bioavailability in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that we're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the government decides to restrict
you to 30 milligrams per capsule,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you say, man, if I was just eating a
30 milligram edible chocolate bar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost 95% of that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm eating a 30 milligram capsule
like what we're creating, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting an increase in that
bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually only use 10, 20 milligram
capsules and 50 milligram capsules as our
[SPEAKER_00]: max.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't eat the 50 milligram
active capsules because it feels like 350
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams and I don't do well with
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I was very keen on
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after talking to our scientists and
different doctors, when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: sublinguals and you say, okay,
I can give you 400 dosages in the power of
[SPEAKER_00]: your fingertips at one milligram dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at cannabinoid pharma kinetics
that's done overseas in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize that when somebody eats it or
somebody smokes it or they use a
[SPEAKER_00]: sublingual, you can see the
bioavailabilities, but you can also see
[SPEAKER_00]: how well it absorbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing into the glandular underneath
your tongue, doctors can subscribe to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, okay, I'm giving one
milligram dosing, I'm administering it as
[SPEAKER_00]: a sublingual, and I can work this way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new cannabis patient, instead of jumping
into a 500 milligram magical brownie
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna take them on to a trip for
two days and probably they'll never use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis again, we start with one
milligram with one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody says, I have pain,
and that's all you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have neuropathy or pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have trouble sleeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have IBS?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have tumors?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that tells us category one,
THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're brand new to cannabis and you're
sensitive, we go raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by suspending this into plant fat,
we're able to get the raw cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: into the body, just like with the juicing
that you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And building up a proper saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone needs a massive dose,
it's best to build up to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to give someone a gram of resin in one
shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're eating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something that happens in the
liver when we consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into our stomach and then it
metabolizes in our liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC in particular metabolizes into a
metabolite called 11-hydroxy metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is extremely powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone that thinks they've graduated
from Edibles because they've smoked a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, they quickly learned that they did
not graduate from Edibles once they ate
[SPEAKER_01]: that brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, wow, this is a real
serious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing that could be very
uncomfortable for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why it's one of the things I'm
really stoked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prana in the act now is that it's this
micro-dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One milligram drops under the tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how much that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most Edibles are 35 or 50 or 100
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are 250, some are 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen 1,000 milligram Edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will knock you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are not really what I would give to
grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's taxing on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are things that we're coming and
you're advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the possibilities are really
unlimited in the sense of how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: combine things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other studies out there
combining black tea with fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: lipids, cannabinoids, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That increases bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think about how superfoods,
or if you look at alkaline chart of foods
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say, OK, kale, Himalayan salt,
cayenne pepper, all of these things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are considered superfoods, are very high
on the alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things that are generally bad for us
are very low and acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're dealing with cancer and
things like that, we want to- Lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: theories say cancer can't survive in a
high alkaline diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the patients that we work with,
as well as myself, as I try to recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that, is say, OK, let's strengthen our
body and our mind and our health to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: good as it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at foods and it works the
same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at the future of that,
it's saying, OK, we've got this wide
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this organic resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got these categories and we're
putting them into suspended fats and
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next chapter to that is how
do we incorporate into the mainstream,
[SPEAKER_00]: into other medicinal foods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's really what cannabinoids
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're medicinal foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're actually essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand that essential amino
acids are the building blocks of
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids, the cannabinoids that we
produce endogenously in our body,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is why they're called essential amino
acids, because we need endocannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It regulates our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in turn, that system regulates both
our immune system and our central nervous
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts them into homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a very important thing for
people to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have much more time to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to end it on letting you
guys know to not be afraid to share this
[SPEAKER_01]: information with anyone that you know,
whether it's for a preventative aspect,
[SPEAKER_01]: a recreational, someone that's stressed
out and needs to relax, someone that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: it for medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid like doctors are to share
this information because it's the right
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing more important to a
terminal patient than hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can give hope to a terminal
patient, you've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sleep problems, that's our P4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in large dosages, we use CBD and CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that combination of CBD and CBN is
really good for inducing sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when THC is degraded into CBN,
that breaks down into a byproduct like
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ocular feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of you that are as old as I am
have ever smoked what was called regs or
[SPEAKER_00]: schwag, maybe the worst you ever had in
Canada was BC bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, we had Mexican
schwag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff made my eyes go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it put me into couch lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is THC converting into CBN in a long
term process on the plant after it's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke it, it's very like
sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you could do for yourself,
like if you weren't able to buy these
[SPEAKER_01]: products, is you could take a coconut oil,
you could crock pot it, you could take a
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy indica, something that people are
like, oh, this is really like heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could make a nice extract with it and
eat a tablespoon or less right before bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd sleep like an absolute baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't actually have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly for preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the consumption of cannabinoids orally
to me is one of the most important ways we
[SPEAKER_01]: can take them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have ocular pressure,
nothing's going to beat smoking one puff
[SPEAKER_01]: of a joint to reduce ocular pressure
instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can avoid blindness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would never say to the people that
say, we're never going to be, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to move away from the medical aspect with
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be people with MS,
Parkinson's, glaucoma that can relieve
[SPEAKER_01]: ocular pressure and relieve tremors
instantly after one or two puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a real quick tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those that smoke bongs, if you
collected your reclaim or you were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get Keef or you were able to get your
cooking hash, if you just threw it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: oven, 250 degrees, and you did it for a
long period of time, like nine days,
[SPEAKER_00]: long periods of time, you never hear me
say this on hash torch or anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can take your Keef and you can
convert it to CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've done full conversions of Keef
into CBN with like 250 to 270 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did it quickly, like when you were
trying to cook it on a pan, on the stove,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would go from being light, light brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would go to like a chocolate
coffee ground kind of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would get really dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that with a coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you went and got CBD,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get access to CBD,
then you could combine the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be really good for using
that for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can check us out at booth number
627, Bubble Man brand in Blue River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please check us out on Hash Church
live every Sunday at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: West Coast time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone.
