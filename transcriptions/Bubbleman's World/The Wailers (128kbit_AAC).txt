[SPEAKER_04]: We're back in the Tuk Tuk Amsterdam style.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing good today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We rocked the booth hard today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked a lot of people about the
endocannabinoid systems and trichome gland
[SPEAKER_04]: isolation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're gonna go see the whalers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, it's okay.

[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, you gotta dig this high times
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of good people come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always some good bands and some
unique friends you maybe haven't seen for
[SPEAKER_04]: a long time or some new friends you have
yet to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just gonna go check out the
whalers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably go backstage and chill with
those guys, pull out the fab egg and do
[SPEAKER_04]: some full melt hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned for more fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, see you soon.

get back to the Krasnopolsky and we pull
[SPEAKER_04]: out some of that moonshine haze bubble
hash from the rare dankness crew and the
[SPEAKER_04]: River Rock crew and just all of the good
people there that are making it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna show you a little bit of this
bike ride through the streets of Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we'll be back at the hotel and
we'll be taking hits off the D-nails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after all, we're only ordinary men.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, me, me, me, and you.
[SPEAKER_02]: God only knows it's not what me with you
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: For worthy crimes from the rear and the
front end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Died.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the general set and the lines on the
back.
