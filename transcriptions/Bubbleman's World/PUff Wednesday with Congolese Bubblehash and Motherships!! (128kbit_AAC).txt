produce melty resin the watermelon the
[SPEAKER_00]: astro boy and a lot of TGA strains are
definitely full melt certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be Yeah, it's definitely like a nine

[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned back in the days of old Well,
you know what staring up you have to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how these ovals are suspended in this
glass It's it's really it's taking some
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, and I will insert them into the
video amazing So while you're staring at
[SPEAKER_00]: those he didn't really be able to see what
was there and what the sun reflection
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been hitting bowls already off camera
before we started this You know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't actually hit that many you guys

[SPEAKER_00]: start this session I'm moving this guy a
little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep them on the Pad and what do we
got 90 and 73 or 120?
[SPEAKER_00]: 73 yeah 90 well, maybe we better start

[SPEAKER_00]: actually if this is a pipe that would suck
a lighter out for sure or a beeline the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of trouble that it has is
definitely Mother ship just constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking it out of the park this purple is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable Even the stacking of the
bubbles is so nice coming out of the disk

the Opals just at this angle when I pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: back every Opal in here went red I mean,
I leaned over a tiny little bit and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all green You know you move
another little angle and you see more
[SPEAKER_00]: blues, but like yeah right over here at
this angle from the Sun coming down red
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed at the level of perfection that
they've acquired from the distance of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that is encased around the Opal is
almost And 33 Opals 33 separate Opals
[SPEAKER_00]: encased all around the piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one here There's another
one right on the bottom below the disk I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even get to see that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had missed that one as well when I was
doing the photography.

are sitting with it growing legally Really
[SPEAKER_00]: great puffing killer.
