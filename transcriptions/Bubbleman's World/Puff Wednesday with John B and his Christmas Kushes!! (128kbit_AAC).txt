[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome to Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's John B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to be home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a great Puff Wednesday sorted
out for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm home, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be our first Puff
Wednesday since the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: John's been kind enough to bring his brand
new titanium sublimator over with his
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptable, and we're using my old style
bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might throw it into the Swiss perk a
little later on for some other hits,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's brought a lovely selection of
buds over, and he'll get to that in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all John's...
[SPEAKER_02]: Five different Christmas cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, five different Christmas cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the Christmas cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also got about 300 grams of
full-melt 90 and 73 micron bubble that's
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the five-year Master Kush cured
bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, some other nice little treats.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more in the five-year here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be dabbing it up through
the D-nail and through the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to test all John's nuggets,
and of course... Some fresh frozen and
[SPEAKER_02]: some dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll finish it off with the fresh frozen
that we did with the bubble bag lights and
[SPEAKER_02]: with some of John's 99% gland head dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where to start, John?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where to start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's break in the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really stoked to break in the
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been on for about a half an hour now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we make sure that the timer's still
good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start with number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we photographed all these nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little earlier, I'll be inserting them
into the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we pull out a nugget, as we pull out
a little... Oh yeah, this is... Geez,
[SPEAKER_02]: look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's reminiscent of almost cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this particular bud that he pulled
out because it's a little bit of a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: lower branch bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just completely coated in a
velvety, veloury, terpene-rich gland
[SPEAKER_02]: heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't... Oh, that's a real nice exotic
Kush smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which number is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, so... Number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, there's something in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you grind that up and let's
sublimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sublimator represented most
excellently this year at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enrico and Al really busted it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all over Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were at the greenhouse on the
Haarlemmerstraat as well as sometimes at
[SPEAKER_02]: the greenhouse off the Darmstraat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the sublimators going.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sharing it with anyone that was
willing to come and try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had kind of a funny experience,
didn't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids from... The two girls from Costa
Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we were being nice,
but we absolutely moonshined Haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: annihilated these two girls, and they
ended up going out and standing out by the
[SPEAKER_02]: canal for a good 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never came back in, so... That wasn't
our intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really look forward to doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were just being gentle,
but the sublimator is truly a beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporization unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just your everyday unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy to know that the
sublimator in the D-Nail, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: you see them side-by-side here,
they aren't really a comparable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The D-Nail is sort of a stand-alone,
used with any one of your bongs,
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 or 18, dabbing full melts or oil on top
of the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a unit that you're going
to be using for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my opinion, I love both of these
units equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one does what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, of course, is a completely
different unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sublimator is going to give us rips of
herb, of hash, and of oil, solventless
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, that we pull out of the downstem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the D-Nail is a completely
different unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really just great for the ease and not
having to light a bee line constantly,
[SPEAKER_02]: not having to find a lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The D-Nail is just constantly on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cleaning that out a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a little hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a nice hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been a while since we've had
our sublimators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine went on the fritz a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the older version.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, of course, the newer version that
comes with the tonic burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a 70 watt instead of a 50
watt, and it's titanium instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a much better unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see nice big smoky rips,
even from cannabis vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: My unit hasn't been used in a while,
so it's a little bit stuck right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can probably wipe that clean and make it
a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if I have wipe, but I will
find an ashtray for you to dump your used
[SPEAKER_01]: herb in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be filling that thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little rural ashtray from
Martin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice gift passed on over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely see the difference here
of the color one's burnt and one's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the difference brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still has the purpley fall colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hook me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down for a sublimator hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hit all five of John's
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hit all of these hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it through a variety of
ways, sublimating, de-nailing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're even going to hit the Swiss perk
with the B line just to show that we love
[SPEAKER_02]: all the varieties of smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Puff Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So am I loaded up there, John?
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first sublimator hit in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess since Amsterdam I hit it quite a
few times there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essence of the herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just perfect for the herb right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing to get vapor rips like this off a
pinch of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things while I'll
always go back to this sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with the plastic bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the food grade hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I'm not a huge fan of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still get the most incredible tasty
hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most incredible tasty hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you great medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for me, it really relaxes me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes that pressure here and just does
one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, while we're doing that,
we're producing sublimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That oil that just condenses in the down
stem right in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost at any given time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even used this unit in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can guarantee that there's oil in
there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tiny little bit of sublimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not to be confused with the
reclaim that you pull out of an oil rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pure herb and wet washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll dab it in the side hole for John
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little bit of itty bitty hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, that we just smoked,
number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my room right now, my number two would
have been my, I'm calling it Dennis
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, the Hopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hopper.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like the Dennis Hopper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very pretty nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, all of John's herbs is fall
colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got those really nice, cush,
purpley fall colors at the end of its life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some have more orange, some have more red.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally they all have this really
nice purpley color going through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be confused with that old school,
late 90s, east coast purple that no one
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, you know, that bubba,
that OG, those deep cushs that just flower
[SPEAKER_02]: out so pretty at the end of their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just don't take it to the
end of their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're not seeing these pretty
fall colors too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a fresh one there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just put mine in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you clean the screen or did you even
bother checking to see if there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: speck?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get you, let's get you packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go, sublimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's hard to describe the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You almost never taste this aspect of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only with this machine here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have to, you know, and I don't
own this machine and I don't own any,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't own any steaks in the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just say that it's the best hit
flavor-wise that I get and it allows me to
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy cannabis, which I normally don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually just strict, a hash guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about the sublimator is we're
just not smoking all the contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the second best thing about
the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best thing about the
sublimator is that it makes this
[SPEAKER_02]: solventless red oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost as though the solventless red
oil is the product that you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much the way the bubble bags, you know,
they're the messenger that really brings
[SPEAKER_02]: you the product, which is the bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the bubble, the bubble bags are
nothing really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we grind up another flavor
and get through these five flavors so we
[SPEAKER_02]: can get into some of these hashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to set one jar down here
and grab the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this, we have a number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pattern cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell, the look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they all are, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely what I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one phenol that I've kept that
I really, really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have such unique, unique
undertones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their strong Kush flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got some of them have the
OJ, some of them have the Baba,
[SPEAKER_02]: but within that, there's these undertones
of Kush's that are just very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great to get terpene gas
chromatograph tests done on the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: spikes and see exactly which terpenes are
and in what ratio they are to be making
[SPEAKER_02]: these really floral, spicy smells.
This is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more than a Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost got a lemon smell in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would be the Larry OJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Larry OJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Paki cross with the Larry OJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice strong Ruer ashtray crack,
crack, crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, certain ashtray, you might not want
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just touching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there's certain dishes,
certain glass floors, certain glass dishes
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would just never do that to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the Ruer ashtray, it's not one of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can absolutely do that and not have,
have really any worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to hit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, the Pakistan crossed with the
lemon Larry OJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you can't pull it the way you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you let the sublimator build up with
a little bit of oil, which we inevitably
[SPEAKER_02]: do, there's a learning curve to pulling
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw John kind of do these little
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't, it won't give you that snap
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will, if you keep your rig all clean
and maybe use a different bong and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this particular bong, it pulls out
real slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you have to do is put a little bit
of pressure on it and just let it pull out
[SPEAKER_02]: slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't do the quick lift, but it will
definitely do, it'll definitely come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to empty that out and load me up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you making the sound of licking
your lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can still taste the last flavor on my
lips, which is another thing I'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of give props to Enrico and his
sublimator for is the taste and the flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to hang around more in your mouth,
in your throat with the sublimator than
[SPEAKER_02]: any other way that I consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course this is just my opinion,
but I took my last hit several minutes ago
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can still taste it on my lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at the top of my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's deep tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That almost is reminiscent of the old
school champagne hash plant in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: that musky, just potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That flavor is just so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to describe actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to describe for how strong
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not stringent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Cush musk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if Cush was a horse,
that would be like it's piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Cush was a horse, this would be the
piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming up with new things always
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are hits that as you take them,
you know how high you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to get to the horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe how good that last work
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, we're hitting herb,
just little pitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, was that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we just keep repeating ourselves
and it can potentially be getting boring,
[SPEAKER_02]: but can't say enough about the taste on
the sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's getting a little burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that... My hits were perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got none of that burnt popcorn taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not to say I didn't get high off
the first one, but that second one got me
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, this jar is just wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Christmas cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three cheers for the Christmas cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how about the irony of me wearing a
pure hemp rolling paper company t-shirt?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hemp, so I love it, but I don't
actually use rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I did use rolling papers, I'm certain I
would probably use... I use a pure hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wearing a good bunch of guys too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wearing it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the sublimator, a couple of good
rips on the sublimator is reminiscent of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the first time you smoked like 50
volcano bags and got to that point where
[SPEAKER_02]: you were like, holy smokes, you can really
get high off vaporization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the concentrated version of
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what the sublimator is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's none of this lightweight airy hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like full on smoky, intense rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just hitting herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get through all these herbs,
we're going to hit these hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hashes are...
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to bring us to the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five flavors of herb, five flavors of
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to get to this one that I
pressed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some, once again, cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's this stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This powdery goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the shine from the plastic here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see all the thousands of millions
of little tiny balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's so cool about looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might do some dabs from this slab
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dab to the sublimator, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressed it out to this, so... We'll play
with that a little later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, I think we are moving on to...
What do we have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the last hit of number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have three big rips of number
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have gone one big hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's have a huge session of number
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say, I'm glad John gave me another
rip of this because the first two rips
[SPEAKER_02]: were...
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is way stronger than that first
one we did, that number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste how strong it is in the
content of the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That musky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was indica, indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say more indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel the sedation on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be more of... Well,
this is haus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a haze, bulge,
crossed with skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: The haze, bulge, skunk, skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: H-O-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said H-O-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you should call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is because that's exactly
what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you that last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Pakistani crossed with the lemon
Lario G is... It's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally loosened my body completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have broken about 16 bones in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little bit of arthritis in
certain spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It caused me pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit of a knife stuck to my nose there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke a strong strain like that,
how I notice it mostly right away is A,
[SPEAKER_02]: my collarbone won't be aching immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which usually goes into my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a photographer and stuff, it can cause
a little bit of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the case after all of these little
heads just falling over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bouncing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're melting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the giant dry sift screens right
behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what... And this is pretty fresh
herb, so luckily not a ton of heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that a 14 day hang?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can tell the humidity is not crack
bone dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that personally unless I'm
dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to vaporize it,
it's okay to have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sublimator... It hits so intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually see... Did we lose our 30
minutes?
[SPEAKER_02]: The sublimator might have gone off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just turned it back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we do a genail rip while we're
waiting for the sublimator head to...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hit this... We'll hit this stuff
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sublimator now has a timer built
into it so this way you don't leave it on
[SPEAKER_01]: all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because apparently that's why...
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing... I was plugging them in the
morning and I basically just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: hit them whenever I needed something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's kind of the ideal situation
and I got to admit the guys at D Nail,
[SPEAKER_02]: they set up their unit for that very
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the cannabis cup we had this thing
going for what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 to 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice to be able to walk... In a
cold environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nail was being constantly bombarded
with cold air so it was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we came home to the hotel and had
it on for another 4 to 6 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 16 hours a day we had this unit going
every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get home I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turn my D Nail on and I leave it on for
10 to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that the sublimator eventually gets
to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my one wish for the
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: A 30 minute timer for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be pushing that button
literally 30 times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The great thing about Enrico is he's
constantly improving his product.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not wanting to believe that it's
perfect and it's where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always trying to create a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's already working on something else
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got to give praise to Enrico for
his really... If anyone out there can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me of a...
[SPEAKER_02]: ...unit that gives a taste-irritant of
cannabis, please I'm willing to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still tasting the last one but you're
going to... I'm going to give it a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hitting the D Nail a lot and it
hits a little bit differently than a
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go real slow draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the temperature you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might keep my D Nail up a little
bit higher at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: 810 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it down at 400-500.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find the hit to be tasty but just too
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want just a terpene hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get that with any vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really want is the full hit like
what John just received there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still receiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was some of that pressed out
Kushbubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even want to stick to the...
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing though is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to clean it up to stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take myself a little dab of
that now myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because... It's not that we need huge dabs
but why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little trick there is just kind of up
the hole so that it turns into a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a nice little...
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like a carb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had one in Amsterdam and that was
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he was there we were able to carve
the nail perfectly and really hold it
[SPEAKER_02]: hidden.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he wasn't always around and when he
wasn't around of course he took his carb
[SPEAKER_02]: cap with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I definitely want to get in
the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are we continuing on Mr. Hopper?
[SPEAKER_01]: No actually we're on the Haas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh we're on the Haas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the Pakistan lemon Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're on the Haas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hayes OG skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to keep up sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be back and running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a nice consistent lift.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a little pad somewhere nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it a little clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we can't eliminate a little of that
stick that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a nice taste to it that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of your Christmas Kush's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long have you been doing the
Christmas Kush's for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back... It's been six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about Christmas Kush in 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of the Christmas Kush was
actually... The last one we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: try here is the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Christmas Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it all was generated from
and that was in 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely lovely cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well grown and... It's Haas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that very strong Kush-y funk as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes the Kush more than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very pretty with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, once again, it's got that
overtone of the musky, strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush-y flavor, but then something a little
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't taste the Haas per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even sure that I taste the
skunk, but it's something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be the secret ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The secret ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hit the horse yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Double up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doubling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doubling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doubling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Christmas Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tis the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, if you haven't already checked it
out, we at bubblebag.com and freshheadies
[SPEAKER_02]: .com are having a Christmas sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% off everything in the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even up to 30% off some of the
hemp hood and clothing.

[SPEAKER_02]: X-M-A-S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just punch that in to your

[SPEAKER_02]: card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shopping cart at freshheadies.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a nice little kick down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with me, with medtainer,
we have our Christmas specials on www
[SPEAKER_01]: .medtainercanada.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have our stoner stocking stuffer
kit, which is a TY medtainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get another one at 50% off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have our little Rasta
Christmas colors, red, green, and yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come in a little kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all comes with, actually they
come with some stickers from bubblebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some Rasta stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we throw a little package in there and
everything out when you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nice little thing from Medtainer
Canada for Christmas too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just sharing the love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've hossed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've hossed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, you're doubling up.
I did double up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not sure if you've doubled up to
the point of no return.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to double, double, double up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks better.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next on the list?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just hammering through these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really don't have hours a day to waste,
but we want to give a nice little video
[SPEAKER_02]: and show you some different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what started the Christmas
specials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Christmas Kush Medi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the Medi?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump in, grab one, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the 97 days?
[SPEAKER_01]: 97 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 day flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having some fun seeing what it can
actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really nice looking little
nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very dark and purple and quite certain
under the microscope, it would absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: look divine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is by far the taste of fresh
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The jankers that have actually ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure it's substantially darker
than this other pile here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how green that is compared to this
is just almost dark purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same room, side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just went next to 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's put it in the same bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's all nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the last here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be getting into doing some de-nailed
hits in a while after we hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimator, but for now, the sublimator
stands alone to be able to give rips like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to give it up to
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also stand with the best of them
for dabbing and even dropping bubble into
[SPEAKER_02]: the bowl because you can dab in the
sublimator, put little hits of bubble into
[SPEAKER_02]: the hole, but I always found the best hits
were when I dropped bubble on top of a
[SPEAKER_02]: screen inside this bowl and then put the
one down on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about the lack of direct contact
really created a nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the trick would have been to clean
the inside of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I have another one of these
little guys in my magic desk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I have in my magic desk?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have stickers from Scott from Rare
Dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even burned, it's a different color.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Karma Genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you in Amsterdam this
year, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we got to spend more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, great head banger, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to have a nice rip there,
eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to Karma Genetics and I have tried
everybody's, but I was definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: impressed with the head banger push that
he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I think that we were trying
that I said that came out of Prince George
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a little different and it was a
head bang or head bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know the exact name of it,
but I was able to place the name of it
[SPEAKER_01]: when I landed in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I think I got that a little
bit cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll just clean this real quick too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you this beautiful clip
right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a little hit of the Medi Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how we love the Medi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The back end of that, I would say it's
like a Fruit Nutist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see earlier, we might have seemed
like we were struggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have made the sublimator look a
little sketchier than it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you clean it properly, it comes out
the way it's supposed to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sits for two months and not use it
and then just jump on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it sat for three months actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four big rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still tasting good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Bajou.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass that on to you, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big smoky popcorn rip for John.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like popcorn, so I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say when you're not in burn mood
is when you're testing before is when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're actually getting the last of all
those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff might not be the tastiest hit,
but I guarantee it's one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would put some cash on that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's definitely quite nice,
but we're pretty much going to pack in the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we have one more left?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have one or two left.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three was a Roninling cross with
a... Lemonary OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me smell the jar, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unique again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to tell them a little bit about
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one had such a light green in certain
aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost though, I have three buds
right here and it looks as though it's
[SPEAKER_02]: three different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the orange hairs on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the underlining light leaves on
this one and then look at the purple
[SPEAKER_02]: calyxes on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had this out in the sun,
I thought it had powdery mildew on it at
[SPEAKER_02]: one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pulled this nugget out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it was the bottom of... Not
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it had powdery mildew from a
distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sun, no powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Total crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw a couple of pictures up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have three different colors too that
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're substantial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the one you just ground up
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Romulan... The Romulan cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite nice to be able to try these
flavors on something and get the true
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was something I was really looking
forward to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Darren wants to say something to
us on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to check with him real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going Darren?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry we had you on mute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making a video.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Darren's in our chat room right now which
you can go check out at tinychat.com
[SPEAKER_02]: You can punch that all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check out Tiny Chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're normally in there quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're usually in there talking about
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have different people from around the
world come in and discuss hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where they're at in their
section of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come check it out if you get a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to enjoy this hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm trying this one here,
it's right in the middle of the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like this and it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is... I'm going to clean
this one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little mixie.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a pleasure to have a nice little
cannabis vaporization session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually cannabis isn't intense enough for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most vaporizers don't do the trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always felt like if we could multiply
it by 50 or 100 times, a volcano bag or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Enrico came up with this design
and for whatever reason... Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives that most flavorful, intense yet
but... Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: With great power, you got to give it some
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we talk about some people
get sublimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a little too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: With experience, people that are dealing
with different types of pain control or
[SPEAKER_01]: just generally like ourselves have a
higher tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We too enjoy this thing daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wouldn't you say that the implications
are vast for the med user as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: the recreational user?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%, that's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recreational user is going to gain in the
oil that is produced as a free product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to save money on herb or
hash or oil, whatever they're using
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're going to generally use
less of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take the craftiest weed and this
is going to take that weed and make it
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's definitely like I don't
personally want to smoke crappy weed out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like smoking your great weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about... And it was just
saying that what you put in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has nothing to do with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have great resin, but even weed
that isn't so floorful or whatever like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, there's still the charcoal that's in
there and the sublimator is able to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually benefit with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the crappy weed, but the non-fragrant,
the stuff that isn't hung dry is being
[SPEAKER_01]: done with on screens and with
dehumidifiers, more commercial grade
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hot air extraction unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely is a hot air extraction
unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we managed to hit all five of your
jars?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the last number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just totally satiated with Kush right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking that we should probably do
maybe a D-nail hit each of some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: five-year cured master Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then while we're doing that,
let's turn the sublimator up to maximum so
[SPEAKER_02]: we can come back and we can hit the master
Kush off the sublimator and we can give
[SPEAKER_02]: our audience sort of an honest taste test
in the difference between the titanium
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimator and the titanium D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the five-year cure right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm turning this one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you turn that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have the time on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a master Kush 90 micron bubble
that I've had for about five years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about as long as we've had the 90
micron bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just absolutely incredible how
it's, I don't want to say degraded,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is a misnomer at best,
but it has, in a sense, degraded.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichome head, the way it's melted the
wax away, the way the resin is finally
[SPEAKER_02]: just mulched down into a putty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's produced this really unique texture
and I appreciate it for the fact that I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make this texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resin made the texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's just happened over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will offer you one first,
John.
[SPEAKER_02]: The master Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I can guarantee you that
John mentions right away, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting when you have something that's
been curing for five years, although it
[SPEAKER_02]: did spend a good two and a half years in a
refrigerator, is the taste of the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way you can say there's no
taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say that the terpenes have been
affected greatly, but I wouldn't say in a
[SPEAKER_02]: way that they've evaporated and
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say about the taste of that
master Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've heard it from John B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste is... It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strong taste, is it not?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through my whole mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just isn't like on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through my whole mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that mmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just everywhere, which is actually
quite...
[SPEAKER_01]: The high... Very sedated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely something I'm liking right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giving me that relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a hard day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were both talking earlier about how
with the cold weather, backs were starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to hurt and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is definitely more of a strain
that I can easily feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relaxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That full sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I coughed, I blew out the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was coughed about the taste of that
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very different from everything else
we've smoked, even that other hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we'll hit again as a reminder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very interested to hit this hash off
the sublimator to see if we can increase
[SPEAKER_02]: the intensity of that taste, or whether or
not it's going to be on par with the
[SPEAKER_02]: D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, the D-Nail, we can turn it
up to any temperature we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we do find the taste is tastier on
the sublimator, I say we turn the D-Nail
[SPEAKER_02]: down to see if we can't modulate those
effects of those tastes without
[SPEAKER_02]: dissipating the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to dissipate the hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if we turn this thing down to 400,
we can get a straight turf hit,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would be amazing, but it would be
this light blowout nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to get a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sedating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in my heaven right now, hitting all
these cushions and all the sedation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, for people that
aren't in chronic pain, or that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: just chronic recreational users of like,
cush or heavy narcotic-like strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: most people don't enjoy doing gauntlets
like the one we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure watching the beginning of
this video, to where I am now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, ah, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for the next rip and what
it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have that nice brick of lovely
powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's PK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was burning myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, don't be burning yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think because that flavor that's in
our mouth right now, why don't we try that
[SPEAKER_01]: on the sublimator next?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to clean my palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to clean my palate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should clean this out a little
bit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how many of you guys own a
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things you end up having to do
is blow out a little bit of the carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: residue off the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally like to close my eyes when
doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of blowing red hot carbon into my
eye is frightening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just something to keep in mind
when you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warn your friends as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blow this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're saying is while doing that,
you should always warn your friend or
[SPEAKER_01]: calling or people around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're touching any kind of an
apparatus that is 12 degrees plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you have like three seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the ease of the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the lightweight cable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fits in the mothership like it was made
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the taste on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to hit this, clear my palate
and then we're going to do the sublimator
[SPEAKER_02]: rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as Rob's hitting this,
I'll be saying one or two is the intense
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor of the last that we were hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's five year cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just amazing.
You can definitely see the taste the
difference and you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like you went from Rolls Royce
down to Ferrari, which is nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but definitely I can't wait to put some
resin into a little container and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay near on it and celebrate in 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see you guys do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you've got a little piece of
your favorite resin, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it to stay the same,
you can seal it in an almost oxygen
[SPEAKER_02]: starved environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are ways to replace the oxygen with
nitrogen, which will hold the resin and
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenes in contact, or you can just
put it in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get away with that for quite a
long time without the resin changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you want to cure it, you can put
it in glass, you can put it in wood,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can put it in a variety of places,
dark and cool places, much like a wine
[SPEAKER_02]: cellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can affect slowly, you know,
by slowly changing the terpene content,
[SPEAKER_02]: you affect the modulation of the
cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something worth kind of
experimenting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my cannabis goes into jars like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, it's a kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, three months is an average good cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you can really start getting the
full flavors out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's when you get rid of all of
the chlorophyll stuff that's out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a really full flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And burping your jars every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same with hash or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a fine wine the way I look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we hit this dabbed in the hole or
should we drop it into the bowl and hit it
[SPEAKER_01]: down?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we drop it into the bowl,
we should heat the bowl up first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one thing that Enrico always talks
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are going to drop it in the bowl,
you leave the unit on the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the bowl hot is part of how the
sublimator works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take a super long time,
but it's definitely something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with something like that being so
resiny and gooey, almost like an oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think putting it in the hole might be,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I describe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of you guys out there that are
hitting all these shatters and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, they would look at that and 100% be
like, oh, that looks like killer shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything, you would laugh and go,
yeah, wait till you try this because
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the genuine trueness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a lot of guys that look like,
but I mean, what I see is I see see
[SPEAKER_01]: through gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, if you can peel this off,
it's completely okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we took it outside for a few minutes,
it would get so cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would peel off very nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keeping in mind the reason it's so
dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when you post this on Instagram,
a lot of the younger VHO kids saw this and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were like tamed soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think dirty nasty butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some, some would be like,
oh no, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some would be like, oh no, that's not the
good stuff at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, it's not VHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's give it a shot through the
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try a little, a little dab for starters.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see how it hits fairly
exceptionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tasted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herb got left in there.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it felt a little hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the herb is very dark,
it's still not burned, which is quite
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we turned the sublimator up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to redo that hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause really, how do you, how do you call
that a hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been coughing and puffing like mad
dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are keeping up at home and
puffing a bowl with us each time we puff a
[SPEAKER_02]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But easier for a lot of people too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, most people we know are around
puffing, puffing marathons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be much smoother.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be so much smoother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even going to be funny.
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more master kush for me and we're
going to call it a night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great hanging out with John,
sampling his incredible kushes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Christmas kushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's been great hitting the D nail and
the sublimator as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the oil slick guys for all the
cool silicone based.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, you can throw your hash
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to, when I leave my hash out
personally, hash of this caliber,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little technical difficulty and
we lost our ending.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to say goodbye to you guys
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were thanking a few of the companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were thanking D nail and sublimator,
oil slick, medtainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trippy sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to thank all those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to finish it off with a little
dab of hash and see you guys next time on
[SPEAKER_02]: puff Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's see now.
Nice
[SPEAKER_02]: explosion on the D nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is some of that powdered dry
sift on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
