[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take you guys through a
Jamaican video that I filmed a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago at Emancipation Park in
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I've put a few videos up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the Kronix, Kalisa and Kabaka
Pyramid with Zinc Fence Band at Tony's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony's Bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch more tunes from that
particular show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exile the Brave opened up and I have a
bunch of him as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have more of Jah Nine, both from
Free Park and Emancipation Park as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: from her CD release party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a bunch of other stuff
that I just collected over that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular show that I'm about to
show you, it's actually up on my computer
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, just getting edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a free concert at Emancipation
Park, Reggae in the Park, that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing every Sundays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had hooked up with iWayne to tell
him a little bit about the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: monetization and how he could potentially
be reaping some rewards from his views as
[SPEAKER_00]: he did have some very good views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pretty stoked to see iWayne as
he's got a great voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really talented individual,
so I was excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And halfway through his show, someone that
I've waited a very long time to see in
[SPEAKER_00]: concert, I've waited till three,
four in the morning and missed this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I waited one time till nine o'clock in the
morning at a Tony Rebel salute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only as I got in the van and drove
away did I hear the mention that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be taking the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who I'm talking about of course is Sisla
Kalungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular video, we've got
Sisla Kalungi, we've got iWayne and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Sisla does two or three short
songs and iWayne does a really nice new
[SPEAKER_00]: song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was a freestyle that he
was spitting or something that he wrote,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he does announce in the video that it
was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure I'm gonna have a little
sublimator rip and get this party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little sublimator rip through the
mothership and I'm hitting the Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little nice sativa action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get us ready for this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, why don't you guys pull up a puff
and we'll watch this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a nice light sublimator hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the sublimator is still
heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I put in here was a pinch of bud,
if you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing more, no dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you get another one or two giant
beautiful rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more and we'll enjoy this concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, iWayne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sisla Kalungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on and get down to my mom for a
basket piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it have to be this way?
What do you say?
What do you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it have to be this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see the rap and you love the rap,
it's going to press the whole place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speak the truth and cause it what it way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you serve a hide and do the rock will
continue to do the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mean war.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mean war.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mean war.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mean war.

[SPEAKER_02]: Balance it then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Must get a chance up in you for them,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or run in and go on some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, wake up with boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up with him and all type of pace and
a tap out and a rum cast it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So watch it now.
