[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then you kind of like the boards
turning too Yeah, exactly when you do this
[SPEAKER_01]: it puts the board over there you really
gotta try but then it's like I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: break my ankles good to try that stuff
without the motor Yeah, well that was
[SPEAKER_01]: about seven minutes of non-stop fun break
for sure yeah Absolutely Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down for having a quick little dab I
suppose I Should pose I should pose and up
[SPEAKER_01]: in yeah the Classic one uppery so I don't

getting I don't use any taxis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got I got out of using taxis I started
sort of while using the whole day and sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of walking around Vancouver and really now
it's really really good to know I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: board and it's like cruise around around
the block work in the morning I'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: totally pumped because I be carving all
the way along the seawall to work and by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I get there I'm just like yeah
And then zooming by guys on bicycles I
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled up to a stop sign today and I and I
and I hit the brake too much so the board
[SPEAKER_00]: went backwards and it flew me off like two
steps and then the guys like That boards
[SPEAKER_00]: as big as a snowboard and I'm like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really bouncy, too And the
light turns green and I'm like and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: electric And I just took off and all I

looking forward to as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple that I saw that had Just
no no big batteries And stuff the motors
[SPEAKER_01]: were much smaller interchangeable,
but that's another key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if these ones which are pretty big
batteries I I would probably put up with
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three of them in my backpack and
roll around the city if I could just You
[SPEAKER_01]: know for a city I wonder if any of these
portable vaporizer batteries have anything
