[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, Bubble Man here, freshly arrived
in Negril, Jamaica and I am standing out
[SPEAKER_05]: in front of the I&I restaurant here in
Negril in Westmoreland and it is owned by
[SPEAKER_05]: some good friends of mine actually from
Ontario and we're going to kind of take a
[SPEAKER_05]: little tour in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually sitting right over there
with the dab rig all set up because I have
[SPEAKER_05]: been here about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we start the tour guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the places you're going to
stop when you come into Negril.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to go right to the cliffs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got their dab star lounge bar,
little dab bar up here with a rig and a
[SPEAKER_05]: volcano sometimes that sits on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicely, nicely done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely super cool and a nice little
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some shade, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Negril.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a trip to roll into Negril and see
you walking down the street, Chester.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognized you from the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that's Chester for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, so we got some fresh, fresh
lemonade.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some OJ or is this, did he say
there was turmeric and something else in
[SPEAKER_05]: here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so that's the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the mothership and the dabinator
already set up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty much ready to dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a little quick indoor tour too.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up chef?
[SPEAKER_05]: Blessed love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys, I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the atmosphere, it feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just started painting the inside,
we're going to finish that soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Mark, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: King Charlo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, aye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye and aye restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah man, this is some natural carrot,
we call it Ayrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Aytals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah man, and Irish is, what do you call
it, Irish potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, Aytal is equal to vegan back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We blend this coconut, you get all your
milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural milk, no salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the flavor, the coconut milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it down to Chester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, welcome Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: The roundabout.
[SPEAKER_05]: 0.3 kilometers from the roundabout.
[SPEAKER_05]: Standard crazy road driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I drive a scooter a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the world's greatest supermoto
guy was asked if he drives in the streets
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's like, no, never.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, well why don't you drive in
the streets?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, well, the idiot didn't see
cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would kill you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, damn, that guy pretty much put
it right out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, he just rides on like
multi-million dollar tracks.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can go as fast as he wants with no
idiots in any cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, exactly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll kill you dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean my father died on a motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still go on them, so it's not going to
stop me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely be careful.
Always careful on the two wheels.
Chester.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that'd be some tasty.
I don't know, because I don't smoke any of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: People get between 500 and 800.
[SPEAKER_04]: Closer to 500.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at about 580 right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold it down in Necker Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down 10 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been here about 10 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you guys briefly last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't really able to sit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, dude, what the fuck are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, everybody was at the table
too, and I was just kind of like,
ah.
He was working with the board.
He worked his butt off.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Did you see the sweat?
Woo!
He was working it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are talking about the Sea Star Inn,
where I ran bubble and I did the past
[SPEAKER_05]: church on Sunday a couple of months back
when Jamaica was having its first cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cup along with the Ruth Rastafari cup.
It was a good time as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ruth Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_07]: They figured it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were never going to get permission
themselves, so they went to a rasta group.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I think would be a little
bit better is that rasta didn't invite all
[SPEAKER_05]: other rasta groups.
Not necessarily on the monetary side.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to invite them in if we had
them, and have the bo-bos and the biggies
[SPEAKER_04]: and the 12 bo-bos.
And it wasn't very specific to the rasta
group.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saving it, bird eye.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saving it.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of the yellow Mexicans that smell
that lemon.
That's my favorite.
That's my favorite.
Mexicans.
Yeah, Mexicans.
I love Mexicans.
That's heaven.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get some Mexicans.
Yeah, Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's a foamy Mexicans drink.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, the pressure is so high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were hitting so close, but he said
when I hit the first bowl, he went,
[SPEAKER_05]: nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it right when I put the carb on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the pipe goes from being clear,
a little foggy, to smoky like.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he said, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he was just saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you're sucking air.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like making it just like a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the smoke basically gets more intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smell the Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little Mex-tiza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is this family?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where else, Jester?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where else?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean exact?
[SPEAKER_07]: When the camera's off.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an incredible song.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so, so, a rope.
[SPEAKER_08]: He meant what he said.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't that song.
[SPEAKER_04]: Divine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Divine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either divine or heavenly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're kind of close to each
other.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of close to each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: The divine I think might be in heaven.
[SPEAKER_07]: The divinity of the trinity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Living life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: 14.
[SPEAKER_07]: 15 in two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter's name is Destiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Hindu Kush Valley and get
funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, who had the last Mex-tiza?
[SPEAKER_05]: He did.
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs a Mex-tiza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he can have another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your race works so well that you're not
getting what you're using.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we could.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it down low.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the right arm champs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should put a cover on each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we just got to the spa boutique in
Negril.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the closer to four or five star
places here in Negril.
[SPEAKER_05]: Owned by a really cool Canadian couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't actually met them yet but
they're supposed to be really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've invited us through our friends to
come and set up the dab rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mothership and the dabinator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're going to go do that for
sunset here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This absolutely stellar place.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up boys?
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys ready to do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we are here in Negril.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the egg.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sunset egg.
[SPEAKER_05]: The egg right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So beautiful to be here on the sunset.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're just trying to get the
current working.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the dab unit plugged in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chester's talking to our new friend,
the judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a criminal justice judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hanging out in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting everything done and just enjoying
some sunsets here on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get my fat head out of the way so you guys
can actually enjoy it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll get some dabs here real
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spa retreat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our neighbor across from the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to hit it up with... Let's
do a little west coast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunset.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you kind of have that sunset in
the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the nicer sunsets in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sea's been so rough for weeks,
like almost a month now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nice and calm today for Bubble
Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing it up at the spa retreat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the waterless dab, but I have to
say it was really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put water in for these guys
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a waterless dab would give you a
turping taste though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well why don't you try and then let me
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try the bioassay, Chester.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the sun setting right between us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice man, it's so perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The waterless dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dab culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty nice, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh the turping taste is killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we go, we get the electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to hold that Chester?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold it where I'm holding it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and no higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you'll burn yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Burn out man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to explain a quick little thing about
how all the ocean water is recycled
[SPEAKER_02]: through and the Canadian ownership?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I would like to say something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to say hello to Shane back in
Ottawa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wish you were here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying brother,
but at least we're here at your spa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rose is doing fine man.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same with the address, check us out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane and Christine's place here at the
spa retreat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your hospitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful Canadian people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, very nice, very kind of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've come a long way where we can
somewhat normalize the use of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: where most people don't look at us like
we're nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always a few, which is okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was just asked to leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did they ask her to leave?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, she was drinking or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a topsy turvy world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit it Mikey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mikey roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mikey roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the best genetics on earth perhaps.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll check that out when he has something
to show us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, let me check Google real
quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could check bubble man,
which is all over Google.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh you guys are killing man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo doggy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, we already know each
other.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just didn't get the red.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay Shane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosa wants a hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosa wants a hit, I thought Rosa wants a
hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your fight, 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice Mike, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice guys.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sunset.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super tangy from DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Booyah, saltless butter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tangy is the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: From Teal man, those guys are killers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strong boy, strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a sunset like this in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
