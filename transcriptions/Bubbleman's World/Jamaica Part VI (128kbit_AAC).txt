[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm tempted to
say... Some of you know it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You did see them running around the
streets of Kingston two years ago on film.
[SPEAKER_08]: Particularly as we celebrated our 50th.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are Nomads!
[SPEAKER_04]: Greetings, greetings, greetings and love,
one and all.
[SPEAKER_04]: To my right, right wing conservative bird
eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're free to clap if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: The not for rent attract.
[SPEAKER_04]: To my left, far left, left wing liberal
evy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The homeless gene.
[SPEAKER_06]: To his right, my left honey pea.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mild mannered citizen.
[SPEAKER_06]: On drums, percussions, we have Upi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Publiship.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm your returning resident baby.
Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be waiting for you baby.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me that one chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me pile up through the clouds for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be waiting for you baby.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me that one chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me pile up through the clouds for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladies, I've been wanting to tell.
[SPEAKER_14]: For you to know the way that I feel.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I heard that you've been calling.
[SPEAKER_14]: For love that's extra special and real.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know I can make it better.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can stick by you in any weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said if you want someone to say
true.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can be the guy for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be waiting for you lady.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me that one chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me pile up through the clouds for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to go mad.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be waiting for you lady.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me that one chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me pile up through the clouds for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladies, I've been wanting to tell.
[SPEAKER_14]: For you to know the way that I feel.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said I've heard that you've been
calling.
[SPEAKER_14]: For love that's extra special and real.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know I can make it better.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can stick by you in any weather.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want someone to say true.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can be the guy for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladies, I'll be waiting for you lady.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me that one chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me pile up through the clouds for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to go mad.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be waiting for you lady.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me that one chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me pile up through the clouds for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can be the guy for you.
I know who you are queen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, let's rise now.
In honor for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we are acknowledging the arrival of
our Prime Minister and we welcome her
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been quite a day for her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Prime Minister, I did explain to the
best of my ability and extend the apology
[SPEAKER_08]: for you not being here by suggesting what
your schedule has been like today.
[SPEAKER_08]: But could we just put our hands together
for the young men on the stage who are
[SPEAKER_08]: leaving the stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of being upstaged, they were just
upstaged by the arrival of the Prime
[SPEAKER_08]: Minister.
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course as performers we understand
how that goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to get you up to speed, Madam Prime
Minister, we've had the testimonials and
[SPEAKER_08]: that was a performance by no man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm now going to be asking the
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_08]: Health to come forward and speak on behalf
of Dr Fenton Ferguson.
[SPEAKER_08]: So may I ask Dr Kevin Harvey to come
forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most Honorable Prime Minister,
Honorable Ministers, Permanent
[SPEAKER_10]: Secretaries, members of the industry,
Professor Morrison, Dr Lou and many
[SPEAKER_10]: others, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed
a pleasure to be a part of this historical
[SPEAKER_10]: occasion.
[SPEAKER_10]: I must commend the National Commission on
Science and Technology for moving forward
[SPEAKER_10]: with the vision of the most Honorable
Prime Minister to develop the national
[SPEAKER_10]: nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Jamaica we are fortunate to have a
large reserve of natural resources,
[SPEAKER_10]: including plants that are known to have
healing and other properties.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, last year the Minister of Health
participated in the launch of the
[SPEAKER_10]: anti-cancer research laboratory at the
University of the West Indies,
[SPEAKER_10]: which will be seeking to use indigenous
plants from which to derive substances
[SPEAKER_10]: that are cancer fighting as well as are
able to prevent cancers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica has several types of plants,
herbs and natural waters with mineral
[SPEAKER_10]: reserves that are only found here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This means that there is a great economic
potential in such an industry and so we
[SPEAKER_10]: need to promote and get our people
involved in developing our national health
[SPEAKER_10]: products.
[SPEAKER_10]: As modern technology developed,
the world saw an increase in the offering
[SPEAKER_10]: of natural and food products that purport
to have healthy and healing properties.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a growing sector that if navigated
adequately and carefully can have
[SPEAKER_10]: economic, social and health benefits.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our interest in health is for Jamaicans to
observe a healthy lifestyle towards
[SPEAKER_10]: achieving the national development goal of
a healthy and stable population by 2030.
[SPEAKER_10]: We continue to promote the use of fresh
fruits and vegetables and other healthy
[SPEAKER_10]: natural dietary choices as our first
options.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to reduce the consumption of
processed and fast foods.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which tend to have high levels of sodium,
fats and sugars and can contribute to the
[SPEAKER_10]: development of certain non communicable
diseases including cancers and
[SPEAKER_10]: cardiovascular diseases.
[SPEAKER_10]: These ladies and gentlemen are responsible
for more than 70% of deaths in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_10]: not chickpea.
[SPEAKER_10]: From this standpoint, the Ministry of
Health fully supports this initiative.
[SPEAKER_10]: And will continue to work with the
National Commission on Science and
[SPEAKER_10]: Technology towards the development of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: In recognition of our role to register and
regulate products, we are moving forward
[SPEAKER_10]: to push for the amendment of the Food and
Drug Act 1974 and its regulations to
[SPEAKER_10]: ensure that the nutraceutical industry is
adequately represented and properly
[SPEAKER_10]: recognized in law.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also proposing new regulations,
the Complementary and Alternative
[SPEAKER_10]: Professionals Act to regulate
practitioners in the industry as well as
[SPEAKER_10]: facilities from which they operate.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are working with several other
ministries and hope to soon be at a stage
[SPEAKER_10]: where we can begin consultations with
stakeholders in a bid to ultimately
[SPEAKER_10]: receive cabinet approval for this new act.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamaica is an agriculturally rich nation
with great potential which includes using
[SPEAKER_10]: this asset effectively to fight diseases
and maintain wellness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am glad that we are now moving in this
positive direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is an
historical moment and the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_10]: Health certainly is pleased to be a part
of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Harvey.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned, you know, using more fresh
fruit and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I sat there, there are things that
I used to eat as a child that I don't say
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore, only when I go to my country.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody know Granadilla?
[SPEAKER_08]: Country people call it Grandidilla.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it, my brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me know it, my friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granadilla, you can eat it, just so you
can make it into a drink.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it is ripe, the place smells so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also worried that we are going to
lose rose apple if we are not careful
[SPEAKER_08]: because I don't see enough rose apple
around the place no more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am convinced that stinking toe
cannot have that reputation and let go of
[SPEAKER_08]: some medicinal property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, no, no stinking toe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Proper people call it Lucas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enough for it to grow up on the King's
house property.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever see it on the fence there?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I am not serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a thing, a country, grow up on a
vine and grow up in a little pimento tree
[SPEAKER_08]: back at the kitchen that time,
you know, outside kitchen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come with me to the hills of Clarendon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know Taian?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not Taia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taian, which is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to come up on Smithville,
Tottenham and discover something here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have no fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have no fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So friends, we really need to go back to
the wonderful products, the fruit,
[SPEAKER_08]: the vegetables, the tubers that we have
and we need to use them.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is nothing I enjoy more than
shelling pimento, but that's for another
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr Lisa Myers Morgan, you are representing
the Honourable Derek Keller.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you come forward?
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dr Lisa Myers Morgan, of course,
with the talk about agriculture and
[SPEAKER_08]: fisheries and all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you come forward, my sister?
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you welcome her?
[SPEAKER_13]: The most honourable Prime Minister,
our Honourable Ministers, our Permanent
[SPEAKER_13]: Secretaries, distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_13]: As the Research Director in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries, I hereby
[SPEAKER_13]: bring greetings on behalf of the
Honourable Minister, Derek Keller,
[SPEAKER_13]: in his capacity as the Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries.
[SPEAKER_13]: In saying that, today's launch marks yet
another important step in our country's
[SPEAKER_13]: quest to diversify our agricultural
production through the development of high
[SPEAKER_13]: valued outputs and to tap into the billion
dollar nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: With a desire for personalised medicine
and the increased demand for preventative
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine, this industry, ladies and
gentlemen, which is expected to reach over
[SPEAKER_13]: US 200 billion globally by 2016,
presents vast opportunities for the
[SPEAKER_13]: agricultural sector and by extension,
the Jamaican economy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Despite the high quality of our spices and
herbs, and the scientific expertise
[SPEAKER_13]: available in Jamaica, our exports have
been relatively small.
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, within the hemisphere,
Brazil has been one of the major providers
[SPEAKER_13]: of raw materials for the industry,
which includes oils, algae and herbs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Given that a variety of medicinal plants
such as guinean weed, saracen and boneless
[SPEAKER_13]: are grown locally, and over 50% of the
established 160 medicinal plants are grown
[SPEAKER_13]: here in Jamaica, we have the potential to
become a major player in this industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if these plants are properly
harnessed, this industry could boost
[SPEAKER_13]: earnings and job creation.
[SPEAKER_13]: With a reduction in preferential markets
for Jamaica's traditional export crops,
[SPEAKER_13]: such as sugar, and in light of the
increasing potential for non-traditional,
[SPEAKER_13]: high value added agricultural products,
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
[SPEAKER_13]: through our export division has embarked
on a sustained and strategic program for
[SPEAKER_13]: the development of flavour, fragrances and
spices.
[SPEAKER_13]: These flavours, fragrances and spices are
extracted from ginger, tumeric,
[SPEAKER_13]: pimento, nutmeg and guinean weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Among our priorities are the expansion of
the spices and spices industry program by
[SPEAKER_13]: increasing our production and yield,
and the introduction of new varieties and
[SPEAKER_13]: increased exports of herbs and spices
through value chain development,
[SPEAKER_13]: for example for powder and oils,
as well as the implementation of quality
[SPEAKER_13]: assurance programs in the spices industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: To this end, we have reestablished the
Jamaican ginger as a dominant product in
[SPEAKER_13]: the global market.
[SPEAKER_13]: And over 60 spice farms have been global
gap certified.
[SPEAKER_13]: As a supplier of the raw materials for the
nutraceutical industry, we are aware of
[SPEAKER_13]: the potential and benefits that this
industry offers to Jamaica's agribusiness
[SPEAKER_13]: sector.
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, Jamaica's informal herbal
industry and the traditional knowledge
[SPEAKER_13]: regarding its many healthy and rich
endemic species are key contextual
[SPEAKER_13]: appropriateness for the establishment of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, given the growing demand for
nutraceutical products, the development of
[SPEAKER_13]: this national nutraceutical industry comes
at a very opportune time.
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact is, finding new market niches for
our crops is of paramount importance.
[SPEAKER_13]: Finding new uses for our crops,
for example our ginger, which is renowned
[SPEAKER_13]: for its potency worldwide, offers good
economic and livelihood potential for our
[SPEAKER_13]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamaica is well positioned in terms of
products, space, land, techniques,
[SPEAKER_13]: and high quality raw materials.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is for these reasons that I welcome the
introduction of this industry focused on
[SPEAKER_13]: nutraceuticals, many of which can be
developed from crops that Jamaica grows
[SPEAKER_13]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_13]: The development of the nutraceutical
industry is not only relevant but timely
[SPEAKER_13]: and important for the development of our
country.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
is very pleased to be a part of this
[SPEAKER_13]: initiative and is committed to working
with the other stakeholders from across
[SPEAKER_13]: the ministries and agencies to ensure its
success.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you and may God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Dr Lisa Mize, Morgan Research
Director.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you done any research with pawpaw?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_08]: The fruit, the leaf, the stem,
or you just settle with the fruit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting, you know, the folklore
in this country about the stem of the
[SPEAKER_08]: pawpaw plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you cut it and put, for example,
a picture in it and leave it there,
[SPEAKER_08]: I gather the picture disappears.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have somebody you want to get
rid of, you can say so if you do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned that in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I've told you that as a research
director, please do not put my picture in
[SPEAKER_08]: there when you're testing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Find a picture of something and put it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I suppose it's a pawpain, I don't know
what it is because pawpaw is a tenderizer,
[SPEAKER_08]: so it must be a nice stem too,
so I'd make that happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: But check it out and tell me, don't put my
picture in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you spoke, again I remember,
anybody in there know Abbe?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, Abbe?
[SPEAKER_08]: Praise the Lord.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, sometimes I swear I'm from a
different era.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear somebody say, yes, I'm one of the
boys coming from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, true, Abbe come like a small coconut.
[SPEAKER_08]: You boil that down and you eat that,
man, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is why we never used to get sick in
our country, you know, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when you're finished with that,
now you have so, so, so of leaf tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially if you have headache or
something, and you quail certain leaf,
[SPEAKER_08]: breadfruit leaf, and you put the quail
leaf on your head, slap it on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then tie a piece of cloth around it,
sorry, and you get rid of the headache.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it is my pleasure to invite the
Honorable Anthony Hilton, Member of
[SPEAKER_08]: Parliament and Minister of Industry,
Investment and Commerce to speak with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Minister, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Masters of Ceremonies, Most
Honorable Prime Minister, Portia
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson-Miller, Colleague Ministers,
Permanent Secretaries, Professor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Honorable Errol Morrison, Director
General of National Science, National
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission of Sciences, Reverend Dr.
Kimondi Cesar, the Chief Research Officer
[SPEAKER_00]: of T-Build USA, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
representatives of the public sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives of the private sector,
members of the media, brothers and
[SPEAKER_00]: sisters, all, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The launch of the national nutraceutical
industry marks an important watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the development of Jamaica's
science-based industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be sure, this effort demonstrates the
direction that the country must further
[SPEAKER_00]: embrace if we are to expect to move
industry up the knowledge chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving up the knowledge chain is critical
to developing value chains and
[SPEAKER_00]: transforming the industrial landscape and
to offer great opportunities for a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific and technical workforce,
entrepreneurs, investors and workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, our country has been
blessed with the natural resources to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the development of a lucrative
nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, Jamaica has more than half,
as the point was made earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than half of the 160 plants declared
worldwide as having medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This natural bounty becomes of greater
significance as the global market for
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceuticals is projected to reach in
excess of 270 billion US dollars in 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: and further to increase to over half.
[SPEAKER_00]: To half a trillion US dollars by 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us therefore take, for example,
as an example, one example, the ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The derivatives of this plant were key to
the pioneering work of respective
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, Dr. West, Lockhart and Lowe,
supported by their teams in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which culminated in the development of
medicinal treatments for glaucoma and
[SPEAKER_00]: asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is therefore propitious that we seek to
formalize a nutraceutical industry while
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously forging ahead with
marijuana reform laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: These reform laws will create a framework
for the development of the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and medicinal marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, by creating this framework,
we are also providing fertile ground for
[SPEAKER_00]: new investment opportunities, including
export diversification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, export
diversification will allow our country to
[SPEAKER_00]: make better use of open distribution
channels, which is key as we look to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: global supply and value chains within the
international trading system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, utilizing these channels is
integral to the transformational effect
[SPEAKER_00]: that a pursuit of a logistic-centered
economy represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the formalization of the new
statistical nutraceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunities to develop the
industrial hemp and medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industries become further magnified.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this end, the Ministry of Industry,
Investment and Commerce has been focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on the regulatory framework for standards
development, intellectual property
[SPEAKER_00]: protection, investment promotion and the
involvement of our micro, small and
[SPEAKER_00]: medium-sized enterprises in order to
enable the development and growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp and medical marijuana
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, a cross-ministry consultative
group has been established and draft
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations governing the establishment of
industrial hemp is at hand and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: subjected further to consultation among
the broad stakeholder groupings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The matter of standards development as an
integral part of a robust quality
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure is of utmost importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is critical to ensuring strict
adherence of products to local and
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally accepted standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my firm belief that this is a key
consideration for the cannabis licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: authority, which will be established along
with the regulations necessary for the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the industrial hemp and
medical marijuana industries in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, the Bureau of Standards is already
undertaking work to create a roadmap to
[SPEAKER_00]: chart the standards development of these
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intellectual property protection is
another key area of focus in facilitating
[SPEAKER_00]: the development of the nutraceutical
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jamaica Intellectual Property Office,
JIPO, will be key in registering Jamaica's
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as we protect our natural
resources, we must also protect our
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this regard, JIPO will examine
intellectual property rights of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rastafari community in aspects of our
traditional knowledge, our traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural expressions, as well as
geographic indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this with the assistance of the
World Intellectual Property Organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: WIPO.
[SPEAKER_00]: JMPRO has been tasked with assessing
investor interests in the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: these industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as we speak, local and international
investors are priming themselves to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of the economic opportunities
that industrial hemp and medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industries will provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, therefore, convinced that although
not one of the focus areas of JIP of 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Jamaica Investment Forum,
we will receive expressions of interest at
[SPEAKER_00]: that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we seek to develop these new
industries, I hope it will empower local
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, especially for medium,
small and micro enterprises, to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: the tremendous potential of Jamaica's
natural bounty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an opportunity for MSMEs to use
our natural resources in ways that will
[SPEAKER_00]: bring us back to our roots while being
innovative and commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and
sisters, it is within our MSMEs that exist
[SPEAKER_00]: the foundations for economic development,
job creation, and an improved standard of
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this regard, the role of the Jamaica
Business Development Corporation becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: integral in the provision of training and
business development services as our MSMEs
[SPEAKER_00]: seek to establish a foothold in these
formalized industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe that the development of
any new industry must be underpinned by
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am therefore happy to see Professor
Al-Morrisi here today, an integral part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this as Director General.
[SPEAKER_00]: The development of these industries will
allow us to move towards a stronger and
[SPEAKER_00]: more prosperous Jamaica, one characterized
by increased foreign exchange earnings,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased employment opportunities ranging
from agriculture to manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an improved social and economic
well-being of all persons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in this spirit that I welcome
today's industrial launch and to welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: you all to a glimpse of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I quite like the phrase, Jamaica's natural
bounty, and I think we all accept and
[SPEAKER_08]: acknowledge that this is historic and that
we are very privileged to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm inviting my young performers to return
at this time, the young men of Nomads.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could just get them to come to the
stage and make their second performance
[SPEAKER_08]: for the afternoon, I'd greatly appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: While they make their way to the stage,
then, I can tell you that if you listen to
[SPEAKER_08]: many of our folk songs, you'll hear
mention made of several of our plants that
[SPEAKER_08]: are so important to healing and that have
been used by our forebears over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of this is intricately titled with
everything else, but definitely with our
[SPEAKER_08]: culture and our heritage, and so much is
recorded through our folk music.
[SPEAKER_08]: We remember the work of people like the
late Dr. Audit Lewin, and she has left a
[SPEAKER_08]: legacy, not only in recorded music,
but in books that she's published,
[SPEAKER_08]: and enjoy their performance, and we will
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nomads for the second time.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only takes a song to get a fire going
and going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come, let's take a walk where green
herbs are growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it is with ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you experience it, you won't believe
you will achieve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd want to pass it on, pass it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: All protocols observed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go.

[SPEAKER_15]: two, three.
[SPEAKER_15]: I said now that we found her, what are we
gonna do with it?
[SPEAKER_16]: I said now that we found her, what are we

[SPEAKER_16]: With it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said now that we found her, what are we
gonna do?
With it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said now that we found her, what are we
gonna do?
[SPEAKER_17]: With it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The story of the mad people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clap your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clap your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clap your hands, please.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clap your hands.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clap your hands.
[SPEAKER_16]: Only the mad people survive.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clap your hands, please.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clap your hands.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're in tune to the sound of the moment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Look here, you're feeling crazy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clap your hands.
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's a man living room.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting off now, I'm getting off now,
watch here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love and love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are my sons.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are a little mad, but they are able
to bring everything in the culture
[SPEAKER_08]: together very nicely as you could hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to almost hit the stage and dinky
many, but I have to remember that the
[SPEAKER_08]: chickpeas, I need them still, and I can't
dinky too hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, and then I hope you realize now that
they were able to move from the
[SPEAKER_08]: traditional folk music into the church
music, rock of ages, in the pop,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, same redeeming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you better understand it, but what I
found most instructive was in that song
[SPEAKER_08]: about the ganja to observe the faces.
[SPEAKER_08]: My brother over here, my rasta friend,
said so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say, all right, validation time now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other people said so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other people said so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prof. Morrison said so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he may research it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Henry Lowe said, all right,
okay, something more to work with.
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, no much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try not to do it 20 years ago,
then lock it up in a whistle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember though, 20 years ago,
Bello and Blaca, in their performance,
[SPEAKER_08]: well, more than 20 now, they used to do a
song called Ganja Tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody remember that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, ganja tree, oh, ganja tree,
remember that?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm going to sing it now
because next time I get myself in trouble,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, this evening, this afternoon,
what you should have seen of faces.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some of you are looking at some
of you, and I laugh after how you look
[SPEAKER_08]: stiff and can't relax.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was so funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time, don't invite no much.
[SPEAKER_07]: But them was good, not true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then clap them again.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're happy to invite them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, hello, normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last one to step out by stage and
don't say goodbye, auntie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Walk your body back here, out of order.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know which party I come from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've known him from about six and seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been a poet, used to write the pieces
for him to perform in festivals,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, bad and pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he came right through from the
primary school level, kind of our primary,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then went straight up, you know,
and the boy, good, subtle, and then the
[SPEAKER_08]: child, you know, his father was there
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's so talented little group,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then go, clap them again.
[SPEAKER_08]: On Wednesday next week, I'm heading to
Claringdon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going down to Denby at the patron for
the Claringdon 4-H clubs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope that the chairman of the 4-H
clubs will be there because Claringdon 4-H
[SPEAKER_08]: clubs will be having their achievement
dates that time of year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I want to invite him now to say
a few words.
[SPEAKER_08]: Senator Norman Grant, come forward,
is chairman of the Jamaica 4-H clubs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We understand the importance of keeping
the youth connected with these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: 4-H movement is powerful and it is
growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Senator?
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, madam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Master of sermons.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most honorable Prime Minister,
Portia Sepsimilo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Minister of State, Robinson.
[SPEAKER_12]: Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Professors Morrison and Lowell.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ladies and gentlemen, members of the
media, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is indeed my pleasure on behalf of the
Jamaica 4-H club to join in saluting this
[SPEAKER_12]: momentous occasion.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, we see it as a game changer.
[SPEAKER_12]: An industry, the nutraceutical industry
that has grown from some 20 billion U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: dollars in the 1990s, 2000, as the
minister indicated, projecting to grow to
[SPEAKER_12]: some 270 billion in 2016 and close to 750
billion in 2018.
[SPEAKER_12]: And arguably projected to grow to a
trillion by 2025 to be one of the world's
[SPEAKER_12]: fastest growing industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You will understand my excitement that the
Jamaica 4-H club that stood at 18,000 in
[SPEAKER_12]: the year 2000 and grew to 70,000 in the
year 2012 to now register a growth of
[SPEAKER_12]: 87,000 clavites.
[SPEAKER_12]: Young persons between the ages of five and
25 with a mandate to adopt in areas of
[SPEAKER_12]: leadership, agriculture, agro-processing
and emerging opportunities.
[SPEAKER_12]: The nutraceutical industry is an emerging
opportunity for the youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to this extent, we're extremely
delighted to note our summoning by the
[SPEAKER_12]: National Council for Science and
Technology reporting to the honorable
[SPEAKER_12]: prime minister to execute a memorandum of
understanding between that council and the
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamaica 4-H club to ensure that our young
people are involved in the development of
[SPEAKER_12]: this moment.
[SPEAKER_12]: The most important and emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a game changer because our 228,000
farmers have an average age of mid-50s.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is declining because in the 1990s
it was mid-60s.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what is exciting is that there are a
number of young persons that are getting
[SPEAKER_12]: involved in agriculture where the 4-H
movement, madam prime minister,
[SPEAKER_12]: is the nursery.
[SPEAKER_12]: And therefore, in keeping with your
instruction, it's a game-changing move for
[SPEAKER_12]: us to have the Jamaica 4-H club movement
participate in this area and give hope for
[SPEAKER_12]: job creation and entrepreneurship to our
youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: I close on this note because I've been
given an opportunity to be brief.
[SPEAKER_12]: Knowing my tendency to be not so brief.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Jamaica 4-H club this year celebrates
75 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd like to take the opportunity to
welcome both Rebecca and Megan from
[SPEAKER_12]: Ontario 4-H Canada who is here with us who
are celebrating 100 years in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we should really come and ask them to
stand.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is a part of the reciprocal that we
will intend to exchange.
[SPEAKER_12]: That we will certainly have their
president coming back to be a part of our
[SPEAKER_12]: 75th celebration.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as we celebrate this momentous
occasion, the Jamaica 4-H club
[SPEAKER_12]: congratulate this movement, the national
nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: An industry that is here to stay.
[SPEAKER_12]: An industry that is here to help the
economy grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: An industry that is here to facilitate
growth and development of our youth in
[SPEAKER_12]: agriculture in keeping with the mandate of
the Ministry of Agriculture and our most
[SPEAKER_12]: honorable prime minister.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will expose our youth in training and
development in the era of entrepreneurship
[SPEAKER_12]: as we seek to grow our economy,
grow the 4-H movement and grow opportunity
[SPEAKER_12]: for our youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: World future so that they can have a
brighter future.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_12]: May God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me just say that the Jamaica
Agricultural Society that forms the 4-H
[SPEAKER_12]: club celebrate 120 years this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is really just a game-changing year.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a year of a whole heap of great
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know the mother prime minister has
all the great things for us.
[SPEAKER_12]: God bless you prime minister as you
continue to lead a wonderful country with
[SPEAKER_12]: great ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Senator Norman Grant.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to just put that bit in about the
JAS and very importantly 120 years and 4-H
[SPEAKER_08]: 75.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very important because one spawns the
other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now ladies and gentlemen, it gives me,
you remember, well you might have come in
[SPEAKER_08]: a little late.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did apologize for the Honorable Philip
Paulwell that he had to leave the island
[SPEAKER_08]: on an urgent mission to do the business of
this country.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said at the time that he would be
ably represented.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's now time for me to invite the
Minister of State and the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_08]: Science, Technology, Energy and Mining,
the Honorable Julian Robinson to bring us
[SPEAKER_08]: an overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much Madam Master of
Sermonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Prime Minister, the most honorable
Portia Simpson Miller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minister Anthony Hilton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Permanent Secretaries who are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The South African Ambassador to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: All distinguished stakeholders who have
been involved in the development of a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we are doing an official launch,
when I listened to the testimonials
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, it's very clear that we have had
a nutraceuticals industry for a very long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As your Master of Sermonies indicated,
Minister Philip Paulwell who would have
[SPEAKER_01]: loved to have been here had to travel at
very short notice today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also the Vice Chairman of the
National Council on Science and Technology
[SPEAKER_01]: and he would have absolutely loved to have
been here to share in this historic
[SPEAKER_01]: occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ministry of Science, Technology,
Energy and Mining works closely with the
[SPEAKER_01]: National Council for Science and
Technology while the Scientific Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Council is one of the lead agencies of the
Ministry and has been mandated to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: new products that can be produced and
marketed by micro, small and medium sized
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprises to create viable businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the Ministry the government is
currently reviewing the National Science
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology and Innovation Policy,
STI, as part of the process to improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: contribution of science, technology and
innovation to national development and the
[SPEAKER_01]: achievement of sustainable economic
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year the NCST was resuscitated and is
ably led by Professor Errol Morrison and
[SPEAKER_01]: its mandate renewed in order to give
momentum to these efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then a committee has been
established headed by Professor Kawa from
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of the West Indies to
update the science, technology and
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The push to expand the use of and access
to new and appropriate technology by
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaicans is crucial to the country's
progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not going to progress as a society
if we continue to focus on being primary
[SPEAKER_01]: producers only.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not going to get there unless we
use science and technology to inculcate a
[SPEAKER_01]: national culture of innovation and the
production of value added goods and
[SPEAKER_01]: services.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commission which is chaired by our
Prime Minister has ratified a proposal for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to move with alacrity towards greater
popularization of science and technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only in the formal sector but in the
informal sector as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new direction of the commission will
reflect a joined up government approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be greater synergy and
coordination and we will see increased
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on science, technology and
innovation through the government and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the implementation of public policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in this context that the launch of
this national nutraceuticals industry
[SPEAKER_01]: assumes great significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already the steering committee headed by
Professor Morrison reflects the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: of interest in both the public and the
private sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agencies such as the scientific research
council, the bureau of standards,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the ministries of health,
agriculture, stem and industry investment
[SPEAKER_01]: and commerce are all included as we move
forward to develop this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that while the state and
government agencies have a critical
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitatory and regulatory role,
the industry cannot achieve the desired
[SPEAKER_01]: results without the private sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by private sector here we're not just
talking about big businesses but big,
[SPEAKER_01]: medium and small size enterprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: The private sector or young entrepreneurs
or scientists and innovators must see
[SPEAKER_01]: science, technology and innovation to grow
this industry, to generate new products
[SPEAKER_01]: and to enhance production and
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, agriculture must
increasingly give way to agri-industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouse technology, bioenergy,
tissue culture, electronic commerce and
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing must drive enhanced
productivity, increase competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Importantly also, value added production
must overtake primary production.
[SPEAKER_01]: These elements must be central to the
viability and sustainability of this
[SPEAKER_01]: national nutraceuticals industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our prime minister has identified the
orderly development of Jamaica's
[SPEAKER_01]: nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She cherishes the cultural connection that
our forebearers have with their natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's plants and healing waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But her connection is not merely emotive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard economic facts are that the
nutraceutical industry is the fastest
[SPEAKER_01]: growing segment of the health products
industry, overtaking even the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When our prime minister speaks,
she speaks not only with passion,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with the knowledge and assurance that
given the opportunity, our people will
[SPEAKER_01]: help to unleash the tremendous potential
of our indigenous herbs, medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and healing waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me
in welcoming the chairman of the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Council on Science and Technology,
our prime minister of Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most honorable Portia Simpson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: The master of ceremonies is Kay Ellington.
[SPEAKER_09]: Reverend Dr. Stephen Jennings.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honorable Julian Robinson.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honorable Anthony Hilton.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Lisa Myers-Morgan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Representing the Honorable Derek Kelley.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Kevin Harvey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Permanent secretary representing the
Minister of Health.
[SPEAKER_09]: Minister of Health pouring today is not a
very happy day because today he had to be
[SPEAKER_09]: at the funeral of his mom.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is why he's not here this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Professor, the Honorable Errol Morrison,
our director general, National Commission
[SPEAKER_09]: on Science and Technology, members of the
Diplomatic Corps, heads of international
[SPEAKER_09]: organizations, senators,
[SPEAKER_09]: permanent secretaries, Mr. Norman Grant,
Mr. Norman Wright.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to recognize the presence of
members of the Rastafarian community of
[SPEAKER_09]: the nutraceutical industry in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: My firm belief in and unshakable support
for this industry is anchored in the view
[SPEAKER_09]: that it has the potential to transform the
fortunes of our economy and society.
[SPEAKER_09]: The industry is growing rapidly globally.
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 years ago, the worldwide business in
nutraceuticals was estimated to be worth
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 billion U.S.
dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has already surpassed initial
projections of U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: 200 billion dollars by 2018 and is no
projection estimated to be valued at 600
[SPEAKER_09]: billion dollars by 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ladies and gentlemen, nutraceuticals are
from food sources with extra health
[SPEAKER_09]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also include medicinal plants and
natural mineral waters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our mineral water in Jamaica, I think,
perhaps is the best.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have several sources of mineral water
here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: The healing powers of our waters at Bath
in St. Thomas, Millgrave and Clarendon,
[SPEAKER_09]: and Rockfort in Kingston have already been
established.
[SPEAKER_09]: These must be the foundation of a
revitalized wellness industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 160 plants known and declared
worldwide as having medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_09]: At least 86 of those plants are endemic to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: We already have a well-established
tradition of folk medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of us can, as we recall our parents'
and grandparents' knowledge, and use of
[SPEAKER_09]: healing bush remedies.
[SPEAKER_09]: They made teas, applied dressing,
and treated various illnesses with great
[SPEAKER_09]: success.
[SPEAKER_09]: Today, we still enjoy a variety of teas,
wines, tonic drinks, and applications made
[SPEAKER_09]: from indigenous plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: This traditional knowledge is embedded in
a rich cultural legacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: This legacy has been underutilized and
unexploited for serious economic gain for
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica and its people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are sitting on a gold mine in terms of
the potential gains from the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: The possible economic benefits for Jamaica
are tremendous.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thousands of new jobs can be created
through mass cultivation and employment in
[SPEAKER_09]: labs and processing plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a potential for increased revenue
from greater earning power of new workers.
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be more foreign exchange
through greater exports and the
[SPEAKER_09]: development of medical tourism.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lower cost of livestock production and an
agricultural boost will result from more
[SPEAKER_09]: cost-effective livestock feed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ladies and gentlemen, preliminary studies
have shown that animals, particularly
[SPEAKER_09]: poultry fed with botanicals, certainly
demonstrate accelerated growth and better
[SPEAKER_09]: quality meat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Cuba is one country now in feeding
animals with some of these things that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was indicated that the meat is
different and tastes certainly better.
[SPEAKER_09]: With the development of the nutraceutical
industry, there will be world-class
[SPEAKER_09]: exposure for more Jamaican scientists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we have several great scientists
in Jamaica, and I'm sure that this will
[SPEAKER_09]: assist because the world will know about
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be the development of several
new industries.
[SPEAKER_09]: For these reasons, I am determined that my
administration will be moving in a serious
[SPEAKER_09]: way to develop the nutraceutical industry
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an integral part of a national
strategic approach for ensuring economic
[SPEAKER_09]: growth, development, and job creation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not starting from scratch because
some pioneering work has been done.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the 1950s, Dr. Johnston St. Elizabeth
used rambot roses for treating diabetes.
[SPEAKER_09]: A group of visitors took the plants to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scientific investigations in Canada
yielded two drugs for treating certain
[SPEAKER_09]: types of blood cancers.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the 1970s, Dr. Manley West,
Albert Lockhart, and Henry Low were
[SPEAKER_09]: working on the ganja plant that yielded
extracts from successfully treating
[SPEAKER_09]: glaucoma and asthma.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very happy that Dr. Lou is here
with us this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Work has continued over the years with
important contributions from Professors
[SPEAKER_09]: Errol Morrison, Harvey Reed, and Helen
Asimoto.
[SPEAKER_09]: And their teams at the University of the
West Indies.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Scientific Research Council has done
work developing tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_09]: formulating products like extracts of
lemongrass known as fibagrass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those of us who grew up in deep rural
Jamaica are well aware of the fibagrass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another Caribbean university team led by
Professor Paul Giles and Vincent Wright
[SPEAKER_09]: has done important work on ginger and
sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Henry Low is now doing groundbreaking
work on ganja, old man's beard,
[SPEAKER_09]: lignum vitae, and guinea hen weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me tell you something, I personally
believe if there's one country in the
[SPEAKER_09]: world with plants and herbs with the cure
for cancer, it is here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are several small enterprises around
the island producing nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_09]: These products are in need of
standardization, testing, monitoring,
[SPEAKER_09]: and quality assurance because we want to
ensure that the things that the people are
[SPEAKER_09]: taking will have no impact on their level
or having to impact their health in any
[SPEAKER_09]: negative way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are doing the testing and I think
that is important and I'm sure Dr.
[SPEAKER_09]: Morrison and Dr. Low would have nothing
else than having that done.
[SPEAKER_09]: The National Commission on Science and
Technology is leading an effort that is
[SPEAKER_09]: working on plans to regularize and develop
a sustainable nutraceutical industry in
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps, maybe, and I reckon Benjamin will
begin to plant up some of this place in
[SPEAKER_09]: terms of the plants and the herbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I heard somebody mention and
sentiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Today's launch heralds the start of a
system to encourage, regulate,
[SPEAKER_09]: and monitor production locations processes
and products to ensure that they meet
[SPEAKER_09]: national and international standards.
[SPEAKER_09]: Going forward, we must attract and engage
large investors to maximize the wealth
[SPEAKER_09]: potential of the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just think of India, what their plants and
herbs are doing in India.
[SPEAKER_09]: And not only remaining in India,
but globally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine if Jamaica, that is one of
the most, I might get into trouble for
[SPEAKER_09]: this, but I'm gonna say it anyhow,
the most known country in our region.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe the most popular country in
our region.
[SPEAKER_09]: If not through Bob Marley, it's through
Usain Bolt and Shelley and Freeland.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a prize.
[SPEAKER_09]: But our musical icons that Jamaica
produced.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yes, we produce some great sons and
daughters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether we want to talk about those that
university to produce like a Rex
[SPEAKER_09]: Nettleford and others.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a great country and a great people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I keep on begging Jamaicans
to behave in keeping with the great
[SPEAKER_09]: goodness of our ancestors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the number of great Jamaicans that
Jamaica produced both male and female.
[SPEAKER_09]: Several companies are already expressing
interest in large scale production and
[SPEAKER_09]: commercialization of products from
Jamaica's abundant medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to pause to commend Dr. Lu,
honorable Dr. Lu.
[SPEAKER_09]: For not only doing significant scientific
work, but for also investing in financial
[SPEAKER_09]: terms.
[SPEAKER_09]: In financial terms, Jamaica's
nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: He believes in the nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: He is pushing ahead with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go to his place and you see these many
things produced from Dr. Lu's lab of
[SPEAKER_09]: medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaican product, not products from
elsewhere, but Jamaican products.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you Dr. Lu for leading the
way in something that I believe in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those of us who was brought up in deep
rural Jamaica know you have the fever in
[SPEAKER_09]: the morning and your mom does something by
evening you're running up and down fever
[SPEAKER_09]: gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaican plants and herbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You spray your uncle, mommy beat up
something, custard apple leaves and some
[SPEAKER_09]: rum and something pour on a tag.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll never feel pain again in your life
after it is better.
[SPEAKER_09]: When it is said by our doctors in Jamaica
that if you hurt your uncle, every now and
[SPEAKER_09]: then you'll feel pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not true, I hurt my uncle.
[SPEAKER_09]: My mom dealt with it and I never felt a
pain again.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see how I can run?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to include all stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_09]: Already a memorandum is to be signed with
the Jamaica 4-H movement to engage the
[SPEAKER_09]: country's youth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some 8,500 young people in 4-H clubs
across the country will benefit from the
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunities along the value chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: The partnership in its initial stages will
focus on the establishment of greenhouses
[SPEAKER_09]: and gardens and strengthening 4-H programs
within some.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am advised that at least two companies
have expressed an interest in establishing
[SPEAKER_09]: tissue culture farms in Jamaica to enhance
the multiplication of botanicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: These tissue culture farms will create
hundreds of jobs for new college graduates
[SPEAKER_09]: and high school graduates with science
background.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only can the graduates be gainfully
employed but these farms provide the
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunity for the new workers to apply
theory, to practice, therefore setting the
[SPEAKER_09]: stage for further innovations.
[SPEAKER_09]: All government agencies must be made more
focused on assisting small and large
[SPEAKER_09]: nutraceutical business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want them to know and I'm going to
ensure because the cabinet is already
[SPEAKER_09]: aware of my interest in this area and in
this industry and I will be one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: persons helping Dr. Low to spread the good
news for the nutraceutical industries.
[SPEAKER_09]: These agencies include especially the
scientific research council, government
[SPEAKER_09]: chemists, the intellectual property
office, the business development
[SPEAKER_09]: corporation and the bureau of standard and
jam pro minister.
[SPEAKER_09]: The joint government approach is needed
for this exciting industry to move forward
[SPEAKER_09]: and I do not believe everybody,
every agency of government going on their
[SPEAKER_09]: own and doing what they feel to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this thing, this one, this
important industry must be done with a
[SPEAKER_09]: united effort by way of joint government.
[SPEAKER_09]: We must examine existing institutions and
reposition them to be responsive to the
[SPEAKER_09]: needs of this non-traditional industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: This industry I believe is also ideal for
the kind of private public partnership
[SPEAKER_09]: that has worked well in other areas and so
we will want to ensure we form a
[SPEAKER_09]: partnership with the private sector we
already have, Dr. Low.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fulfilling its mandate, the NCST has
laid the foundation, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_09]: for the development of a national
nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: The industry is based on scientific
research to drive the commercialization of
[SPEAKER_09]: products including teas, fortified water,
dietary supplements and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a dynamic market here in Jamaica,
in the diaspora and globally.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a growing niche market for these
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the United States alone there are an
estimated 20 million health enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also the air of medical tourism
linked to our mineral baths.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica will be joining more than 50
countries that officially recognize it as
[SPEAKER_09]: a national industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Estimates of the value of the global
medical tourism industry have been put at
[SPEAKER_09]: some U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 billion.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to congratulate those practitioners
who have pushed ahead despite the odds and
[SPEAKER_09]: I urge you to give a helping hand to the
new entrants in the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I once again want to commend Dr. Low and
Professor Errol Morrison, that inseparable
[SPEAKER_09]: scientific duo on publishing a new book
which tells the Jamaican story on
[SPEAKER_09]: nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am humbled and honored that the book
that has been dedicated to me in
[SPEAKER_09]: recognition of my advocacy and support for
the Jamaican nutraceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you very much,
gentlemen, and I trust that you will
[SPEAKER_09]: acquire this book, those of you who are
present here this evening, and learn of
[SPEAKER_09]: the scientific underpinnings, the hurdles
to be overcome and the vision for the
[SPEAKER_09]: future.
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed, much is expected from this trust
in nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_09]: I commend the many practitioners and other
entities exhibiting their products here
[SPEAKER_09]: today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can learn from and understand that
there are representatives here from the
[SPEAKER_09]: maroon community and the maroons were also
known for the use of plants and herbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: To all those who work to ensure this
launch, I salute your efforts.
[SPEAKER_09]: We expect that the launch will serve as a
catalyst for the growth and development of
[SPEAKER_09]: a vibrant and sustainable nutraceutical
industry in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am sure that with our plants and
herbs, if we can't develop the best and
[SPEAKER_09]: the largest nutraceutical industry in this
country, something is wrong with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have faith in the leaders leading
this charge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to commend them and to thank
them and to say to them, you have my full
[SPEAKER_09]: support.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any minister or minister give you trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just give me one call, I will not be far
away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure I have Julian's support as I
know I have Minister Paul's support in
[SPEAKER_09]: this area.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't find me, find Julian.
[SPEAKER_09]: He will be with it for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your interest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your interest and support.
[SPEAKER_09]: May God continue to bountifully bless our
great endowed island nation and those who
[SPEAKER_09]: are involved with this program.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to the rest of parents present,
I say ja.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bless.
Thank you.
