[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fucking A, welcome to Bubbleman's
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's like you live next door,
but you actually live 10 hours away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like coming down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm really glad that you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always appreciate you coming down,
but today is obviously... It's a special
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a special day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So D's been working his ass off for,
well, for months actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this particular instance,
he had a little bit of a kick down that he
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to bring the Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just let you talk about what you
got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's open it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me this jar yesterday and I did
not open it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Waiting for him because I really wanted it
to be opened together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me he wasn't going to open it and
that's why I didn't, but I think he's
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy for not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He shouldn't have said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he could have come home and just hit
every one of these and been like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck is that shit in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a puff today, not a single
puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit my Apex once or twice just because I
can, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the thing with the Apex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just smell that mixture of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got that diesel under there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the diesel in the kush right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like playing with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Goji Oji.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Brooklyn mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plethora.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parchment up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what we're going to do here
today is we're going to do a little taste
[SPEAKER_03]: tester.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the mothership out with the
quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also got the silicon carbide bowl
over there on a fresh whip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought the Swiss perk just so that when
we flip whips from the D-nail,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll be able to have another 14 mil pipe
to put the hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quartz or silicon carbide into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at you like a kid at a candy store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just see your smile in the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't slap the smile off my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't fucking try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Oji.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been cured up for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not overly cured or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin heads, if you looked at them up
close, they wouldn't be wrinkled like
[SPEAKER_01]: little raisins type thing in the curing
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could take it and just basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I love that it's still powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love that it's still powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can, but I can also tap it and it's
still powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an instant press, but it's still
powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I'm going to show you up close
video of each one of these hashes as we
[SPEAKER_03]: open them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you can really see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should hit that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This little hit that you just dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I accept that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now, now this one here, there's,
this is, there's, there's a few OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's from the same OG, but different
screen grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with that static, with the static put
parchment paper trick, that's a carding
[SPEAKER_01]: technique as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what it, what it does is I'll take
the, the set of four screen wood set from
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh headies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll take the, once I, once I've got
it through my big screens and before I
[SPEAKER_01]: start doing the static.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll card it through the different levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I will, then I will card it out
through those screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is that, is I separate
the heads on the different sizes of the
[SPEAKER_01]: screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little darker than,
than it should be like in the other OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's because it's a different screen
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, it just melts like
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: What screen size is this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's the, the 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the ass end tasted pretty good,
but the first hit tasted really nice,
[SPEAKER_03]: really like a nice, intense OG flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a tiny little bit of that sharpness
in the throat where it kind of grabs you,
[SPEAKER_03]: give you a little turp, turp hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the OG 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to just write that down on
here first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes to the 110 and then the
70.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's write that on the backside.
[SPEAKER_02]: One and 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what a gift to get full melt dry sift,
even in just a pile like that alone,
[SPEAKER_03]: let alone a jar with many, many,
many piles like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking to Mark Emery yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were, we, he was on his way out with
Jody, but Darren was like, let's let's
[SPEAKER_03]: play his mark down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had a puff with him since he's
gotten out of jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually hadn't had a puff with him
since he got out of jail either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we invited him over and I think it was
his first time hitting the D nail,
[SPEAKER_03]: this particular nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hit some other types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely his first time hitting a
mothership fab bag and his first time
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting some really nice full melt dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was neat to see his surprise as he
exhaled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he's been smoking shatters and
butanes and all these dabs that he's been
[SPEAKER_03]: given out at the stores for the last
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus he, I think he really noticed the
difference in how small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see him notice when he exhaled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry that I didn't videotape it for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are recorded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're not using videotapes
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, I'm aging myself by saying such
a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, next time I, we hang out with
Mark, we'll do a little video and get a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of words from him and show him
dabbing out on the mothership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's the same old G 70 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell right away just from looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was why I think I was going to
guess this was a 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at it, you look how it looks
grainy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bigger heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you had a bowl of marbles and
you had big marbles in the bowl,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would really see the pronunciation of
each curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a really good way of looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got tiny little marbles and you
filled the bowl from a distance,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could almost look like the bowl was
full of liquid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they were colored and this is
what I'm saying right here, you can really
[SPEAKER_01]: see, obviously you can't, you can't go
like that to that and split it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you're going to do is press it more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could, I could, if I froze it,
if I froze it and gave it a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: these, but then you worry about breaking
the gland.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like doing with that, I've taken
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I did the Tony, so does that with the
water, the water, um, melting,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the, um, the hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need a hair straightener with
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you can do it just on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just press it with your finger and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just did really nice color on this
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I'd say that the, the tackiness of
the hash is, is unique in the sense that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so used to people showing me water
hash that hasn't been dried properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, this, the stickiness of this
and how, how strong it is in the pull and
[SPEAKER_03]: snap, it doesn't break easy and you can
just press it right out real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm excited to dab this flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is the OG again in a 70
micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to be destroyed by the end of
this, uh, session,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I will add is my wake and bake
session.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that feeling when you have
that wake and bake hit, it can last a good
[SPEAKER_03]: hour without even really needing another
rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not going to be the case
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the, um, sliding of the piece on
the nice smooth table with the,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, D nail dab, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of just putting them all here and
then I'm going to go over each one with
[SPEAKER_03]: the camera and show them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that one was destructive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very strong, narcotic high on the OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just very, um, you know, relaxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of the, I wouldn't say anxiety,
but the anxiousness that I have today for
[SPEAKER_03]: getting ready to fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always anxious when I fly and not,
not because I'm afraid of flying,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I am just, yeah, I fucking hate
flying, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like BA Barack is from the eight team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to fucking drug me up,
knock me out, get me on the plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to take me anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not that way at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't like turbulence
obviously, but I don't trip out about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mostly, uh, it's the cannabis,
the hash, the pipe, like having stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I have a license,
it's just like, it still feels like I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not allowed, even though I'm allowed and I
don't mention it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not like, I'm not really like Remo or
Mark Loki who are very like pronounced and
[SPEAKER_03]: loud when they go through the security,
they have all their weed right on them in
[SPEAKER_03]: their bags and stuff and not sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, you know, when they're licensed
stuff and everything, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still prefer to avoid those
interactions for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, yeah, this is the one 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the OG as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one 10 is your favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Lee smelling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at least six months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's stuff from when I was carding it
with the iTunes card and not using the
[SPEAKER_01]: static trick and everything like that.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it sure looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it goes to show you, you know,
like the carding techniques that I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing for, I don't know, five to 10
years now, we'll get you exactly to this
[SPEAKER_03]: place that we're sitting at.
[SPEAKER_03]: The static parchment trick gets you there
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just any, any time we can
increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still need those screens to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not just sucking heads up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pushing contaminant through and
that's the key with, with the way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I separate, you know, I got the big set of
screens I do initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take that and I separated in the
smaller screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got each grade and then I use my
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use the parchment paper until then
just because it's the parchment paper will
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up too much heads while I'm doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to separate those grades like
we just did here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's darker, lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, which is why I sell those
screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why those screens are there to
separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I have a four screen set in wood,
they have different microns to do exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: this, to separate out the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not to clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one cleaning screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottom one, the 70 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people always ask me, what are these
other screens for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like to capture heads that are bigger
than those screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those heads are substantially every
single stage is substantially different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bubble bag process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you want to separate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We separate all of our resin glands in
water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we want to do it in dry sift?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, watch for the 10 screen
sift kit coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, but you can look at it if
you're looking at it on the, on the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical charts that they have now with
every single glandular sized head,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything about the THC molecule and
everything that it helps you out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you separate everything one to 10,
even one to four, there's different
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal qualities in each separate one
as you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different for each person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know them all myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not, it's not a standardization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like for one guy who might get the
most out of a 73, another guy might say,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I don't like the 73.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 120 hits me where I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's definitely, this is why bubble
bags went from a three bag to a four,
[SPEAKER_03]: to a six, to a seven, to an eight bag
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: When all of my competition was claiming
that I had no idea what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was using way too many bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, aside from the payload,
who actually added a bag, they have a nine
[SPEAKER_03]: bag kit, which I just have never felt the
necessity to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played around with those numbers and
haven't had enough requests.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's these little things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's back in the day, there were bags,
sidewalls that now nicotine uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those sidewalls came out 10 plus years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, bubble bags experimented with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found that because of the cost of
the screen and the, it just didn't seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: me, A, make a better product or do
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people say it drains the bags faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never, I never found that I can drain
a bag in under 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you can pull a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what did we hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four is an older cured OG,
about six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smell of it is substantially
different as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be our, and we've been
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horatio was talking about off-gas and of
terpenes, but alcohol terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, hydrosols, these like
alcohol-based terpenes that seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: evaporate out the quickest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell them in the fresher ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular with SIFT, that maybe the
material has only been dried for like
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks or maybe a month or two compared to
stuff that was dried for a year,
[SPEAKER_03]: six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like a cleaner, like a pine salt
strong fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like these strong, and so when
you cure hash, those are so volatile,
[SPEAKER_03]: they off-gas in the cure and they're gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they leave, you're left over with
these now subtle terpenes, more subtle,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that can also come across very,
very strong in their scent, which is so
[SPEAKER_03]: strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strange to me that something that
strong could have been suppressed
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes by one of these alcohol terpenes
that are really not even that strong of a
[SPEAKER_03]: smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a blanket where you can't
access those other smells, and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: cure your hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take a genius to get the same
kind of hash, and there's so much learning
[SPEAKER_03]: in this, you guys, like you have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you learn is by separating out all
your grades, curing your hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just like making it the same all the
time, and then smoking it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of this has come to me in
my dreams too.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my sleep, I've woken up and been like,
holy shit, and almost got up and went out
[SPEAKER_01]: to the shop to try that little method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're thinking about it that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a box at home and a list that I'm
gonna, this is my plan on my next video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is D420K.
[SPEAKER_01]: D420K YouTube, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys should check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna have, I've got a list of things
that are positively charged and negatively
[SPEAKER_01]: charged, and I have mostly everything on
that list in this box of tools to see
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what charges the best,
what holds the best charge, what picks up
[SPEAKER_01]: the best, what deflects the best,
you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I've got this Tesla on order.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little, yeah, so I'm gonna see what
it does with that too, and there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can just play around with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play around, yeah, but you know,
the parchment paper is the most,
[SPEAKER_01]: collects the most, separates the worst,
like it really helps out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a quick process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it cuts the time down like
in less than half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Meeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeze McCallman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeze, I just grabbed the wrong bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeze McCallman, YouTube, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fucking trick where it changed
the game in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the iTunes card for me was- Filled
with quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the iTunes card for me was like,
you know, I discovered a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant and then the clean clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I spread that, I shared that
because of course why not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was telling me in his comments
that that was an influence on his part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he come up with that parchment
paper and holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can follow it right back to Skunkman
Sam, through Meeze, to Darren,
[SPEAKER_03]: through me, through Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, it was like, for me it was
direct from, I was lucky enough to have my
[SPEAKER_03]: information come direct from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the sense of just learning about
sifting, because first all he really did
[SPEAKER_03]: was show me sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then I was like, I gotta get like,
I didn't know how he was making it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I looked into, you know, hashish and
it was like screens and I already had a
[SPEAKER_03]: multi-screen keef box and it was like,
okay, we need this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more than one screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I finally got to a point where I
got to a tighter screen and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, like I can card contaminant through,
which only worked because I did it one
[SPEAKER_03]: time accidentally in the very,
very cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it changed the structure of the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It changed everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are trying these techniques in too
warm of condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't get yourself- Spearing your
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't get yourself into the right
conditions, which is cold, cold,
[SPEAKER_03]: cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can do that, then you can start
playing around and doing all these really
[SPEAKER_03]: cool experiments that may or may not hit
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna have a better chance of
hitting if you have the resin in the
[SPEAKER_03]: condition that it needs to be in,
which is A, dry and B, cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry and cold.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that was reminded of me with
when you were telling me about your
[SPEAKER_01]: screens and stuff like that, before when I
got the screens in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I got the tumbler and there's that
stuff, I figured that what you carded
[SPEAKER_01]: through the 70 screen, the bottom cleaning
screen was the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thought that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what was taken from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thought that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right up there with- 70,
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another OG?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even hit this one yet,
have we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pressed up a little hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck's going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: D420K, what's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't actually as enjoyable as these
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still melted just as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just didn't- I think some of the
turntables- Well, you know what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you right now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's- There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I didn't tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally fucking- Well, you did just now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's- That's the absolute difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar leaf and bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty substantial difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Night and day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: In dry sift, anyway, I find that there's
some sort of a- hayish plant matter
[SPEAKER_03]: cellulose taste that is passed on and I've
even seen it in water hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain it to me so they can do it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you get that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you acquire- How you know it's either
from bud or from the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be the difference- The easiest
way to tell would be to put a bag of leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: into a- You know, put a bunch of leaf into
a little bag and put a bunch of bud into a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bag and just open those after an
hour of them off-gassing and sitting in
[SPEAKER_03]: the bag or jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And open them and smell each one and one
will smell like hay, which will be the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just chlorophyll or whatever it is
that's present more in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in a lesser- It's in a higher
concentration than resin glands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas bud is just so stacked with resin
glands that you can get the nice smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it's nothing compared to when
you extract just the heads and then that
[SPEAKER_03]: smell is like just the pure essence.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like off the bud, it's just unbelievably
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell, taste, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buzz is still killer from the sugar
leaf and this trash turns into your stash
[SPEAKER_01]: quite easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still fucking melty and killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, melted into a liquid for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coconut oil infused with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love eating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I woke up with mine this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice flavors and just an amazing
smorgasbord of even though it's all OG so
[SPEAKER_03]: far, there's been nuances and differences
in the different size heads from the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profiles and the cannabinoid
profiles and then hitting three bud and
[SPEAKER_03]: then going to a leaf and then going back
to a bud, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm absolutely blasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy because- We've got one,
two, three, four, five, six more to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what we can do here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mark that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the one I just hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I just hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then yeah, getting out of here
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to seeing the crew in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking forward to seeing Tony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be- I'm sorry that I missed
the conference that was just there
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really tried to make it out but my
schedule was just not allowing me to leave
[SPEAKER_03]: for that period of time so tomorrow was as
early as I could get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strong, such a bite in the lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That keeps you from really talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the head space of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really like intense in the head,
like super body numbing in the sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: like any pain or discomfort you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely gone in the high of this
strain, which obviously people know OG is
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely medicinal for sort of pain
relief and that sort of nerve damage and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a lot of people say OG has been
the one for them or any variety of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to list a couple of here and I'm
going to let you take a pick of which ones
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to try here next.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's called HS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it Holy Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's basically a mixture of some
bags that I've got some of my bros with
[SPEAKER_01]: their medical licenses and their groceries
that bring me some of their leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: their sugar leaf and I forget what it's
called, that sort of stuff and it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: few bags of swag that's killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always call it a lucky day profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I call her Holy Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got the Holy Grail Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: More Holies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look this hash is holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Goji OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it should be Holy Goji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy fucking Goji.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be Holy question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got the Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one where once you hit it,
every other hit tastes like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got some 70 micron of I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question mark again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Diesel is a dominating flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Astro Boy, it didn't matter what we
smoked after the Astro Boy hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: still tastes like Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Diesel will be the same way because
it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we'll take these two out because
we know the names of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Holy Grail and the Goji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Goji down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goji, Golgi, apparatus for all your fish
heads out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are carded and from sugar leaf
as well, not the bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can't tell you the last time I sat
down and just hit like 10 different full
[SPEAKER_03]: melt dry sips.
Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a Legends of Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have a Legends in Canada ever,
I'd definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to enter a competition or try it
out just because.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you answer out of all of these
that you brought?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you enter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel and Oji.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would enter too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's other strains we're
working with that hands down I would enter
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put in some entries and if I was
to know that I was doing this within a
[SPEAKER_01]: year or something like that, a year in
advance, I would make some of the utmost,
[SPEAKER_01]: purest, prettiest hash that I could ever
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would put it away until then and I
would open it maybe three times to let a
[SPEAKER_01]: gas off and then seal it up again until
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would just be, it would be
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: A beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something fucking right from right from
love, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I could say, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be the best way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't come from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love making the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sifting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a person that has no patience for a
lot of different things and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: High, strong, fucking crazy son of a gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this I have patience for all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a very nice taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grabbed me for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got me a good head buzz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just still taste that difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between the bud and the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a difference, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you definitely want to be bringing
sift made from bud to legends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, there would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so smooth and like, the difference
might be subtle to some, but it's massive
[SPEAKER_03]: to others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to the judges of those types of
competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff wouldn't even be, the leaf,
even though pure and good, everything it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, and the microscope, everything,
still different than the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody had a lesser quality bud
from bud, it would win over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those guys would be on it all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly Salmon and Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I would add to the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not even waste the judges time
with sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would keep that for myself and my medals
and smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's got me coughing for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not just a terping cough,
but that little bit of that difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that taste and smell is from the
leaf to the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird because I really rarely got
that in, like that it seemed to wash off
[SPEAKER_03]: in water because I remember running
batches of water hash from sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean real sugar leaf, real trim,
no fan leaf at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came out spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as nice as the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I ran the same bud before as well
and just thought, oh, this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: even be nicer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were kind of like, okay,
it's still a 9.5 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just thinking it was going to be a
15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my golly doodle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy grail, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: The holy grail coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the coosh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got any of that coosh?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I say it like that is
because Bill Clinton in the movie
[SPEAKER_01]: Pineapple Express.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's talking to Seth Rogen, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not Seth Rogen, Seth... Oh,
I think I now remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: He whispers over something and says
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the OG or this is the something
coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't say coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the holy grail coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the coosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys need some coosh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made out of really good sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a batch that was made with sugar
leaf and with bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be the one with bud because it
looks really nice and it smells really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just have to see once we smoke it
because we'll be able to tell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm leaning more towards the line of it's
from the bud, just from the look of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I need for the herb iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it needs that, it's not clean enough
and I need to clean it some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's whited out and you got to heat it
up a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the whiting out, what's the bad parts
of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a bad part to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have stuff that seems to be
whited out and it still melts beautifully
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoked killer and I get just ripped
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad part is the longer you let it go
that it's, okay, here's the bad part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it tested and see what is making it
whited out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just terpenes and it's natural,
then probably nothing's going to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: If water is present, then mold can occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a mold in there and that's kind
of like, from my perspective, the older
[SPEAKER_03]: guys, every time they ever have seen it,
it's to them, told them, water hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't been dried properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally because that's what it was back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we start seeing it with some dry
sifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because the terpenes ... It's too
fresh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was done in the ice cold so the resin
heads were frozen nice and fresh like that
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put together so that moisture is
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, we don't know until we get a lab
and we start testing these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all just a bunch of people sitting
around and theorizing about, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's this and I think it's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all cool ideas and concepts and
thoughts, but none of them are based on
[SPEAKER_03]: reality as much as based on our
assumptions of reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fact in any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there is fact behind it and someone
out there knows about it, send us the
[SPEAKER_01]: link.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to learn more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be about smoking fucking dope
and all that kind of stuff and the world
[SPEAKER_01]: is taking it in such a greater picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just ... It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hit that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitting the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm definitely the highest I've ever
been the day before I'm flying out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I've never left right after a
Legends because that would be crazy to try
[SPEAKER_03]: and wake up the next day after a Legends,
which is literally like what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_03]: right here, except with 27 to 35 hits all
in a row, all in a very short period of
[SPEAKER_03]: time, probably the length of this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-stop, just bang, bang, bang,
bang.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really only a few people that can
sit at the table and get that done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, you start sweating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start kind of like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to pace yourself too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice I'm not taking my regular
sized monster ... Well, I don't take
[SPEAKER_03]: monster dabs, but I do take dabs that are
much bigger than I normally take,
[SPEAKER_03]: than I'm taking right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still got four to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that one for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: One to the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are looking great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got them all nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll start the next row right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do three rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your time, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren's just taking full size.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest rip that he can take.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh fuck, okay, I can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these weird edits in the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren fell down again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This video actually took 14 hours to film.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just cut it down to 49 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the most enjoyable hit off of all
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you, it was strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the pins and needles in my ... My
whole head tangled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen the little stars fucking doing the
loops and then fucking had to hold my head
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love rips like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got four more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth one, the diesel, I'm almost
fucking scared about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to that one because
it's so much flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You love the flavor more, but I love the
flavor too, but the power from it really
[SPEAKER_01]: surprises me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It bites me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, maybe the turps get me high
on it, higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could be modulating the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're smoking 10 rips of OG before you
hit the diesel, that could definitely ...
[SPEAKER_03]: Tone it down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just give you a really good high on
your diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, this diesel is super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, when I say that, I've never
considered Calio, the diesel, some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy, some of these strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never thought of them as the most
powerfully strong strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it came from bud or leaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could have come from leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took the first smell and I smelt leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you were like, it smells pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I took another smell and it smelt
more smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got a nice amberish,
reddish color.
[SPEAKER_01]: That holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I believe, is from bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 70 ... Yeah, I don't smell any
leaf on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 70 question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The what the fuck, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to have a nap before I
leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I've got so much shit to do today
that I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I'm napping, please keep it
down, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find a corner somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreo!
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_03]: Tough guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he isn't here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, if he hasn't come by
now, he might not be in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, get up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough guy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the toughest little doggie I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pretty tough dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreo's been ... He's probably not even
allowed up at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's being bad right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been attacked by raccoons.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been taken by a coyote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taken to go eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Survived them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: A raccoon tried to eat him, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a multitude of raccoons,
actually, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they fucking can't beat him,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pierced his throat 15 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feel it when you rub his throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of got these ripples in his ...
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where he got mangled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how hardcore that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's had his throat mangled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's worse than a fucking outright
gang prison week.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been hit by a car, which is like,
well, like getting hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that feels like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a little fucking eight pound dog
that got hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's so tough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He impresses the hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then taken, the equivalent of what
would be the equivalent of having a
[SPEAKER_03]: multitude of dudes in balaclavas pull up
next to you in a van and put a bag over
[SPEAKER_03]: your head and pull you into the van.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then stab you and beat him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he was just in the mouth and it was
shaking him a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they weren't quite ... And he's got a
titanium hip and it's mounted on both
[SPEAKER_03]: sides, goes right through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it had its teeth on his
titanium and he couldn't really sink in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he ended up dropping ... Lucky for that
titanium, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's unbelievable, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky for that car hitting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything happens for a reason,
eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow, some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they say, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreo cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tough guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doggies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to keep it around just in case,
you know, zombie apocalypse and you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: eat them to survive or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the first ones to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might be breakfast for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat little sausages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have a real nice taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that it's very likely that
that came from Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you hit it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're hitting everything after me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much smoother, delayed cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be from the Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it is, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bunch of the bottoms of the bags of
Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely feel that throughout.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, after taking this many hits,
people are going, how can you tell if it's
...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, listen, you can tell,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go wash my hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: This level of quality, every time you hit
it, you are going to feel an increase and
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially a change in your high,
especially if you're hitting different
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the strain, Darren?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 70 micron question mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what the strain is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different from the other things
that he has here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a collection of a multitude of
strains because it had a very complex
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Musky and cushy, but something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some of these other OG or Goji or
maybe some diesel or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that's changing the profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Darren's just washing his hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll hit the next one while he's
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: HS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: License pardon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, there's a lucky day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't want to get any of those
doggy oils off my fingers into my pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're precious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Into my pressed piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going in the bowl soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has just been a great session.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 70?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we just hit eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren's hitting his eighth rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just finished mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number nine is about to go down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to hit the question mark
and finish it off with the New York City
[SPEAKER_03]: Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super orange citrus flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not just limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's valencine, mercine, oleopine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a variety of terpenes in that
orange that makes it that orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it's the difference between if
you know what orange oil is versus
[SPEAKER_03]: D-limonene, the one single terpene
extracted from orange rinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Google.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference is orange oil is
stacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full of mono, sesquo, and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horatio does that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: He does the D-limonene, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had his product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel it instantly right from your head
to your toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just like a blanket going over you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not unlike the Stri-Sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the first time I hit Horatio's
oil, I've only hit a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've hit his oil just maybe three times
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first time I hit it, he was like,
okay, you got to hit it like he was
[SPEAKER_03]: directing me how I should hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, okay, it's his oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his vape.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got it all low-temp out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, it's going to be about a
30-second hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, I won't suck too hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go real slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I started hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was like, oh, I want you to
hold it in for about 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hold it in and then blow it out real
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So real slowly while I do this,
of course, I'm ripped instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get a message from my wife that I
have to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, whoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel it right down to your toes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was completely, you know,
very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like I am right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean and, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean is important if you're inhaling it
into your lungs and your body and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to use it for medication and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important even if you're just
recreational or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all deserve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it seems to be like, because I'm
not trying to be an elitist or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really feel that everyone deserves
the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all deserve this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Level of quality they deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve to be able to grow the best,
their own self in the backyard and a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse to make enough to make
medication throughout the winter time and
[SPEAKER_01]: their oils and their tinctures and their
anger, their medibles and everything just
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep themselves active with it and
keeping their endocannabinoid systems fed
[SPEAKER_01]: and keeping healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be happening at one time at one
point in the world, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting one point one time again,
we're getting closer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was sharp on the throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the from leaf.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, but sharp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of all of the, in fact, the sharpest
by far out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know if you, if you see that or if
that's just a unique thing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be after the ninth hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ninth hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really felt like, cause I was taking the
hit and I was like halfway through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as I got about three quarters of
the way through, I felt it before I
[SPEAKER_03]: exhaled it and I didn't feel any of that
with these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a single, so I don't know if it's my
own sensitive throat after nine rips,
[SPEAKER_03]: like he said, or if it's, if he's going to
be feeling a little bit of a sharper rip
[SPEAKER_03]: on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you do become an elitist when
you just get this many beautiful strains
[SPEAKER_03]: put in front of you in the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have this many.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find one that's shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another way of saying it is they can't all
be the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when some of these like four or
five of them are just outstanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like made from bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the color is lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is danker.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hit is harder and stronger and
tastier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get it when you were taking the
hit or not until after taking it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then there's definitely something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's made out of leaf too,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but there you have other leaf ones
that didn't give me that sharp of a rip
[SPEAKER_01]: because of anything, a million variables,
the size of the heads, the screen size,
[SPEAKER_03]: the contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that might've gotten in there
that we're feeling that shouldn't be in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you never know, but I know that there
wouldn't be anything like spray on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of nutrient spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's neem oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would taste right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can hide that.
[SPEAKER_03]: From me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in it sprayed on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't taste anything in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just sharp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really just want to hit that diesel,
but let's hit this surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be the oldest stuff to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The driest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, this is a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes when you evaporate terpenes,
we were talking about this earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can lose harsh ones in the curing
process and release really beautiful ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it does work the other way around
where sometimes you lose your terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: that were smooth and now you're left with
these harsh ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's just a matter of us
learning which terpenes are those.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that degradation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it light?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, you know, what, how are we getting
to these end results?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see the differences in all the
hashes and there's subtle, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: color differences and, and flavor and
taste profiles, even in the same strain
[SPEAKER_03]: separated out into the separate screens,
which people ask me all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have separate size?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have four size screens in the
wood and then only end, but different four
[SPEAKER_03]: size screens in the metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, because the four screens
are for separating heads, you're never
[SPEAKER_03]: going to like, there's a cleaning screen
in that kit too, but really that kit
[SPEAKER_03]: should be a three screen kit that comes
with the metal framed larger kit,
[SPEAKER_03]: because those are just to prepare you to
take that resin and then go over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And try and tune it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, drop it through the two
screens, you know, card it with parchment
[SPEAKER_03]: over the 70 and then man, I'll tell you at
the end of the day, you're pretty darn
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Question mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm going to hit some what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm most excited about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the tastiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the most, like to me, this diesel,
the diesel is to you like the Astro Boy is
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I hit that Astro Boy,
it was just like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost makes you want to get up and
start running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Astro Boy definitely has that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's C99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zasitiva.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question mark?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty darn flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be blowing parchments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little tiny bit sharp, but I think that
might be because I just took 10 rips and
[SPEAKER_03]: then got sharpened by this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm excited for the diesel because I
know exactly what that's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what we should do?
[SPEAKER_03]: We should put the silicone carbide nail in
and do all of these again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part two coming soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that's such a funny fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hit this bitch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you hit that one because that's the
only thing keeping us from Mr. I can't be
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking wimping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking on a hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not wimping out, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking championed out on all these
rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't even do this at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just we didn't even plan to really do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like we weren't thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, yeah, we're just going to sit
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go through all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there were five or six in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't count them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That diesel's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a diesel, eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a 70 question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if it's a 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's just the what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what size screen it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's totally what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, it's putrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Putrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, holy fuck, does that thing reek like
a baby diaper almost when I smelt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could taste the lemon as I was inhaling
for a cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck is, you know, smiling like that
after a talk hurts my lungs just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: toe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to enjoy that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no one's going to send it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have an outright fucking
dual panic attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finishing it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just like, I'll see you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just see me walking down the
stairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Christ, you're falling down the
stairs.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stanley Stanley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our shout out to Stanley.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Stan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all your great equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all your fucking goods,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lunch kits and clothing and work gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stanley's the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would normally blow that out,
but not in such presence of so much open
drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I just don't want to see black bits
of carbon fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it would be contaminating them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't be contaminating the hash after it
takes fucking hours to decontaminate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Months to fucking grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a while before you harvest the
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you really, if you
really want to harvest the heads in the
[SPEAKER_01]: most proper ways, you dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in your best, you know, if everybody
has their temperatures and their methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been I've been told a method
just recently that I want to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a 14 day cure at 56 degrees
hanging on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimmed up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hanging on the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all just the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_03]: telling you about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually, my buddy Jake, somebody told
him that down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: David Allen was talking about that a
little while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: A while back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And John really was like receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it really harvests the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went I went and visited a fairly big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here's the heads, I guess,
before the harvest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went into their cure room and it was
very cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold enough not to preserve the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 57 degrees, 58 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mold spores starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have it like that, then you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have that process happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take it down to 56,
55 and don't have those those mold spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preservation of the terpenes, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You walk into the room and it smells,
but it doesn't smell like what you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take that and harvest into
your into your your own butt into your
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't take it off that the 14 days
and then harvest it because the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: would be too fucking soft and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would then have to be dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a completely dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: No humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low humidity, low temperature still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just let it do its thing for maybe a
month or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you even move those things off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you want those glands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those gland heads, we want them to raisin
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they don't want them as these
giant water balloons with perfect edges
[SPEAKER_03]: around the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why too.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm doing my parchment paper part
that that I learned from from the
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment paper or even the iTunes card,
when you're doing it and it's and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fresher and it's not cold enough,
you're going to just smear heads and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all up on your card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get a complete,
easy, complete surface on going across.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have all these beads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I've talked about in my videos of
how important it is to clean that card.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's doing that, that your your
situation is that you're not cold enough
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're heating it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much by being too fast,
too hard on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm telling you, if you get it
cold enough, you can beat it up pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like cold enough is like in the minus
degrees, not like 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it up there in my shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in Whistler's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blowing steam out of my breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if it can be minus 10 or minus 15 or
minus 20, like guaranteed, you will see
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in those temperatures in the
way the resin gland reacts to being
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the super cold weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a super mild winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we've had a super mild winter,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now it's in the pluses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had maybe a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were dressed up pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a week for some really cold,
a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been in the pluses and in the low
minuses when January, January it's
[SPEAKER_01]: raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Winter Olympics are happening
up there this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next month starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canada Games?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's been raining and it's just
the worst winter I've seen in Prince
[SPEAKER_01]: George.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's rough up here, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the snow, even if you look across the
mountains, there's like no snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and there's a little bit over on the
back glaciers here, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, is that a lot of rock face compared
to what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, now we are baked on 10
rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darren's going to finish it off with a New
York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is number 11 for Darren.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did my 11th.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was absolutely spectacular tasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that you guys tried to do the D420K
Bubble Man Gauntlet, a dry sift gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't expect you to have a D-mail or a
mothership, whatever kind of pipe or way
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got to smoke it, we accept.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we throw this gauntlet down to all of
you that are watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: 11 rips in whatever the time of this video
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Won't you please try?
[SPEAKER_01]: And stay conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not done yet, so I could fall down.
[SPEAKER_03]: D's going to take us out with a rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching Bubble Man's World.
Thanks for watching.
