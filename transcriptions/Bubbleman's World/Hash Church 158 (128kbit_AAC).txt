[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Hash Church episode 158.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we miss an episode of Hash Church here
recently?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it feels like we might have missed
the first ever Hash Church episode last
[SPEAKER_06]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was camping.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming back from camping, I even tried to
make it happen more.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to apologize to everyone for
missing our first episode, but we're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're rocking.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a Sunday show for you here set
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am going to send out the link to the
panelists and we'll see what they are up
[SPEAKER_06]: to today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I had an email open up here
somewhere, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't I have an email set up to all my
friends?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I closed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Closed it like the fool that I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will send out that link again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everyone's doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to actually say happy birthday to
my good friend Bingo Lombardi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by good friend, I mean a random dude
that I talk to a lot in a chat room.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been a supporter of the Wake and Bake
shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been a supporter of the Hash
Churches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's in chat right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I figure the best thing for us to do
is maybe puff a little bowl for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty good, Mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got like Jerry Garcia and like a
little Wook.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a little Wook there?
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a little Wookie here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got back from being on Fish Tour.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Swinging glass and nitrous out in the lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_12]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Selling Jerry Garcia bootlegs from 78.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little Merle Saunders.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, he's just he's swinging some glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's trying to make it back out to the
West Coast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's swinging glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, glass hasher ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody rides for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's what they said on the
bumper sticker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how you been there, Mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Missed you a couple of weeks there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, doing well.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to say happy birthday to our
friend Bingo, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy birthday, Bingo.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, things are going well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to take I'm going to take
a bong rip for Bingo while we wait for the
[SPEAKER_06]: rest of the crew to to make an appearance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Fish, of course, have announced that
they're playing four shows at the end of
[SPEAKER_12]: the year in Madison Square Garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that means they'll have done seven
shows in Madison Square Garden in 2017.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to get some tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you say about tickets?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I tried to buy some tickets for the
for for a four day run at Madison Square
[SPEAKER_06]: Garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured, you know, I I just want to be a
part of this in some some way or shape or
[SPEAKER_06]: another, even if I got to buy some tickets
and give them away on my show.
[SPEAKER_06]: How fun will that be?
[SPEAKER_06]: For Madison Square Garden, I figured,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going, Peter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Long time no see, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if I got to buy some tickets and give
them away on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you got to you got to mute the YouTube
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Madison Square Garden, I figured,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is the classic guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even to even today after one hundred and
fifty eight times, I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, I got to mute the YouTube video or my
voice will start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super sorry that I missed the three
year I had strep throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, my kids got me all fucked up with the
organs, the microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I thought you were like MIA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just like, damn, Peter used to show
up and now he's just like MIA must be
[SPEAKER_06]: busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love coming and hanging with you and
having a Sunday hash hash joint just in
[SPEAKER_01]: honor of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down to I'm down to have a little
puff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make it in honor of Bingo Lombardi,
though, because it's his birthday.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's his birthday today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, shit, he's always in the chat
room.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just know that it makes him happy
every time we mention his name,
[SPEAKER_06]: every time we say happy birthday,
Bingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's puff a bowl for Bingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, Bingo.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's just one of those zany cast of
characters that sits in chat waiting for
[SPEAKER_12]: church every week.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I tell you, Marcus, I was like in that
group of people who were really worried
[SPEAKER_12]: about your safety, because when we didn't
see an episode go up for there to have a
[SPEAKER_12]: chat last Sunday, everyone started
wondering, you know, is there going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: an episode?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I immediately was like, oh,
I hope Marcus is OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope he didn't like, you know,
drive off of some ravine somewhere,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, isn't stuck somewhere in
communicato because it's very unlike you
[SPEAKER_12]: to have the episode already up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as soon as the episode's up
there, people start gathering and start
[SPEAKER_12]: having chat dialogue.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is that's where Bingo is like one
of the, you know, one of the cast of
[SPEAKER_12]: characters that's in that chat every week
with all kinds of interesting stuff to add
[SPEAKER_12]: and say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, no, it was kind of crazy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I ended up camping.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up out away from anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'm not going to be there
for the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Natasha was like, I'm going to be in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't really have anyone
that I can get to even run this show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I woke up Sunday morning and I was
camping with no Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't know how to pull
this off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just I don't know how to pull this off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a bong rip for Hash Church for
missing Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for everyone that thought I was
dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess when you're consistent in this
world and you miss something, people are
[SPEAKER_06]: really thrown off by that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not quite true because Natasha
was here in Amsterdam and she was partying
[SPEAKER_10]: with me and she didn't even remember you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, how soon we're forgotten.
[SPEAKER_06]: How soon we are forgotten.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the Catholic Church, if you miss a
week, you miss a session at church.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it falls into that bucket of
venial sins.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know the difference between venial
and mortal sins.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you have to go to a confession
booth to get down on your knees and pray
[SPEAKER_12]: that you missed an episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we should all take a knee and
pray for forgiveness, I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: During the American anthem, you know,
I even tried to come home that night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to set up an evening sermon I
thought would be a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my wife had been dealing with our kids
for four days straight by herself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just not the right thing to do
to come home and ignore her and the kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And go right into another show when really
I needed to pay attention to my children
[SPEAKER_06]: and I needed to pay attention to my wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I chose my family last Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I hope that you guys can all
forgive me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do apologize for not giving anyone a
heads up whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes that's the way it goes in
the world of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: We chose wisely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going, D420K?
[SPEAKER_13]: Motherlobber.
[SPEAKER_13]: Motherlobbers.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's everybody today on this final show?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it a fine fall weekend?
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody eating turkey dinners tonight
and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or both?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Only in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's in November in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do it in November, which is why the
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam was always on
[SPEAKER_06]: November Thanksgiving weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I must have done 20 fucking Thanksgiving,
U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanksgivings in Amsterdam over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it was always nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you ever saw Sam,
but Doug would always buy Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_06]: meal for for, you know, the hoodlum guys,
the hemp works and the sort of bubble crew
[SPEAKER_06]: as we were all kind of one at our booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we used to do the old the Thanksgiving
dinners in in in Amsterdam for the
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife used to bake a big giant fat
turkey almost every Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of this outdoor?
[SPEAKER_14]: Check, check, check, check, check,
check, check.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys see this outdoor?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks respectable.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess how much this outdoor is here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: Five hundred and fifty one dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five hundred and fifty one dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: The price is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get on up here, Tony.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Canadian dollars.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's about nine dollars and fifty
three cents American.
[SPEAKER_06]: Per pound of this herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six hundred Canadian dollars, probably
four hundred to four hundred and fifty U
[SPEAKER_06]: .S.
[SPEAKER_06]: dollars for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously, they got you to buy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't buy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just give me buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say, take these buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need like a little pussy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam just outed me on his charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a pussy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just called me a pussy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for laughing that way,
D.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly how we needed to finish
that particular.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pussy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a good laugh out of that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a belly roller.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just like Sam's going hard as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, you know, Sam, have you even
wished Bingo Lombardi a happy birthday
[SPEAKER_06]: yet?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but I'll sing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday to you, Mr. President,
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what you don't know right now,
Bingo, is that Sam is wearing the most
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful Marilyn Monroe dress while
singing that particular song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, welcome, Wade from the House of
Laughter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are in the Church of Laughter right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're belly rolling over here this
morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad your Internet's working and
somehow the clouds cleared and you're able
[SPEAKER_06]: to visit us on this beautiful fall
afternoon somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not here yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nine in the morning, but somewhere
it's afternoon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: It started getting cold.
[SPEAKER_11]: The flowers are filling in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really grateful today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still a lack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still a lack of precipitation down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a light sprinkling of rain.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we've had weeks ago,
but that's about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I saw, Wade?
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw in the news that the grape growers
up in Northern California, it's been so
[SPEAKER_10]: hot and dry recently that the grapes are
all withering up and they're having a real
[SPEAKER_10]: problem with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know about the vineyards,
but we have some wine grapes here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't really make wine with them,
but they're turning into raisins on the
[SPEAKER_11]: vine.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I saw in the videos.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were harvesting it and they had
machines that were trying to set the real
[SPEAKER_10]: grapes from the raisins.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a hot, dry summer in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_11]: After all that beautiful rain,
we had this last winter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's been great for BC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all the people I know that have
plants in the ground still.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, lots of people have harvested
already.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just been months of beating hot sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, anyone that grows in the
Pacific Northwest knows well that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of a throw of the dice, whether or
not the incredible rain, basically powdery
[SPEAKER_06]: mildew just is like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, BC?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like people that have beautiful
plants just get decimated so quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people are happy right now
just with this endless, endless sun that
[SPEAKER_06]: we've been getting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty damn sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel grateful.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really been beautiful weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, man, I was camping last weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Went camping the whole weekend and it
never rained, which really like,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not like I hate the rain,
but it's just like fall in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_06]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it starts raining, it gets cold and
kind of miserable quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can really come in and destroy things
quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to share a funny story about
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: This past week on Tuesday morning about
430, one of my dogs was making all kinds
[SPEAKER_11]: of noise in the middle of the night and
there was extra noises involved and put on
[SPEAKER_11]: some clothes and grabbed a flashlight,
went out to see what was going on and a
[SPEAKER_11]: fairly good sized raccoon had taken one of
my dogs into the pond.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had seen earlier in my life,
I saw a dog get drowned by a raccoon.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't my dog, but I saw it and it was
horrific.
[SPEAKER_11]: This raccoon was climbing up on the head
of one of my dogs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here to testify to a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_11]: One, it's a really terrible idea to go
into a pond to try and separate dogs and
[SPEAKER_11]: raccoons because you can get tore up.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second thing I'm here to testify about
is cannabis creams, creams that are
[SPEAKER_11]: formulated for pain relief, really have
remarkable antibiotic and anti-fungal
[SPEAKER_11]: properties.
[SPEAKER_11]: The wounds on my hands are healing up
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a little experiment a couple of days
ago where one of my hands, I slathered in
[SPEAKER_11]: a cream that we make and the other hand,
I left it alone because there were so many
[SPEAKER_11]: bandages.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I showed it to my doctor and he knows
what I do and we've talked a lot about it,
[SPEAKER_11]: but he can't recommend anything,
of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked him, can you tell which hand I've
treated with cannabis since this happened?
[SPEAKER_11]: He took one look and he said, oh yeah,
that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, you're right because all of the
wounds, all the inflammation and redness
[SPEAKER_11]: around all these bite marks had
disappeared on the hand that I was using
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis on and were still pretty angry
and inflamed on the hand that I hadn't
[SPEAKER_11]: used it on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a little testimony about taking care
of your body.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your positivity.
[SPEAKER_06]: You come in to tell us you got attacked by
a raccoon and instead of being like,
[SPEAKER_06]: man, I had a rough couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, the wounds on my hands are
healing beautifully.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really a true story.
[SPEAKER_13]: You saved your dog.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good fucking job, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I guess the moral of that story is
if you're going to wrestle raccoons,
[SPEAKER_15]: have some cannabis cream on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a flat brimmed shovel.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a couple of coon dogs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, raccoons have opposable thumbs,
so they don't really fuck around.
[SPEAKER_11]: I grabbed a hole to him and he grabbed a
hole to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what's scary.
[SPEAKER_15]: They got those claws.
[SPEAKER_15]: They got those claws that go down.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, he went all the way down my
wrists and tore up both hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had about five of them jump my dog in
the backyard and they punctured his throat
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 times.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had 15 little holes in his trachea and
so he survived it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He survived that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He survived getting run over by a car.
[SPEAKER_06]: He survived getting attacked by coyotes.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dog's tough as shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Your dog's been run over a couple times.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, only once by a car.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he got run over by a little boy when
he was a puppy on a bicycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it all started.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all started with him getting run over
by this bike and then he started hating
[SPEAKER_06]: things on wheels and he'd be attracted to
them no matter how hard I tried to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: them away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like break free and then go fuck with
cars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go bark at cars.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I have the invisible fence and he
can't go anywhere and he's alive and
[SPEAKER_06]: healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So take care of your pets out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially living in nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not even bears.
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine if the bear just came down and
just gobbled my dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like raccoons and people and coyotes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an endless... They are no joke,
John Vidal.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are no joke.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are in their land.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've only been here a short time.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been here forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention, we're just like... They
can live in the land and survive and
[SPEAKER_06]: unless we have a lot of things to take
care of, we tend to perish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we need to store food and have fire
and like have a place... And don't forget
[SPEAKER_06]: the internet connection.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget Wi-Fi internet connection
so we can Skype late night bong rips with
[SPEAKER_06]: my good friend Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a funny episode of Hash Church today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel good about it myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's because I've eaten a pack of
these gummy bears from the canadies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just gobbling down a little bit of
their stuff and puffing on some MK Ultra
[SPEAKER_06]: that I pressed last night.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you announce that this was a farewell
episode?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't necessarily announce that
it was a farewell episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of felt like I felt a couple
of times with church.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I love the gatherings,
it's sometimes overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anyone can understand what
I went through to miss the first episode
[SPEAKER_06]: in three years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was literally having nervous breakdown
stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my wife was just kind of like,
is it supposed to be about stress?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like it's kind of turned
into a stressful thing that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: responsible for these people that you
don't even know, but you want to give them
[SPEAKER_06]: this information that you're not sure that
they even already don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's just like, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've been thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say necessarily that it's the
end of Hash Church, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: like sort of a change in a sense,
maybe some form of a- Well, when I asked
[SPEAKER_15]: you about it, it was interesting because I
kept missing a lot more this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to do a reflection today.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like a farewell.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe there'll be more, but I think that
we should reflect today because- No,
[SPEAKER_10]: no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have to worry because I was about
cannabis cathedral.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am now the pope of pot.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think what he's saying is that
there's a lot of responsibility that falls
[SPEAKER_15]: upon an individual at nine in the morning
on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_15]: I myself am surprised it went 16 plus
episodes because if I had it with the wife
[SPEAKER_15]: and kids and it was Sunday morning and it
was nine o'clock in the morning,
[SPEAKER_15]: oh, I would never hear the end of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I commend you the fact that you
pioneered through the wife and kids for
[SPEAKER_15]: how many episodes?
[SPEAKER_15]: 158.
[SPEAKER_15]: You gave up 158 Sunday mornings to spread
information.
[SPEAKER_15]: In a row, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas morning while my two kids were
opening presents in the other room.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, 158 in a row where all the rest of
the panelists and the rest of us,
[SPEAKER_15]: oh, we'll chime in.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll come in.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll come and go.
[SPEAKER_15]: But like my hat's off to you.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like you went, it's a strong
run, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, and a tremendous amount of
information that has gotten out to the
[SPEAKER_15]: community, the industry, the panelists
that are here and the panelists that have
[SPEAKER_15]: come through.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's a wealth of information over
158 episodes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think there's been some pivotal
points in some of the conversations and
[SPEAKER_15]: how it popularized different movements and
also for all the patients that have come
[SPEAKER_15]: on and told their stories.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the things we've raised attention
to.
[SPEAKER_15]: When this thing first started,
I remember we were talking about like the
[SPEAKER_15]: whole BHO craze because there wasn't a
huge solvent list movement.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's how kind of we started talking
with Johnny B and Horatio and the core of
[SPEAKER_15]: us, we were saying, man, you know,
this whole, you know, BHOs taken off,
[SPEAKER_15]: live resins taken off.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was like this whole movement.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was a fear that full melt or
sift was just going to vanish into thin
[SPEAKER_15]: air.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was a little light there.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like, well, there's got to be,
there's got to be another way to create a
[SPEAKER_15]: solventless extract that can be
popularized and thus flower rosin and hash
[SPEAKER_15]: rosin and everything that followed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one that changed my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both 25 and 30 were powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, yeah, we can hear you,
Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think also 30 was a very powerful
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was 30 where Jessica Hawkins
came on and told us about her daughter,
[SPEAKER_06]: Naya.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, does that sound right to you guys
that it was episode 30?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we all cried on that episode,
didn't we?
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody, everybody out there in the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you didn't have a soul.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a lot of people like that tune in,
you know, for the first time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or even today or whatever they don't,
they just see a bunch of guys coming
[SPEAKER_15]: together, smoking a whole bunch of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would I would say this, that like
it's not I don't do this every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't wake up and puff as hard as I can
to get my day started.
[SPEAKER_15]: This was the this was our religion.
[SPEAKER_15]: This was like the once a once a week.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're like, well, that's how Sunday
started.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, well, I really love to wake up and
smoke the different products that I have.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's different stuff that I've gotten
from people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was like how it started.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was, you know, we were smoking whatever
solventless extracts we had and shooting a
[SPEAKER_15]: shit and then talking about information
and how we smoke religiously every
[SPEAKER_10]: morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you're retired.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not even joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not even joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is not even joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I had that kind of it's he's he's
he's a religious atheist person.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, when you get up in the morning,
it's the first thing I do every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: First thing I do is like, I mean,
I do, too, but I don't hit 60 dabs in a
[SPEAKER_15]: row.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you know, like that's what people
like.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember how people forgot around episode
100?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, why is that guy hitting dab after
dab after dab?
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a car.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that's what we're supposed to
do.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're supposed to hit it as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there was episodes where no one
smoked anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was the only guy puffing in the
background.
[SPEAKER_15]: For real.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was episodes there where their
conversations were so deep that nobody
[SPEAKER_15]: even smoked once.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Smoked.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's I got a smoke right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's bong rip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a real one, Darren.
[SPEAKER_10]: We each have to do one hundred and fifty
eight right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm not going to say no.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it a try.
[SPEAKER_13]: Better get busy.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like the 18 terp dip gauntlet we
did there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, actually, what I really wanted to
talk about was the most viewed hash church
[SPEAKER_06]: episode by almost like four to five times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is, in my opinion, episode 33.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the hash church that D420K
interviewed Jake's wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was her name again now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Gailene.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to say Gailene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gailene.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that is the most one of the most
watched episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only a three hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's one hundred and nine
thousand people have watched that episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, she still eats a copious
amount of oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: I made her a batch just last week of the
locomotion.
[SPEAKER_13]: She does.
[SPEAKER_13]: She likes the best.
[SPEAKER_13]: She takes a teaspoon or a tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_13]: She eats as much that would knock any of
us on our fucking ass every day,
[SPEAKER_13]: twice a day, morning and night.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she's one hundred pounds, maybe ninety
seven pounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tiny little lady.
[SPEAKER_13]: She is part on set of Parkinson's and she
gets up and she's shaky and she's a
[SPEAKER_13]: typical human being that gets up in the
morning and looks after her dogs,
[SPEAKER_13]: looks after kids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's grown up, everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And herself laughs if she would get on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's starting now to look after herself
first.
[SPEAKER_13]: Take that dose.
[SPEAKER_13]: A huge bong rip of locomotion rosin,
huge teaspoon of the locomotion,
[SPEAKER_13]: coconut butter.
[SPEAKER_13]: And she fucking rocks all day.
[SPEAKER_13]: She doesn't say it gets her high.
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes her normal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes her like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is not shaky.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of how I feel when I smoke lots.
[SPEAKER_17]: It just makes me normal.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's what I think about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: It gives me that balance that I need every
day.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's the reason why a lot of
us use it is it's because it balances and
[SPEAKER_17]: makes us normal.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I broke my back and my neck and every
morning I get up, my back fucking hurts,
[SPEAKER_13]: man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_13]: One rip and it helps me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes it right away.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I'm
like, oh shit, my pain's gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking right on.
[SPEAKER_13]: On with my day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to feel bad when you feel good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see Mark Scaldone's little Jerry
bear?
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that little thing there for a
second?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a little Jerry Garcia with a
look.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Chewbacca.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chewbacca was selling glass, flipping
glass on tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the cops took his kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the whole story, but it
wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish we all had our own little
individual stuffed animal that we like
[SPEAKER_15]: resembled something.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did this whole Hash Church thing
for 158 episodes through Puppet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Sam?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Sam showed his chin one time and
people were like, started a thread about
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wearing the mask, but don't tell
anybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all part of the thread.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I remember there was a time when
my mother had gone through a divorce and
[SPEAKER_15]: she was living with me for a little while.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was listening to your voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: She was like, who's this Mr. Bubble Man?
[SPEAKER_15]: What a pleasant voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: So much information.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, what's this going on every
Sunday Hash Church?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because she was just like trying to figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: And one time she like tuned in secretly on
the computer when she was listening and
[SPEAKER_15]: she was like, you know, I get all the
information that's being spread.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she's just an outsider looking in and
she's like, what's up with the little,
[SPEAKER_15]: what's up with Dr. Seuss?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, oh, who's Dr. Seuss?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then she's like, yeah, the,
you know, the little stuffed animal.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, what do you, I was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: The guy was, she's like, why, why is there
a stuffed animal talking all this
[SPEAKER_15]: information?
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, why is there never a human
there?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, oh, well that person
doesn't want to be known.
[SPEAKER_15]: And she's like, oh, it's so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like all in tune to this little Dr.
Seuss puppet and all this information's
[SPEAKER_15]: coming out of a little puppet.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like so funny how she was
describing like the panels, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: and she was describing Marks, Mark
Skeldon.
[SPEAKER_10]: You notice I've got two little puppets
there today.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because Ryan is the myth of the
rumor is that Ryan will show up any
[SPEAKER_10]: moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, is that Pinocchio there?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Pinocchio.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that Ryan ever has told any lies ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just funny that you made Ryan
Pinocchio though, of all stuffed animals
[SPEAKER_15]: that you have over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we know you have thousands,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know you have thousands stuffed
animals.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put it this way.
[SPEAKER_10]: My granddaughter has thousands.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone that has kids knows the deal on
stuffed animals.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll bet she doesn't have a wookie.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should send her one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does not have a wookie.
[SPEAKER_15]: So remember we also did, all right,
what are the other top 10?
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had that one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you quickly search that and view the
top hits of the top 10 or is that hard to
[SPEAKER_15]: do?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about how many hours in the 150?
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone would have to count all the hours
for every single episode.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 158 calculations.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't break it down very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it shows, but I would say hour
wise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's been good.
[SPEAKER_15]: So four, I would say, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_15]: Three and a half hours average.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something just got deleted from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hash church video.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope didn't get removed.
[SPEAKER_15]: 553 hours on average of information.
[SPEAKER_15]: Scaldone's probably laid a master course
out over the 553 hours.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a lot of information that has
gone on.
[SPEAKER_15]: In those hours.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just think about a course.
[SPEAKER_15]: Think about how long you spend in a
curriculum course.
[SPEAKER_15]: You only get an hour with the teacher.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could go three times a week for a
couple months.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one thing I just noticed was
episode 37 where Lester Grinspoon shows up
[SPEAKER_06]: is almost a five hour episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was one of my favorite episodes,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he shows up again in episode 43 and
it's also almost a five hour episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about the Ross video?
[SPEAKER_13]: When it first come out and the t-shirt
press quick bam and towards the paper.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was with soil grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that was episode 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for whatever reason, I'm kind of in
disbelief.
[SPEAKER_06]: It only has 27,000 views.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had, you had a J asshole sour guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a Pinsky.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had jibs with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, I think even giddy up was there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then soil grown dropped a whole lot of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing that giddy up was in the
room where, where soil grown like did the
[SPEAKER_06]: one inch punch to BHL, the Bruce Lee just
like, yeah, it was that moment for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where everybody's he's like, all right
guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, so basically I just got this
t-shirt press here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a few modifications on a washer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just take a bunch of bud and crush it
up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I put it in here and I pressed down on it
and I wait and I do this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he like explains the whole thing and
you're like, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he opens it up and you're like,
oh damn, there's oil there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you don't think it's a lot,
but then he shows you slabs of the oil
[SPEAKER_15]: that he's collecting.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, oh, he's a madman.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just pressing flowers like crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no, it's up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was up there with, uh, I can't get
enough of this shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: It works.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was up there with bubble hash and the
showing people bubble hash in the,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the late nineties was, was very much up
there with showing people rosin,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, being it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marcus, what was the name of the guy who
showed how to mash it with the big spoon?
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, dry sift on the side of a silver ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Chadwick and Chadwick did that
under the name compassion with a pH.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tried it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It worked, but I couldn't make it pure and
clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause, uh, you know, I wasn't put it in
any kind of a little bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think it was the,
the, the, you know, I tried it also.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was just not like his photos were
impeccable, but the method just wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: easy enough for it to catch on the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially because straight up the
whole, that whole pressing, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: buds, I think it really, really happened
based on how soil grown told the story was
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, he was doing this with,
with hash pressing hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely happened because of the way
that he did that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just saying somebody had tried to
do it earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially to resin, but the actual flower
part, I think, um, no, I think,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he might've been first down
because compassion didn't do it with
[SPEAKER_10]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: He only did it with, uh, either dry sift
or water hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that, and that both.
[SPEAKER_15]: Things been around a while.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I mean, when I started growing in
the nineties and it was like early 2000,
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember having, I remember having a pot
with a little water, turn it on,
[SPEAKER_15]: put a silver bowl on it, just put lots of
Keith in it with a spoon, pressed it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was like this sweating,
like yellow hard yoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause he, he posted it in like 99 2000.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I tried it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem was, which was like very
difficult was once you have it on the bowl
[SPEAKER_15]: was using a razor on a con on a curved
surface.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're like trying to get all this,
like what barely was there out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other problem was you kept getting
resin dry sift into the stuff that you
[SPEAKER_10]: would step to the bowl.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was like, not only was it like
probably a 30% yield, it's basically like,
[SPEAKER_15]: it was basically like, if we were talking
about grapes, like we always do,
[SPEAKER_15]: it was like throwing grapes in a bowl and
just smashing them once.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then just taking like 80% of the guts
and all the stuff out, just a little bit
[SPEAKER_15]: of the juice was there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're trying to like capture that,
you know, it was like very hard.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but it was the next step after what we
called like quiz or whatever quick wash
[SPEAKER_15]: where you take the, you remember that
stuff in the nineties where you like quick
[SPEAKER_15]: wash with ISO and had like a great,
in a glass tray and let that stuff sit
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We always use ethanol, but really,
really cold ethanol with a Sonicator for
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, it came out beautiful yellow
color oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you remember quiz, you remember a
quick wash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I remember, but I never used it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was, uh, I remember like 97 or 98 when
I went to home for Christmas, I'd made
[SPEAKER_15]: some of that stuff and I just,
I can't remember exactly what it was,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it was like, somehow used alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't remember exactly what I did was
alcohol and something.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was like, I put it into a glass
tray and it was like evaporated the
[SPEAKER_15]: alcohol off.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you collected it with a razor and
it was like a green kind of hash,
[SPEAKER_15]: but there was like, it was like this
little tech that people were doing back in
[SPEAKER_15]: the day.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I remember, I mean, if you smoked it,
it really, it really, really, really
[SPEAKER_15]: fucked you up.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I remember that was the first time it
was like any kind of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like at Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I'll tell you 99 the first time
while it was 98 actually, but 99 when I
[SPEAKER_06]: was able to start selling the bags and
showing people this hash that looked like
[SPEAKER_06]: stained glass windows from a church was
always just like the most people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nobody had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone just, it was an unbelievable time
to be the bubble man because I'll tell
[SPEAKER_06]: you, every person I showed everyone was
just like, fuck that's some fucking crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: shit right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I pulled out that 73 bag,
every time the eyebrows went like from
[SPEAKER_06]: this to up here, it was just the full
eyebrow raise.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, oh yeah, you just saw
something that you've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait, dude, just wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just something really,
I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was reminiscent a little bit of the
rosin thing, you know, being at spannibus
[SPEAKER_06]: and at the booth there with Javier at
medical seeds and showing like,
[SPEAKER_06]: urban grower, Matt, the great gardener,
DNA, like all Crockett, like all of these
[SPEAKER_06]: guys had never seen this process before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were showing them with a little
hair straightener right at the booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit was pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff Church was there doing demos.
[SPEAKER_06]: You called me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: From that experience, you're like,
bro, take the 73 or the 90 five star plus
[SPEAKER_15]: and press it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, just do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go get a 25 and do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were doing it with like other stuff
and like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then like, I remember running to the
lab and in Denver and doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then when I pressed it, it was like this,
it came out like clear and then it dried
[SPEAKER_15]: white.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: I went and cut up all my 25 micron drawing
screens.
[SPEAKER_17]: I got them still upstairs.
[SPEAKER_17]: I still pressed with those pieces that I
cut there in the beginning, like
[SPEAKER_17]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say one of the most important
things I think that helped us in this
[SPEAKER_15]: discovery was like we got became
fascinated with with terpenes in the in
[SPEAKER_15]: those episodes.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's really interesting to to look at
them when you're making a hash rosin or a
[SPEAKER_15]: flat flour rosin because of, you know,
the nucleation or like, oh, why does it go
[SPEAKER_15]: from an oil to a butter?
[SPEAKER_15]: And like your mind just automatically
wonders, you know, what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that of recently, like it
finally reached kind of that that the
[SPEAKER_15]: final understanding, if you will,
where we all kind of we get it,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, where where, you know,
there's a breakout that's happening in
[SPEAKER_15]: that process, too, where, you know,
at some point, THCA can be broken out and
[SPEAKER_15]: separated from its oils and lipids and and
all of its things.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, you know, whether you're
repressing rosin a second time,
[SPEAKER_15]: like we talked about to separate the THC
and all the oil, or if you let it
[SPEAKER_15]: naturally separate in high concentration
of terpenes, that whole thing was
[SPEAKER_15]: discovered during Hash Church,
like during these these episodes where we
[SPEAKER_15]: were turning distillate into crystalline
and like conceptually what terpenes
[SPEAKER_15]: actually do in in the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: So and now there was that recent study.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you guys talked about it
before when I sent you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you think of that one, Scaldone?
[SPEAKER_15]: That was through Proton NMR.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to ask you that.
[SPEAKER_12]: There were two.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a recent study that talked about
using NMR to characterize strains,
[SPEAKER_12]: which I think, you know, I talked about
doing a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's this other study that looked
at the high temperature degradants of
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the one?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tell you what, before I go there,
let me go back to something I just wanted
[SPEAKER_12]: to share before I forget it, which is that
I think whether, you know, this is like
[SPEAKER_12]: life imitating church or church imitating
life.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know which one it was,
but I think one of the most important
[SPEAKER_12]: things that the rosin thing did was it
enabled people to make oil anywhere,
[SPEAKER_12]: regardless of whether or not they have
access to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like here in Pennsylvania or the states
out east and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: People were sweating because, again,
there is no regulated industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: at least there wasn't until recently,
that made, you know, closed-loop butane
[SPEAKER_12]: extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: So all the kids were sweating on how do
you get oil, how do you get oil?
[SPEAKER_12]: And they didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then basically a way that with their
girlfriend's hair straightener and some
[SPEAKER_12]: really good nut, they could make oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was extremely enabling for
millions of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, make oil, make oil safely because
people have been making oil for years
[SPEAKER_06]: prior to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've had an increase in people
blowing up and burning themselves very
[SPEAKER_06]: badly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that like a lot of people
didn't believe it until the hash church or
[SPEAKER_12]: other things on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, everyone started posting,
you know, squishing nugs and squishing
[SPEAKER_12]: hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you look at, again, I think what
Tony was alluding to before, which is
[SPEAKER_12]: sophistication.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of this method, which can actually be used
to purify THCA itself from extract,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is, again, the star of the show,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: THCA, that's where everyone wants to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think when it goes back to like you were
saying, these methods on bowls and all of
[SPEAKER_12]: these things were just sort of like ideas
on how to get the oil out.
[SPEAKER_12]: What Rosin did is it made it a practical
method that anybody can do, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: You didn't need to have access to good
butane or you have to worry about residual
[SPEAKER_12]: solvent because there's no solvent issue.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was just an easy way to make safe
oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, like kids in the dorm who were
smoking weed, those kids got caught and
[SPEAKER_12]: they got thrown out of the dorms.
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids who were taking that same nut,
pressing oil and doing dabs, they're in
[SPEAKER_12]: the dorm fine because there's no stink in
their room.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think kids and the whole generation
of people acclimated to doing
[SPEAKER_12]: concentration, they needed to have a way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rosin was that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think whether church had something
to do with it, we were part of that wave
[SPEAKER_12]: of getting the information out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, now there's a hundred different
presses that you can get and yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's still just a straightener who works
just fine if it's the right pressure and
[SPEAKER_12]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't buy a bag of Nug until I squeeze
it and find out what the oil content is,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the one that I have everywhere.
[SPEAKER_17]: I showed everybody, I use this hair
straightener to clump and I did part TV,
[SPEAKER_17]: I did everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: I did that, the BHO video, just cause I
thought it was just hilarious.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_17]: Truly this hair straightener was a change
in my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Props, props to Nick Bradley for coming
out with the DeWalt.
[SPEAKER_18]: The DeWalt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause he, he was the one that added the
press.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when you added that press thing
to your?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I used the Gerwin.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the first thing I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was, it was Nick who did it with a
DeWalt first.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm giving props to Nick Bradley from
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause he was, I know one guy had one
thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got another guy who put it on vices
that led to t-shirt presses that led to
[SPEAKER_17]: the Sasquatch that led to all different
things.
[SPEAKER_17]: We got panic clamps now.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's all kinds of great clamps out
there squishing Rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think also it brought a lot of
attention to the growers and, and the
[SPEAKER_15]: method of growing because you know,
some of the, you know, benefits that we
[SPEAKER_15]: talked about when you're using a solvent
and you're going through that process,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's a refinement and you're trying to
decontaminate and centralize your result.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if your goal is to get all THCA or
all THC, I mean, that's why you solvents.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if, if you know what you're doing,
you can, you can have a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess you'd say forgiveness.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas going through like a Rosin,
you're smoking everything that was on that
[SPEAKER_15]: plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think what it did, cause I remember
there's that big explosion of Rosin and
[SPEAKER_15]: then there was that realization of,
wait a minute, wait a minute, we're
[SPEAKER_15]: pressing all of the possible oils and
everything on that plant through a little
[SPEAKER_15]: tiny screen and out comes oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what about the bug juice?
[SPEAKER_15]: What about this?
[SPEAKER_15]: We started joking about, but then it
became a real thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause you're going to press PM,
you're going to press pesticides.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to do, you're going to
concentrate everything else.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now put a microscope back on the
growers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is this organic at home way to,
to make oil, but then what's the flower
[SPEAKER_11]: and have to be clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that has shirts also helped
there because we brought a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: attention to organic growing clean
medicine, uh, you know, and we were,
[SPEAKER_15]: we were kind of the, we were talking about
that first, where we were saying,
[SPEAKER_15]: oh, well, you're right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, there was a lot of BHO makers and it
was all memes and all kinds of crazy stuff
[SPEAKER_15]: going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if you smoke Rosin, you're gay,
you know, uh, or it turns you gay or
[SPEAKER_15]: something.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all these like back and forth,
but at the end of the day, they are,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, they, it did bring a lot of
attention to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, you know, when something becomes
easy like that, that you could do at home,
[SPEAKER_15]: you just got to be extremely, uh,
aware and conscious of the actual starting
[SPEAKER_15]: material because you're concentrating
whatever that grower put on there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, that's why I still, you know,
I've always liked just kind of like
[SPEAKER_15]: washing the plant first or trying to
separate the resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if you, even if you may, it's so like
an outdoor, even if you, uh, just did
[SPEAKER_15]: everything dry sift, you still could wash
the dry sift and just wash off anything
[SPEAKER_15]: that would be on the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I just want to say that I feel
extremely gay after smoking Rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just brings my levels up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel iry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel gay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's the point of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to feel bad when you feel good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Resin in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_10]: They make it with a bat and they call it
batty boy hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not true.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Derogatory term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam has the low brow humor.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the, well, at least you don't,
at least, you know, it's like the ghost.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like in the movie, uh, Ghostbusters,
when they spray you with the pink gel,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, of the goodness and they're
like, and then the guys get, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: sprayed down and they're just like totally
in love and hey man, everything's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's like the Rosin
experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's, I'm all right with that
experience.
[SPEAKER_15]: At least you're not filled with hate.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you imagine the Rosin community
making memes that are like, if you smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: BHO, you're gay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like think of like, that's like,
like that's some 12 year old ignorant shit
[SPEAKER_06]: right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's like, that's just very
strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: To bring in someone's sexuality and to try
and like, it's like, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_06]: attack.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're selling a new kind of pot called
sex pot for women.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to make you have more and
more frequent and longer orgasms.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the same thing, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Time out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Women have orgasms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they do unless they're married to
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was getting a laugh at a couple of
the married guys on the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little laughing, little having fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: King Justin Hudson.
[SPEAKER_15]: That seems a little off, but yeah,
because I did, because I do think there's
[SPEAKER_15]: some valid information there and then you
got to let's, let's lead up to that paper
[SPEAKER_06]: because that paper, there's a part of the
discussion that we completely missed,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was another conversation that hash
church was very much involved in and
[SPEAKER_06]: helped propel and you yourself,
Tony was a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is blue river and the first cannabis
derived terpenes that are actually made
[SPEAKER_06]: available to people so they can smell them
and try them and experience them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was also a huge, huge part of the
conversation that I personally saw grow
[SPEAKER_06]: out of hash church and spread like a
wildfire.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a, you know, leading up to the
paper that we're about to discuss is the
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation that was, I mean,
keep in mind, it's not like we started
[SPEAKER_06]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam started this conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost 20 years ago, but it goes to show
you when the time is right, the time is
[SPEAKER_06]: right because even K from trichome
technologies was, had been on it for,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it was two years or three
years, or if he wants to say 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_06]: years, but the bottom line is nobody was
doing shit about it until Tony and Horatio
[SPEAKER_06]: stepped into the ring until they both
decided I'm going to try my, my hand at
[SPEAKER_06]: making some terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony had terpenes like fucking two weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what do you, like, what do you mean
you just made terpenes?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I kind of shamed Horatio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a couple of months later,
I was like, listen, Tony had those terps
[SPEAKER_06]: like a week or two later, you got to get
on the ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Horatio had terpenes like maybe a week
or two after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, those were the first two
available terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great that Sam was the first.
[SPEAKER_06]: He showed me pure, you know, fruit-based
terpenes or plant-based terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_06]: modulating effect that they can have.
[SPEAKER_06]: On cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kay was one of the first people to
talk to me about cannabis-derived terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Tony was the first person to put that
shit in my hand, to put it under my nose,
[SPEAKER_06]: to put it in my dab rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Horatio was the second.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got to give both of those guys mad
props before we start this next part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the conversation, because that was a huge,
that was as big as rosin in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: making these terpenes become available.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only that, but lighting the,
you know, it's funny because I remember
[SPEAKER_06]: Kay being like, oh, I was a little worried
about kind of wanting to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, he was worried that people
were going to do it wrong, this,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, that's always the one side of
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have the other side of
things, which is, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: why don't we just put it out into the
world and we can let the world decide and
[SPEAKER_06]: we can all kind of bioassay and go through
this together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that leads us up to where we are
going.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and I would add to, I would say this
that in Johnny Beat was there a lot of the
[SPEAKER_15]: times too, when we were in Amsterdam and
did this and there was even, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: people miss this, that there was like,
when we were doing the steam tech,
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, oh yeah, this is basically the
fail tech.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was some, the terpenes were
different and, and they, there's not a,
[SPEAKER_15]: there wasn't a purity or stability factor
to it or replication.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Kay called those artifacts,
you know, barely, barely shadows of their
[SPEAKER_15]: former self.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and the other, the other,
the issue is we, I mean, people don't
[SPEAKER_15]: realize, but we had this conversation for
eight months, maybe even a year before it
[SPEAKER_15]: actually got released.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we were the whole goal.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to create, get these terpenes
back into the decarbon activated versions
[SPEAKER_15]: of Prana and stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: But these were, these were just like
little side texts.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were like, Oh, maybe we could smoke
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I remember it was a year of us talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had the same issue of releasing it
because there's good and bad that comes
[SPEAKER_15]: with that.
[SPEAKER_15]: A, it'll get out there.
[SPEAKER_15]: People will try to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some will do it with the, you know,
in a way that may harm people.
[SPEAKER_15]: And looking back, I think that like
releasing, you know, pure form terpenes
[SPEAKER_15]: without like, you know, the full studies
always irritated me.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just, you know, want to put it out
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I do feel that like we didn't know,
you know, and we had these conversations
[SPEAKER_15]: on hash church and said, what do you think
a safe range is?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, how much is president a flower?
[SPEAKER_15]: Flowers can have up to eight, nine,
you know, I've seen 10% terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_15]: on flowers very rarely, but you know,
sometimes it's one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_06]: much higher on a concentrate made from
that same material.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could dry sift in full melt have hit
over 10% terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you knew that it was there.
[SPEAKER_15]: We were smoking it, but once you put it
into pure form, people start dipping.
[SPEAKER_15]: It, uh, the whole dip, uh, dip in dabs and
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like looking back how, how far terpenes
actually go, uh, and how, and how far,
[SPEAKER_15]: what the use is.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I can turn one milliliter into a
thousand beverages.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, you know, and like back then it
was like one drop per beverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, remember when we were just
pouring, like that was horrible.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like looking back, it's just like a
little juvenile, you know?
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would admit to the, the fact that
like, uh, the going that intense,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's like anything else.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, you find something new and
you want to see how far you can take it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, at some point you have to know,
is this going to be okay for me,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, as an individual?
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's not, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: You might still do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just need to know what the safety,
the safety is, you know, they're just
[SPEAKER_15]: like, Hey, jumping off the side of a
building, uh, on a bungee cord,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, may save it may, may work.
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jumping, you know, I know everybody
showed you a lot of good stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to terpenes, but I want to be the
first guy to, to show you a terpene being
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this is a, a strain of different
bacteria actually creating a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that bloom right there is,
is an actual, uh, picture of a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, of a terpene, um, in process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be the bacteria guy that
shows you that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So explain that a little more.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the red circle, is that a cell?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an actual, uh, secondary
metabolite, uh, from the, uh, the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of bacteria creating a smell
and actually producing, uh, an exudate
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, or secondary metabolite,
which is a terpene bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just like right on par for the hash
church bar that has been set.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always glad when you show up,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the guy that showed you a,
a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go all the way back to the small,
the small, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The molecular and you guys have done so
much with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so, uh, so honored to be here
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is a big, a big part of the
conversation, as big as rosin,
[SPEAKER_06]: as big as anything else that we've talked
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big, big, one of the big
conversations that came out of hash church
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure was, uh, just all of this
interesting terpene information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're still like, it's why,
you know, this, this discussion that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to have about, uh, heating up
terpenes and heating up terpenes too hot
[SPEAKER_06]: and the degradation and what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's why exactly when blue river was
started, that blue river wasn't saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should take these and take huge giant
dabs and inhale them.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we were doing ourselves was
bioassaying that very thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hitting pure terpenes through the
vapix tail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to this day, I'm convinced that it was
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in no way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it feel bad, but it was also a very
delicate heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very small amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did we ever get too much?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we ever dip too much where I was like,
that's not an enjoyable hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the beginning, Tony was the destroyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was first, first times in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, our temperatures are way off.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember we used to dab at 750,
then 700, then 500.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I'm like anyone over 550.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, Ooh, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, honestly for me, the vapix tail is one
of the only units that does not degrade
[SPEAKER_06]: the rip in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I can hit pure terps off the vapix
tail in those little quartz cartridges
[SPEAKER_06]: that you slide into the tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is super enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just at any temperature, I have a hard
time enjoying it off of any nail where it
[SPEAKER_06]: hits direct and, and, and evaporates.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just too violent.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we have those really long,
uh, we have those really long skinny
[SPEAKER_15]: pipettes.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just put a drop in it and you use no
heat and you just, you just breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's also all of these little cool
tops that have been designed that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: put terpenes into.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have your little terp cap that
you're hitting fresh terpenes that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: just not heating up at all, but it's going
through the pipe and giving you that sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of, uh, you know, it's definitely one of
the things that attracted us to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes sense that in the near future
that we will take it as far as it can be
[SPEAKER_06]: taken, that much science will be looked
at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, uh, you know, we, the,
the guinea pigs who are using these things
[SPEAKER_06]: in the next 20 or 30 or 40 years,
we'll be able to clearly show people,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, the pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, one thing to add on that before Scott
on goes into this, we once had a
[SPEAKER_15]: conversation about color.
[SPEAKER_15]: And how I got in that argument where
terpenes were seemed to give off some kind
[SPEAKER_15]: of color because of all this different
stuff that like, if we had the same base
[SPEAKER_15]: of hash and we use different terpenes,
we had different quote unquote color hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember that Mark?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, uh, or scaldone.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, um, so there's some things that
I would wanted to update on that because
[SPEAKER_15]: I've gone through a lot of profiles now
and a lot of different ways of using
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenes, whether it's in with like,
uh, you know, a, uh, raw full spectrum
[SPEAKER_15]: with THCA, like from, uh, from a hash
rosin or a live rosin or from flowers or
[SPEAKER_15]: activated versions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, what I think it is is, so let's look,
let's look at terpenaline versus humaline,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So things that are very high in
terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you would get like, uh, we've got one
that's like a Dutch treat, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: a Jack Frost would be, um, and they're
always, they always produce a oil that's
[SPEAKER_15]: like a clear, like this, this particular
color.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's never a butter.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's never, it's, uh, it's, it's never a
butter.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always an oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always this particular color that
comes out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, some people would think that,
oh yeah, it's not a pure white color.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like this, like, um, it's not as
desirable, but it's always got that same
[SPEAKER_15]: time kind of taste.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think what it is, and you know that
what I see is a limonene, beta carofaline
[SPEAKER_15]: and terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_15]: If those three combinations are the
highest peaks, you get a certain
[SPEAKER_15]: consistency of the oil, which makes a
certain reflection or color based on that,
[SPEAKER_15]: that, that profile influence.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you look at something that's very
high, uh, in THCA, meaning the plant
[SPEAKER_15]: itself and the resin on the plant itself
was, was fresh and didn't really activate
[SPEAKER_15]: much.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you were able to get like an 80%
rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, in THCA form and you didn't have any
terpenaline and you had, uh, and you had
[SPEAKER_15]: more of a, uh, the humaline and the,
uh, beta carofaline and the pinings,
[SPEAKER_15]: you would start to see more of a butter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and that has to do a little bit with
the heads and things, but I found that
[SPEAKER_15]: it's really has to do with the profiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it comes down to heat versus no
heat and different semi activation points
[SPEAKER_15]: and different things.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I thought was the color wasn't
necessarily the color.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was more of the top tier profiles
of these terpenes that have the influence
[SPEAKER_15]: on the consistency of the actual extract.
[SPEAKER_15]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, somewhat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes a lot of sense to me, Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like terpenes in some way would
be a sort of lubricant or solvent,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you will, to help.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, my internet dropped out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I didn't catch all of what you said.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you go back just and just ask the
question succinctly?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I was just saying a little bit of
what you said.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just saying back then I thought it
was the color was the terpene thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm saying later that I don't think
it's, it wasn't that at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, what it is, is now when I've been
like, so what we've been doing with our
[SPEAKER_15]: oil is taking like, uh, uh, you know,
uh, extensive testing of the flower than
[SPEAKER_15]: the extract then our final like Trinity
oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and when you start to look at
all of the different terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_15]: um, because we're taking cannabis terpene
from the same variety and pairing them
[SPEAKER_15]: with the extracts and they're the same
terpene profile, but you get a different
[SPEAKER_15]: percentage and consistency.
[SPEAKER_15]: So as you go from five to 10 to 15 to 30%,
um, if the, if the trio of those terpenes,
[SPEAKER_15]: if the top one was terpenaline,
almost every single time I've seen the oil
[SPEAKER_15]: come out like this golden sap,
it's never butter.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when you look at other ones like
strawberry banana goo, it's always a white
[SPEAKER_15]: butter, um, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we've talked about hydrophilic or
hydrophobic and what they're doing with
[SPEAKER_15]: the moisture, but ultimately the terpene
profile in the, in the top three and the
[SPEAKER_15]: way that it's setting will change this,
this consistency or this response,
[SPEAKER_15]: which then appears to change the color,
but it's not a color thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's how the oils are.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are all high THCA extracts.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if you take those butters and
let's say try to act double boil them down
[SPEAKER_15]: and semi activate or activate,
um, obviously the color then also changes
[SPEAKER_15]: as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yes, if we're comparing just straight,
uh, as raw as you could go on,
[SPEAKER_15]: on whether it was a flower rosin or a hash
rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So different combinations of terpenes have
different solvating abilities in terms of
[SPEAKER_12]: their abilities to keep THCA in solution,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So certain combinations of terpenes aren't
going to be able to hold THCA in solution
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as other combinations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what you're seeing is just a
manifestation of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly like ones that are much more
solvating and, um, the higher level
[SPEAKER_12]: terpenes that are found or the
sesquiterpenes like karyophylline and,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, or less volatile, um, have different
flavor profiles and sort of seem to be
[SPEAKER_12]: ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just kind of like your, your trade
off on gaining that terpene profile in,
[SPEAKER_12]: in the flower from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then bringing that through and
reincorporating that into some process,
[SPEAKER_12]: um, purified fraction of THCA.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that, that, that, that's what you're
doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I, the way to view your
question again, just going back and
[SPEAKER_12]: viewing the whole terpene thing is kind of
like a musical ensemble, like an orchestra
[SPEAKER_12]: is that you have to set the volume of the
orchestra correctly from where it was set
[SPEAKER_12]: in the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: You can turn up the volume really loud,
but then yeah, you're, you're carrying
[SPEAKER_12]: basically what you're trying to do is keep
the relative in the terpene is the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the flavor in your, in your consumable
remains what it was in the plant,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is a delicate balance, especially
when you talk about thermally treating any
[SPEAKER_12]: of these most sensitive of terpenes and
monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Sam has talked about, and we've
talked about a bunch of times on church,
[SPEAKER_12]: the curing, uh, chemistry that happens
post harvesting and curing being separate
[SPEAKER_12]: from drying.
[SPEAKER_12]: So drying bulk removal of water,
but then a process by which there is
[SPEAKER_12]: chemistry that's happening still on the
plant, but the plants no longer alive,
[SPEAKER_12]: but there's sort of terpenes that are
coming to their thermodynamic dead end
[SPEAKER_12]: before they actually present themselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what now is a very, very different
flavor than what you would get in a,
[SPEAKER_12]: in a freshly frozen extract.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I was getting at, yeah,
what you just said earlier, that was
[SPEAKER_15]: really important.
[SPEAKER_15]: So terpenaline is acting like something
more of a, of a solubility solvent.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when you see, I mean, you know,
like the holy waters, all those like high
[SPEAKER_12]: terp fractions, which have a lot of,
um, usually it's are kind of like orange,
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of like a bright orange, more,
more orange than a brownish.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are typically high in terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_12]: Terpenaline has got, got one of these
double bonds that could precess around the
[SPEAKER_12]: ring and variety of different geometric
isomers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And all of these are different peaks in
the GC and they all have different,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, further oxidation, manifold,
some of them oxidized into terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, and you know, again, some of these
degradation products that you're seeing,
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I was really excited when I first saw
this paper come out, because from
[SPEAKER_12]: everything that we've been saying here on
hash church, Tony, right, that,
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah, terpenes at room temperature are
different than terpenes when you heat them
[SPEAKER_12]: up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: That may have been like one of the first
things I said on hash church, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I go back to like when Horatio first
dragged me in and said, Hey Mark,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're talking about chemistry.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need, we need, we need you to help us
understand.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a question around terpene stability
and whether or not, and it was just before
[SPEAKER_12]: the hash sheen paper had come out and I
had said, look, these are reactive
[SPEAKER_12]: species.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have reactive double bonds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of these things, if you shine on
them in the presence of air, they form
[SPEAKER_12]: hydro peroxides and then they start
degrading into all kinds of different like
[SPEAKER_12]: methacron and like other things that,
yeah, you don't want to be deeply inhaling
[SPEAKER_12]: into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, again, when this paper
first came out, I was really excited
[SPEAKER_12]: because this study has to be done.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as I read the paper and I became just
a little disappointed on the level of
[SPEAKER_12]: science and what they did.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the most important thing that
comes out of a study like this is not to
[SPEAKER_12]: critique the level of science,
which to me, I give about a C minus to
[SPEAKER_12]: tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have had that graduate student go
back and repeat that thing like 10 more
[SPEAKER_12]: times.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have had them do a different,
I would have just, I would have done the
[SPEAKER_12]: study differently.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just say it that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the most important thing that comes
out of science that's published like this,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is maybe not the best, is this
discussion that we're having right now on
[SPEAKER_12]: how important it is to do this and to do
this carefully.
[SPEAKER_12]: And notice that they used NMR,
which I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_12]: And notice that what they're doing is
they're showing a temperature dependence.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you pull data, Marcus,
if you could share that link in the chat
[SPEAKER_12]: room so our viewers can follow along.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got Chem Church 101 here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you go to, in that link,
go to figure one, which tells a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what you can see is the temperature
dependence as a function of methacrolein
[SPEAKER_12]: being measured at the nanogram level.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which a nanogram is a 10 to minus ninth.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very, very exceedingly small amount
of material.
[SPEAKER_12]: But clearly, within the error bars of the
measurement, you can see a temperature
[SPEAKER_12]: dependence on methacrolein being generated
as a function of temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now 526 degrees C, let's see, that's
about, that's almost a thousand degrees,
[SPEAKER_12]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can someone do that conversion for me?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like nine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hot, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I think that that's an important
finding from the study, but we've already
[SPEAKER_12]: talked about that before.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you go to, let's see, what's their
next table?
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, scheme one, they talk about some of
the structures of a combination of
[SPEAKER_12]: myrcine, limonene, and linalool.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys aren't taking low temp dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not taking low temp dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, that's the cleaning
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're taking glowy's.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that the take home message that,
you know, that the, the chemistry,
[SPEAKER_12]: the degradation chemistry is a function
of, of the temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you look now at table one down
below where it says they're measuring both
[SPEAKER_12]: methacrolein and benzene at the nanogram
per milligram level, let's see,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's a, that's a part per million.
[SPEAKER_12]: So these numbers are in parts.
[SPEAKER_12]: Per million in a 27 coming out of fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: OG with limonene.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess they're, they're just doing this
on neat.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is also, this is also, I think they
clarified it wasn't like a triple
[SPEAKER_15]: molecular distilled oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just, this was like just a,
a BHO extraction.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just some BHO.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, I think that that's valid for
the study because this was, that's the
[SPEAKER_14]: average.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dabbing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you go down to product
quantification, I mean, I think these
[SPEAKER_12]: numbers are important here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it says because dabbing a topography,
it's talking about, you know, being able
[SPEAKER_12]: to assess the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what they're seeing is that with
methacrolein 185 plus or minus 11 parts
[SPEAKER_12]: per billion at a temperature of again,
526, which is up around 900 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, shit don't fucking dab at 900
degrees and look at look what happens when
[SPEAKER_12]: you drop your dab temperature 22,
they're undetectable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that this does tell the story
of the temperature of the nail being very,
[SPEAKER_12]: very important, but I would have done a
more detailed, more quantitative study.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I don't want to be critical too
much.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we get that study happening,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause also everything you said combined
with also hitting it off of different
[SPEAKER_06]: surfaces, hitting it off of titanium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitting it off of sapphire, hitting it off
of convection versus conduction.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hit it off of sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I mean, I think what we've
talked about here on church, I mean,
[SPEAKER_12]: this is obviously one thing that you can
investigate, which is that if you take
[SPEAKER_12]: material and you put it inside a vial and
you put, you know, the nail material in
[SPEAKER_12]: there and now you heat that up while
obviously it's got to be in a fuse port
[SPEAKER_12]: silica.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't do this just a regular glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't try this at home kids.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if that could actually be taken up to
temperature now, you could actually study
[SPEAKER_12]: by headspace GC, the different profiles of
what you're getting by examining
[SPEAKER_12]: different, different nail materials.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Jeff Raber did a study for hive nail
again, some time ago on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think Jeff's method, which I think
was published, I want to say two or three
[SPEAKER_12]: years ago was a little more sound than I
think what I'm reading in this paper in
[SPEAKER_12]: terms of how they collected their sample
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was excited about this until I found out
that you needed a cigarette smoking
[SPEAKER_12]: machine, which is how they conducted their
studies.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was like, oh shit, how am I going
to repeat this?
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a cigarette smoking machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got, you know, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to one of my investors and say,
oh, I need to buy a cigarette smoking
[SPEAKER_12]: machine to study this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have access to wooks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just putting it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Mark, you'll have to admit that they
were never finding this in herbal
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis, which has smoked it,
I believe 451.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they would have found it,
it would have been reported a long time
[SPEAKER_10]: ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that where the trend goes or
that these materials are in there,
[SPEAKER_12]: the less likely they're going to be pushed
beyond the limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it totally makes sense that at
the higher temperatures you're seeing more
[SPEAKER_12]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_12]: That almost looks like a first,
what we call kinetically a first order
[SPEAKER_12]: relationship, which is a typical in an
Arrhenius sense, Arrhenius is a guy who
[SPEAKER_12]: figured out the mathematics for this a
long time ago, that there's a linear
[SPEAKER_12]: dependency based on temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's totally to be expected.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what it comes down to is
that is the temperature and besides the
[SPEAKER_15]: surfaces, too, but the temperature is
super key.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I also found was terpenes will
organically degrade with a rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I mean by that is if you start
with, say, a flower rosin that test 80
[SPEAKER_15]: percent, it's 76 percent THCA and four
percent THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you take that and you use the same
terpene profile from that flower and
[SPEAKER_15]: saturate up to, say, a 30 percent and let
that sit six months.
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be fully activated or very close to
being activated, which then tells you that
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenes have this other effective
property that's going on, too,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is what I thought was affecting
color.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's an aging mechanism that's probably
at work there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, that you're right, has a lot to
do with not only taking something that
[SPEAKER_12]: starts out as its life being clear and
turning color.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen that color formation happen on
the rotavap.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're something down that's, you know,
basically colorless.
[SPEAKER_12]: By the time you get it down, it's like
yellowish and it starts to actually turn
[SPEAKER_12]: almost in front of your eyes because it's
being exposed to now high concentrations
[SPEAKER_12]: of oxygen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of these things are protected
because they live within the waxy envelope
[SPEAKER_12]: of the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're not being exposed to the
levels of oxygen now that they're being
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of stripped from their plant
protective—you know, they're being
[SPEAKER_12]: exposed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting enough on that, it does— All
terpenes, almost without exception,
[SPEAKER_12]: have a shelf life in that they'll either
evaporate or they'll degrade into a mostly
[SPEAKER_12]: yellow, darker colored material from which
they came.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I kept flowers for a year in the same
condition in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_15]: And even over a year, the THCA on the
flowers will convert over to THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not all the way, but it could happen at 25
or 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kept them for two years, not even in a
vacuum, just on the shelf in the dark at
[SPEAKER_10]: room temperatures.
[SPEAKER_10]: And less than 10 percent converted from
THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: It only converted 10 percent in two years?
[SPEAKER_10]: In two years.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was shocked and surprised.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of variety was that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Skunk.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well, that's why.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't— Yeah, I mean, maybe there was
a protective envelope of terpene stink
[SPEAKER_12]: containing those buds, keeping oxygen—
Well, after two years, the THC level was
[SPEAKER_10]: practically the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of it was still in the form of THCA,
but most of the terpenes were gone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: So long story short with that article,
though, so when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_15]: concentrations of PPM, so think about
this, if something has any kind of solvent
[SPEAKER_15]: left behind or residual and you hit it at
a higher temperature with a higher
[SPEAKER_15]: concentration of terpenes, moral of the
story is it's probably not so good for
[SPEAKER_15]: you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to change the subject for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not very far away, but something Peter
shared with us when he first came on,
[SPEAKER_11]: that picture of metabolites that are
terpenes, one of the things I've been
[SPEAKER_11]: exploring is how soil biology changes what
terpenes and how much of them express in
[SPEAKER_11]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were talking earlier about how
purity of the plant is really important
[SPEAKER_11]: for the purity of the end product that
we're producing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my question is, how much effect really
does soil biology or the biology in the
[SPEAKER_11]: soil and on the plants have to do with the
terpenes that are going to be expressed by
[SPEAKER_11]: the genetics of the plant?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's going to be a certain
terpene profile there just based on the
[SPEAKER_11]: genetics, but I have a feeling,
or it's been my experience, I'll say it
[SPEAKER_11]: like that, that as the soil biology has
improved in my garden and in other gardens
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen and worked with, the terpenes
not only increase in quantity in the plant
[SPEAKER_11]: material, and of course the plants are
more vital, but it occurs to me that
[SPEAKER_11]: perhaps different species of biology
enhance a plant's ability to produce more
[SPEAKER_11]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what that picture was suggestive
of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and actually, if you'd like,
what I can do is actually quantify exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're talking about and give you a
pretty comprehensive overview of exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what that does on a biological level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me share my screen with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think that's an important
story.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is different strains of bacteria
creating a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did with one of our hemp
cultivators is we quantified the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that was in a treated and
non-treated soil to increase the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right here, what you'll see is the
microbes that we calculated in one gram of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the treated, we had 83 billion
colony forming units per gram of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the non-treated, we had 72,000
different microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what ended up happening was we saw
a nitrogen boost within the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis of treated plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this study was conducted by North
Carolina Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw a 30% increase in leaf nitrogen
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we looked at phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is a big one for biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with an increased amount of
biology, the plant is actually getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: physics that it needs to create terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your macronutrients are going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is in a highly biologically
active soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all these nutrients are essential for
the plant to have the physics it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: create the different types of terpenes to
protect itself in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw at the end, so this was
500.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took 250 treated and then 250
non-treated plants with a highly
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically active soil, why people say
organic or growing with bacteria is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found a 42.85% increase in the
amount of oil that the hemp plant
[SPEAKER_01]: produced.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you say oil, are you referring to
cannabinoids, other things or just
[SPEAKER_10]: essential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was just the CBD analysis that
the laboratory did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabinoid oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which could be head size or just oil
content in general of the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's still significantly, it's not like
it was like a 4%, it's 42%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, regardless of what it is, it would
just be interesting if the same thing was
[SPEAKER_06]: done to plants that are producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the embryo oil, the essential amino
acid rich oil, the hemp oil was also
[SPEAKER_06]: increased, I would almost have to
guarantee it, you would think.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guarantee you that growing living soil
rich that's making plants grow millions of
[SPEAKER_10]: tiny, tiny white roots absolutely does
increase smells, terpenes and
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And resin in general, absolutely that's
true.
[SPEAKER_10]: But whether or not it can actually make
other terpenes present, I've never seen
[SPEAKER_10]: any proof of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you feel it would, I mean,
obviously in my experience, I was gonna
[SPEAKER_15]: say that I had this conversation with
Brian from Vital a couple of days ago when
[SPEAKER_15]: he was like, just kind of checking in on
me and I was just, we just catching up and
[SPEAKER_15]: I was talking about Peter and your product
as like talking about kind of like,
[SPEAKER_15]: as a probiotic and an essential in the
grow system and keeping it as a key thing
[SPEAKER_15]: moving forward and like what he's doing
with his soil and vital system.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I've seen the guys from Pharmacy
Bros that have a seven year soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have those, what they call Pomp
Pachos and they do 600 gallons and they
[SPEAKER_15]: save the soil in the 600 gallons and spend
years with the same soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: From these type of growers versus say even
not just indoor, but other types of
[SPEAKER_15]: growers that grow in the same competitive
environment, if you will, that don't spend
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of time or have a lot of education
on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like even like Wade's doing it as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like if I take something from
somebody that understands the soil and
[SPEAKER_15]: understands how to grow organically every
single time, the terpene percentage,
[SPEAKER_15]: overall percentage, if you will,
aroma, flavor, oil content is always
[SPEAKER_15]: boosted.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cannabinoids and terpenes always come hand
in hand boosted.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, you know, if it's the head size,
if you will, or there's more heads being
[SPEAKER_15]: developed or more oil being secreted,
but I see it like night and day between
[SPEAKER_15]: the growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder, Tony, if it'll ever get to the
point where people will take a vegetative
[SPEAKER_10]: plant, grow it as big as they can.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just about ready to flower and
then you whack it back halfway like they
[SPEAKER_10]: do with grapes to produce fewer but
superior grapes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that'll ever be done with
cannabis to produce fewer heads of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis, but more superior, or if it
would be effective.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I tend to think that and it's strange
because I find with the, and this is,
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's not, I don't want to
generalize too much, but all of the
[SPEAKER_15]: varieties that I see that are grown
outdoor that are grown correctly produce a
[SPEAKER_15]: interesting type of resin to where it's
maybe, it's not like covered in trichomes
[SPEAKER_15]: like you see in indoor, where this seems
to be like just a lot more coverage in
[SPEAKER_15]: general.
[SPEAKER_15]: You like, every time you see like even
organic indoors, just flooded with
[SPEAKER_15]: trichomes, just, but the outdoor,
they get these like juicier, bigger buds,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, like, but it's not like,
it's not covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_15]: You still see it, but something
inherently, I think that's why I always
[SPEAKER_15]: said and thought and we had this argument
before, and I think you were, I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_15]: what side of it you were on at that time,
but I always felt like we were growing
[SPEAKER_15]: really big grapes outdoors.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like things were just bigger and there was
just bigger oil and maybe it wasn't so
[SPEAKER_15]: much on the outside as was, as it is
closer to the surface of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_15]: but the oil content and the turpentine
content, we're talking like, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: everything's, you know, a good 2% plus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a new variety that I collected
from Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_10]: It grows resin heads the size of small
melons.
[SPEAKER_10]: Melons or melons?
[SPEAKER_10]: They glow in the dark, so they're really
easy to find if you drop on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Melons or melanomas?
[SPEAKER_10]: Both.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was going to say, so to add to you
what you're talking about, the soil and
[SPEAKER_15]: things is that I see that there's a boost
in the heads, but then there's this,
[SPEAKER_15]: other oil and it's boosting terpenes
within inherently in the plant and on the
[SPEAKER_15]: surface of the leaf, but it's not just in
the head.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think what happens with the plant is
maybe it expresses and exceeds its head
[SPEAKER_15]: count.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if it's really healthy and really
strong, it starts to produce these oils in
[SPEAKER_15]: a different way that come out very well in
rosin and they come out very well in
[SPEAKER_15]: terpene extractions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see the numbers are always boosted.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you know, I just got a variety
from Verdant that was like overall 24%
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like 20% CBD and 5% THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's all organic, vital, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things, Tony, that we're
also seeing is, you know, the plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: only hit a certain genetic expression,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can only produce so many terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in growers that aren't getting a lot of
terpenes, we're seeing that our bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: will help them achieve maybe a level where
you guys are already at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you guys get to your level,
when the plant can only produce so many
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, what we're finding is a
diversity of biology will increase more of
[SPEAKER_01]: the type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of seeing like maybe seven or
eight major terpene types, you'll see 10
[SPEAKER_01]: or 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the flavor and the aroma and the
comprehensiveness of the terpenoline
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy is just a lot more comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_15]: And where do you think those oils are
being developed?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing that different types.
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, if you don't see them in a
regular plant that's not grown that way,
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're not expressed at all even,
you know, in tiny, tiny amounts,
[SPEAKER_10]: then do they have a synthase to produce
that compound?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are being used in macro doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have your majors, but then
you'll see micro doses of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you add our bacteria,
those micro doses are... Okay,
[SPEAKER_10]: that I could absolutely believe that
you're making a really tiny peak grow to a
[SPEAKER_10]: bigger size.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's easy to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a tiny peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with the introduction of more
bacteria, those peaks are higher.
[SPEAKER_10]: That could certainly be.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen healthier soil, healthier
plants, healthier roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely creates healthier resin,
which is more terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's working with nature, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the key there is nitrogen fixation,
because the plant doesn't fix nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_12]: but the bacteria does.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they're able to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And synthases are proteins which are made
of amino acids, and amino acids require
[SPEAKER_12]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so those machines that make terpenes
just aren't made.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're made by, like we said before,
synthases.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those synthases are basically large
proteins that have to be made before you
[SPEAKER_12]: can make the terpene.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those all require nitrogen, nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, they require, what is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: GGP?
[SPEAKER_12]: Bacteria has had the time course of
evolution to figure out how to fix
[SPEAKER_12]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's just let the bacteria do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you what, you guys over the
years have done such a good job educating
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry, getting people aware of how
important terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm so humbled and grateful to be a
part of maybe helping disclose how
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are made, which is from bacteria.
[SPEAKER_15]: So one thing that we hadn't covered yet,
which kind of dawned upon me, maybe you've
[SPEAKER_15]: guys could answer this.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the plant's going, as female
plant, you know, sense of million,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's going through its ovulation period.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're talking about the nitrogen
starting early with, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: most growers have this consciousness of,
hey, we're going to either foliar feed or
[SPEAKER_15]: just use low levels of phosphorus and
higher nitrogen when it's vegging.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it's flipped and we're using
higher phosphorus and much less nitrogen
[SPEAKER_15]: during the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there is an ovulation period of which
it changes like from like day 24 and day
[SPEAKER_15]: like 36 or something, depends on a
variety.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's that ovulation period.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the change in the hormone of the plant
something else that's indicative of how
[SPEAKER_15]: the uptake or how this is working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we have found with
comprehensive biology attached to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere is that the plant is actually
auto regulating its uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a sacred kind of
communication that the root will have with
[SPEAKER_01]: its digestive system that says,
hey, at this stage of my growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: of my involvement, I'm going to need some
nitrogen or I'm going to need some
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen is it will enzymatic
ly communicate with the biodiversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: the rhizosphere to allow them to act as
almost like a chelating agent for
[SPEAKER_01]: particles such as phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, if you take the root and
you've got a particle this size,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you put your fertilizer in a
phosphorus, the plant will enzymatic ly
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate with the biofilm of organisms
that are creating acids to break down that
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus so that as it hits the root,
it just kind of, it's like juicing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the higher awareness or
communication that the plant will have
[SPEAKER_01]: with its biology to process nitrogen
fixation, phosphorus solubilization,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the things that are so important to
have the physics to create the terpenes is
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond, it's a naturally occurring thing
that just happens when you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically active soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and phosphorus is the key element
that holds DNA together, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: DNA is basically a polymer that's derived
from a polyphosphate backbone.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the actual element of DNA itself
requires nitrogen, requires phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so without phosphorus and nitrogen,
you're starving a living system from being
[SPEAKER_12]: able to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is that, and to answer
your question, Tony, is that once you do
[SPEAKER_01]: have a comprehensive biologically active
system, it's gonna kind of take the
[SPEAKER_01]: guesswork out of your fertilizing
variances because it's such a dynamic,
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive thing to actually feed your
plants or give them the right energy to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow that there can be so many
methodologies and approaches to properly
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizing and so again, incorporating a
healthy digestive system to your plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna kind of take the guesswork out of
that and make your investment in
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer that much better.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so these products are,
hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if I'm still echoing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just needed to mute Peter, you're fine,
Tony.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so all right, so let's say,
I'll close my eyes and I imagine we've got
[SPEAKER_15]: the right bacteria and the right organic
soil and we've got millions of little tiny
[SPEAKER_15]: hairs that are coming out of these roots
and now we've got more of these vessels
[SPEAKER_15]: and way to communicate and uptake that
information through the system in which
[SPEAKER_15]: you explained.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, and knowing what we know about the
plant now with the nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_15]: phosphorus, if there's ways to take
certain types of genetics, maximize or
[SPEAKER_15]: express and maybe target certain types of
boosting of terpene profiles, like maybe
[SPEAKER_15]: adding a certain mineral in that period
with that particular type of genetic
[SPEAKER_15]: instead of, is there a way, do you think
that that's what it's gonna come to is
[SPEAKER_15]: that we find this particular type of
genetic, we create this living type of
[SPEAKER_15]: soil that can maximize and boost the
properties in which we want?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably a Sam question,
but as far as what I feel about that is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cross breeding and it goes back to
biodynamic agriculture for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're taking a plant that shouldn't
necessarily be cultivated in the warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: or even a soil, we're deciding to put it
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you guys are doing with cross
breeding and things like that to express
[SPEAKER_01]: various genetic potentiality of the plant
in combination with something that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: been lacking for so long in this industry,
which is the biology that these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally co-evolved with in nature that
they're lacking in the warehouse or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that they never should have been
planted in in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, go ahead, Wayne.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to jump in for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm echoing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me mute myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think something you said is really
important that by having healthy soil,
[SPEAKER_11]: a full, to use a term, the soil food web,
if you will, and I think that's some of
[SPEAKER_11]: what you're doing not to mix labels or
anything, but the idea of having healthy
[SPEAKER_11]: soil, just to make it short, freeing me
from having to make choices about what I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna feed my plants when so that they can
flourish, giving them the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_11]: go looking for what they want and need and
being able to find it in abundance where
[SPEAKER_11]: they are, frees me from the responsibility
of sorting it out for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I've realized is that the different
genetics, they have different moments in
[SPEAKER_11]: their growth process.
[SPEAKER_11]: That thing you were talking about where
they go through the hormonal changes of
[SPEAKER_11]: ovulation and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was working indoors, I spent a lot
of time trying to understand what my
[SPEAKER_11]: plants needed when and how to feed them to
get them to express optimally what they
[SPEAKER_11]: were capable of.
[SPEAKER_11]: And working outdoors in healthy soil,
what I've found is that they take care of
[SPEAKER_11]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: All I'm trying to do is help them have
available everything they need and your
[SPEAKER_11]: product, I've not ever used it,
but I've read up on what you're doing and
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the concept.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's evocative of things I've read before
and I really think you're onto something
[SPEAKER_11]: where folks are not able to generate their
own inputs, but want to invest in
[SPEAKER_11]: something that will help their soil be
more alive, if you will.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to educate people
about how to help the colonies that you're
[SPEAKER_11]: giving them continue to flourish in their
gardens.
[SPEAKER_11]: But some of the best gardens I've been in
are far better than what I've been able to
[SPEAKER_11]: do here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in every one of them, those people
have spent years, more than seven usually,
[SPEAKER_11]: a number that someone else mentioned
earlier, where over the years they've just
[SPEAKER_11]: added to the soil, added to the soil,
added to the soil, nutrients and inputs
[SPEAKER_11]: from their farm or from their neighbors
where they know exactly what they're doing
[SPEAKER_11]: in terms of adding to the soil to see
benefit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Indra was speaking about rabbit manures.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the most beautiful gardens I've
seen this year is using goat, sheep,
[SPEAKER_11]: rabbit and chicken manures over a period
of years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And his trees, their trees are literally,
oh my goodness, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to exaggerate.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I've gone on a rant, but the point
that I'm trying to make is that point
[SPEAKER_11]: about me not having to choose what to feed
these plants over the course of their life
[SPEAKER_11]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I do is give them water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of takes the guesswork out of it,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you what, I'll send you a
bag of the soil balance so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's okay with Marcus, I'd love to,
since it's a good show, I'd love to give
[SPEAKER_01]: away 50 bags of our soil balance to his
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put a link to Nathan's email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the first maybe 50 people that
email Nathan, we'll give them a free bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of the soil balance so that everybody can
see how important biology is and how easy
[SPEAKER_01]: it can make cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're all about is trying
to help cultivators become more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable and utilize their budgets more
effectively and increase quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so it actually, if anybody wants
to email Nate at soilbalancepro.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll give 50 bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's cool, Marcus, like we didn't
talk about it before the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: but- No, you can't get bags of- It's
great, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are writing that email down
right now and trying to Well, describe
[SPEAKER_15]: what a bag does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 grams is what we're going to give
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give away 10, 10,
10 gram bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 50 bags that we're going to
give out and 10 grams will create 100
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons of microbial tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each gallon will, will contain 6
trillion microorganisms, all beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and each gallon will have
62 strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a 10 gram bag costs about $29,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the Canadian,
but we've set up to send our product into
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that will create 100 gallons of
microbe tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm really, really happy to learn more
about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm really paying attention and listen to
you guys and stuff, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_17]: jumped on board of that right away.
[SPEAKER_17]: Ordered my bag.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's in Canada is about 60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, no, it's, I'm looking forward to
actually utilizing your product.
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're so grateful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we really put a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put about 10 years into going around
the world and isolating strains from
[SPEAKER_01]: different ecosystems, like a rain forest
in a desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some strains from deserts that
will specifically to, to enhance and all
[SPEAKER_01]: they need is water to proliferate through
binary fission.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have an announcement that I'd like
to make during all this awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd as of about 20 minutes ago,
my partner, my friend, my brother from
[SPEAKER_06]: another mother, Claude Sayers in Jamaica,
uh, just had, uh, his, his girl just gave
[SPEAKER_06]: birth to, uh, to Savannah cannabis Sayers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome to the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Savannah cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are, uh, you are loved by many
already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations, Claude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's indeed welcome to the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit for her up, up, sent me the
picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, when was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like 15 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, that's amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just doing hash church and you're
watching kids be born.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't ignore that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now you can't stop doing hash church
now that we've got so many new members.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little, little Savannah cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name?
[SPEAKER_06]: Savannah cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Marcus, um, forest stopped by,
uh, my place the other day and he brought
[SPEAKER_11]: with him, uh, a little silver pen that had
said bubble man on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Had some really beautiful, um,
uh, I don't really like vape pens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really use them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I've had, I've tried a bunch of them
over the years and, um, that one I liked,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, yeah, it, it, it tasted like
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was actual flavor there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, um, but, uh, I really liked the
pen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who's doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that blue river or that is a
collaboration that we're all doing
[SPEAKER_06]: together, myself and Tony and,
uh, Gary from up tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Gary's, uh, a lot of the design and
then Tony and I are kind of R and D with
[SPEAKER_06]: the terpenes on blue river side with the
bubble man brand on my side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all kind of came up together and
created this, what we're now calling the
[SPEAKER_06]: Trinity, uh, which makes sense because
there are three substantial brands coming
[SPEAKER_06]: together to produce this one, uh,
brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's, it's been pretty cool,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh, Tony's definitely been,
you know, got to give him a mad big shout
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both him and Gary have put a ton.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of time and energy into this over the last
like 14 months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you're liking it, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, um, yeah, it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, like I said, never liked really big
pens, but that changed my opinion quite a
[SPEAKER_11]: bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks to the other person who,
uh, we'll make sure we get you one if he
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't leave it with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, uh, as you will, uh, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: He kept it cause he's loving it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he got, he got one for forest and
then I'll get you one.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make sure you get one.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, uh, we learned a lot of what is
wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants to be a part of hash church,
man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's just having it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, it's been two hours.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get attention.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but yeah, there's some things that we
learned, like, you know, with these
[SPEAKER_15]: particular, uh, with the tanks.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was talking about with the oil and THC
and there's like a lot of people trying to
[SPEAKER_15]: make them at home.
[SPEAKER_15]: So with anything new with new technology,
you try to, you know, push through
[SPEAKER_15]: different things and, and you're trying to
pioneer a way to get our organic oils,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, in a device that's healthy for you
that you can vaporize without knowing that
[SPEAKER_15]: you could reuse it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's the one that I would put my
name on as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: As myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and so, you know, it has this like,
um, it has a sick, uh, element in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, um, like a, um, a pumice stone,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, it basically, uh, under the,
under the tank, if you take the tank,
[SPEAKER_15]: she is just super upset.
[SPEAKER_15]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you take like the tank itself,
um, and if you just, if you get,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you're doing fresh frozen material,
making a bubble hash, and then pressing
[SPEAKER_15]: it, you're keeping it in, it's like almost
as raw THC as, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's raw as form.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's generally going to have a high
terpene content.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, uh, once you start getting past,
come on, really, once you start getting
[SPEAKER_15]: past, uh, 10 or 15%, especially as you get
closer to 30%, you're getting,
[SPEAKER_15]: you're getting, uh, you're getting this
breakout.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so not every terpene grouping does a
breakout.
[SPEAKER_15]: But say like strawberry banana goo
accelerates this breakout of THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you repend, when you look at any of
the posts that are taking like the rosin
[SPEAKER_15]: and the butter and there, and you're
repressing it at 130 degrees and you're
[SPEAKER_15]: separating the oil from the THCA and
you're getting like 97, 98, 99% THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you could see the two separations done
mechanically.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that happens inside the tank.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this is things that I've learned
and next week we're putting out like a
[SPEAKER_15]: whole comprehensive video of how to,
you know, use it from the start to finish.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's little tricks and trades that have
done it because terpenes in a live rosin
[SPEAKER_15]: form and the hash and everything being
organic and alive, it's what I call an
[SPEAKER_15]: active resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, it's not in its home anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's, it want, it's kind of volatile
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where it's like, I need to find a place.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if you mix up terpenes and you mix
up rosin and, uh, you just mix it up right
[SPEAKER_15]: away.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it, it needs time to settle and to
kind of either like market, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark Skaldone said, if the tie in
terpenaline, it's going to want to eat
[SPEAKER_15]: away at that rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's still, it's going to take some
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as it's doing that, there's a little
bit of organic chemistry happening there
[SPEAKER_15]: that it says, Hey, I need to find my way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm showing the pen right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, on screen share Tony, where the oil is
crystallizing in the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the little crystals that I've
got on the screen here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I've got one.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got one that, uh, so these are,
so this is an, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's creamy.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice and bright.
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you look at this oil,
guess which one's functioning better in
[SPEAKER_15]: the tank.
[SPEAKER_15]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you start to look at, uh, we did a
lemon tree one, um, and I did some
[SPEAKER_15]: different, uh, different types of,
uh, processes to dial this in.
[SPEAKER_15]: But ultimately, if you're going to use the
freshest, most raw, you know, live rosin
[SPEAKER_15]: sauce, if you will, um, and you have a
tank, then you put it in and you let it
[SPEAKER_15]: settle down and you use it right away.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you let it sit in there,
this thing will separate.
[SPEAKER_15]: The oil will come through the center pin,
like straight through that center hole,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is different than anything else.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't mind talking about this
because this is like, we're trying to get
[SPEAKER_15]: up a device that people can use and
understand, but it's amazing because under
[SPEAKER_15]: pressure, just pressure, the terpenes are
going to want to come out that hole.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I hit 15% in the first carts,
all of the terpenes came out of this
[SPEAKER_15]: center.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: A center device and left up here was THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: And everyone was like, well, that's a nice
magic trick, but I just wanted to smoke
[SPEAKER_15]: the oil that was inside it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am with you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what we found, um, is if you,
if you mix terpenes and rosin together and
[SPEAKER_15]: you, and I let it sit for like weeks,
like I'll do like 20, I'll do like 35
[SPEAKER_15]: grams to like, uh, to like three or four
milliliters.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like, now we found the magic
numbers about three drops and every drop
[SPEAKER_15]: is 2.25% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: On average, you should be able to hit 10,
11%.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel like with a 10, 11% terpene
content and a 77 to 75% overall
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabinoid profile, it's the best,
you know, potency to terpene.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not too crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what if you took that, uh,
where it's starting to crystallize there
[SPEAKER_12]: and just heated it gently with like a,
with like a hairdryer with the,
[SPEAKER_12]: with the, with the, I mean, again,
when I say heating it gently.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, I laughed because that's a tip
on our blog on the bubble band website
[SPEAKER_15]: using a hairdryer to gently heat it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but the reason why I was saying is
heating it gently because if it is THCA,
[SPEAKER_12]: now you can start decarboxylating it and
it's going to build up a little bit of
[SPEAKER_12]: pressure, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, but what we don't want is we don't
want our oil to separate inside the tanks.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we, what we found is yes, we want to
have this like experience of having the
[SPEAKER_15]: freshest taste that you can, but you also
need the function.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so my, there's a bunch of people on
the, on Instagram, I was going to talk
[SPEAKER_15]: about this today is so if you're mixing
distillate or you're mixing, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: any kind of extract with terpenes,
you need to give it several days to kind
[SPEAKER_15]: of find its way, mix it really well,
let it sit three to five days.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, make sure that there's no off gassing
or bubbles or a volatile type of oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then when you put it into the tank,
or if you're mixing it right away and,
[SPEAKER_15]: and you just want to be impatient and you
put it into the tank, if you leave it if
[SPEAKER_15]: you leave it with the lid off,
I have these little trays and if you leave
[SPEAKER_15]: it with the lid off for 24 hours with the
lid off itself, like that sauce you just
[SPEAKER_15]: saw me put in here, I'm waiting for it to
go down.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you leave it with the lid off,
not like this, but if you put it in here
[SPEAKER_15]: and you leave it with the lid off and you
wait 24 hours, what happens is the,
[SPEAKER_15]: the sick stone, if you will, in there
absorbs all of the oil in its,
[SPEAKER_15]: in its entirety as one unit and,
and leaves a, um, I wouldn't say a harder
[SPEAKER_15]: level, but it leaves a nice like kind of
custard level at the top.
[SPEAKER_15]: You put your pen on and then they never
leak and then they, they hit perfectly and
[SPEAKER_15]: consistently and they never separate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Custard, you say?
[SPEAKER_15]: Custard.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it creates, it creates, this is like
weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some custard.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it, and it creates a, uh, consistent
oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: If not just a little bit of pressure,
which led, is going to lead me to like
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of another idea, which is using a,
a device that creates pressure from
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenes to do the separation instead of
an actual press.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, if you don't, if you don't use it
right away and you let that sit,
[SPEAKER_15]: that could separate on you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and so what we found was if you took,
uh, what Skaldon was saying is if you take
[SPEAKER_15]: the, the, uh, say if you, you know,
took a, um, a live rosin or you took a,
[SPEAKER_15]: um, flower rosin and there was a gentle,
uh, heat like 105 or 110 degrees to just
[SPEAKER_15]: gently, um, warm up the extract,
even if it was just 10% and, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, slightly activated 10 or 20%,
then you get in.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then when you get back into it,
you end up getting more of a gel,
[SPEAKER_15]: which kind of looks like, uh, maybe the
old CO2 days, but literally every single
[SPEAKER_15]: thing will come off this pen.
[SPEAKER_15]: This was just laying sideways.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it literally works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's that trade-off.
[SPEAKER_15]: This one was, this one was almost halfway
activated.
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn,
[SPEAKER_06]: I wondered what that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony sounds different now.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of a sudden I was just like not paying
attention for half a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Indra came in.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was literally in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, what a trip.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I, uh, long story short, you know,
uh, terpenes help break out THCA.
[SPEAKER_15]: It helps break out CBD.
[SPEAKER_15]: It helps break out different elements.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also helps me get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find it's a very important component of
feeling properly elevated from a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to interrupt you, go on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just trying to help people out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say one thing about that pen here
and right now and forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not plug it in with the, with the,
with the cart attached to the battery.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a no-no.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if anything with the audience that's
listening, don't ever plug it in like
[SPEAKER_15]: this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Always remove the tank from the battery.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's an, it's a newer type of battery.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a 14 watt sub-ohm.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, it's, uh, it will, it will heat
up your oil very quickly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's put it that way and could
potentially, um, catch fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's safe.
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the pen retail?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, $5,000 right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very conscious.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 62 bucks.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's $62 retail.
[SPEAKER_15]: Retail for an empty and you, uh,
we were selling like Gary, selling the
[SPEAKER_15]: little 10 drop vials with the whole app
applicator and everything so people can
[SPEAKER_15]: make them at home.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, you know, even for us,
we're, we're, we're selling them with the
[SPEAKER_15]: oil in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were trying to get everything down
to like a live rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, um, but in that process we
learned, you know, filling the tanks up
[SPEAKER_15]: and not letting them kind of sit in there,
uh, for a 24 hour period would start to
[SPEAKER_15]: have the oils would want to separate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, that's really just a tip.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if you're at home and you're
going to use it right away, no problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you were going to, if you were
going to try to keep it for, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_15]: a week or two weeks, um, you want to let
it sit in the pen before you put the top
[SPEAKER_15]: on for just the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys wouldn't mind if I,
if I changed the subject real quick,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I know I'm kind of like a new friend
of the group, but one of the things I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of feeling right now,
is, uh, you know, every time Marcus says
[SPEAKER_01]: something, like I laugh my ass off and
it's usually so well articulated and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, insightful and, uh, just, just joyous
to me, man, in my, in my whole field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since I've got this, this, this,
this little bit of space, and since
[SPEAKER_01]: there's such a collective people,
I was just wondering if we could all maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: use the time in a, in a church like
fashion to kind of send, uh, Marcus some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some deep gratitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some deep appreciation for all that he
has done and given of himself,
[SPEAKER_01]: of his time, of his energy, of his
consciousness, uh, to all of us and just
[SPEAKER_01]: really be so grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's what I'm sending to you,
my friend as a new friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so with that being said,
I'm going to go hang out with my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so grateful, like deeply humbled to
be, uh, on such a panel with, with great
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators and growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the stewards and protectors
of our lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the light beings that,
that, that we support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so thank you guys and thank you for
having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Soil Balance Pro for kicking down
50 bags for those of you that haven't sent
[SPEAKER_06]: your email.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Nate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Nate's in the chat room right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he'll put his email up again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just saw him in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very, very generous kick down 50,
10 gram bags of Soil Balance Pro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trillions of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kicking down the trillions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's generous.
[SPEAKER_06]: When your generosity gets into the
trillions, whatever it is you're dealing
[SPEAKER_06]: with, that's, uh, I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going, Andrea?
[SPEAKER_09]: So Marcus, um, I did a little experiment
this weekend, which I think, uh,
[SPEAKER_09]: may be of interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your head put on a glandular
trichrome body?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I, I decided to become a trichrome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the only way I can stay high.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just gave in and became a
trichrome myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hang out with trichromes now and that's
just the way we do it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, as far as the treating of your
oil to work in the pens, a very good way
[SPEAKER_09]: to do it is to stick it in a vacuum oven,
set the oven for 130 degrees and run it
[SPEAKER_09]: for about 38 or 40 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then your stuff will run in the pen
like water after that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll all drain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll all work really good is to be all
end off, cure off for your pen problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where would the terpenes go?
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't go anywhere because you only
run it 135 degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll just stay right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Low vacuum and they just stay right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Michael Manning?
[SPEAKER_10]: Andrea, I just wanted to mention that I
have a patent on, uh, putting my face on,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, ResinHeads.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you patented that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what you're doing is you, you,
you owe me exactly 23 cents.
[SPEAKER_10]: You owe me 23 cents at this moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll send it right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, the other thing, the other
thing is, uh, what I think is a good piece
[SPEAKER_09]: of noses.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took four plants, I cut them down and
within 10 minutes I put them in the
[SPEAKER_09]: extractor and I extracted them and the
results are truly, truly, truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have never smoked oil this strong in my
life.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the best stuff I've ever imbibed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so strong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: It smells like a fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: It tastes like it when you smoke it,
it tastes like a brand new fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's absolutely delicious and uh it's you
can pull out huge, huge, huge uh uh things
[SPEAKER_09]: with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the most beautiful oil and I
would say after trying this uh that made,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is a new product I think that
nobody's really making on the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's absolutely fresh.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: The oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I BHO'd it 20 minutes after I cut the
plant down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you did the live.
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.
[SPEAKER_09]: Truly live.
[SPEAKER_09]: And uh I got some, I got a drop of it
freezing on a drop of water in the
[SPEAKER_09]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna try to see if I can make a to
see if it'll make a picture or if it'll,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, crystallize out on the in the
thaw out period.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've mentioned that before with living
oils that we made in the past from many
[SPEAKER_09]: other plants, not pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't try making it a pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm gonna be trying that with it to
take a look at this live resin but I have
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody who's come over, nobody has been
able to take more than one good hit off of
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm thinking this stuff will also work
really nicely in the pen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got one of those pens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the beauty of the pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put your own **** in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't wanna put out a pen that was
like locked to our, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, it has to, you know, you have to get
the oil every time from those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no, you gotta be able to put
your own material in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm definitely with you on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think uh being able to put your own
stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I extracted a very fresh one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to see if I could get around the
long heat treatment or the long low vacuum
[SPEAKER_09]: treatment to make it a little bit of work
in the pen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the oils work in the pen if you do
them in the vacuum oven for 48 hours at a
[SPEAKER_09]: very low heat and uh not not a full
vacuum, you know, a gentle vacuum.
[SPEAKER_09]: After that, they'll pour and they'll pour
into a pen but this fresh extraction was
[SPEAKER_09]: is truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish you were uh across the border man
because I would I'd love to see you take a
[SPEAKER_09]: talk of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you, if I only had five cents
for each time, someone said, I wish you
[SPEAKER_06]: could come down to the US.
[SPEAKER_15]: I say it three times a day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every day, three times a day for 158
episodes, seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, we're letting people in who come and
bomb us and shoot us and kill us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we let Marcus in for he all he
wants to do is stone us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll even like, I'll be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do whatever like, I'll follow the
rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm uh you know, aside from cannabis,
here's the funny thing like aside from
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, I'm not like a huge rule
breaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: My rule breaking always has to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, I'm gonna grow it and I'm
gonna smoke it and I'm gonna smoke it at
[SPEAKER_06]: like concerts and indoors and I'm gonna
smoke it like everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna smoke it everywhere I go and
so uh I do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just got the new waterproof edition so
you could smoke it in the uh shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just totally kidding.
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be funny, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Underwater and in the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's bubble man into America.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the hard.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's hard to see what you got in your
hand, Indra.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a nectar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an electric model and it it you can
get a cloud of smoke from this puppy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a nectar collector given to me a
couple years ago by D Nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the one that you don't heat up
with the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a coil around it so you just
plugged it in.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what he's got.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got he's got an electric one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a battery powered model though and uh
you don't need a plug.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can carry it with shows with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I hit it a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like this thing is just like crazy
like especially cuz you hit like giant
[SPEAKER_06]: bowls of of product like you can just put
that thing right into your jar of hash and
[SPEAKER_06]: just be like that's a dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it was for me for the little bit
that I was getting into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go through a lot of concentrate
with one in a day's time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I guess it is Canadian Thanksgiving
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, happy Thanksgiving to all the
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, tomorrow this weekend, you know,
Monday, Thanksgiving, Sunday, many
[SPEAKER_06]: Canadians will be sitting down for the
Thanksgiving dinner and uh so yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everyone has a good Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope all the well, I hope that the hash
is melty that people pull out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's like not this like really bad
third world import swag.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like not the best product they
could have made you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is Thanksgiving in Canada
about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um thankful for you know, not being an
American.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to congratulate you on your
years of house church bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's uh we're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just sitting around and kind of
laughing and it's actually been a pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: good conversation today but it has indeed
been three years and that is kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me feel old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Went by awfully quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you do get older, time goes by so much
quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's highly unfair but true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're we're we're alive and
we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's the lesson I get in life
every time from um losing my father at a
[SPEAKER_06]: young age.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was fifty-five.
[SPEAKER_06]: My stepmom was forty-nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were killed in an in an accident in a
motorcycle accident and whenever I hear
[SPEAKER_06]: people kind of being like, oh,
you know, this getting old thing like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, beats the alternative, you know,
being dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of like, oh, **** yeah,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it really does beat the alternative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being alive no matter how old you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you believe in reincarnation,
you'll get a nice friend like a new young
[SPEAKER_10]: bod.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you come back as a leper on the streets
of India.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a bit terrifying too.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've been a schmuck, you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you didn't believe in
reincarnation.
[SPEAKER_10]: I absolutely do not but you know,
there's a lot of folks out there who do.
[SPEAKER_06]: He believes in deserving.
[SPEAKER_06]: He believes in just desserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't have to believe in
reincarnation to believe in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I like coming in.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got it patented.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got it patented.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to press up a bunch of
rosin today but I'm not sure if I'm going
[SPEAKER_05]: to continue that or not.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been wanting to make cash for like a
month and a half but then I broke the rib.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I'm definitely going to pull out your
bags, dude and we're going to wash some
[SPEAKER_17]: resin today.
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you going to church and thank you so
much for your last 158 Sundays of your
[SPEAKER_17]: life.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm doing it with you.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've ran across airports to make sure
you've gotten this episode going,
[SPEAKER_17]: sped down rows, gotten through hotels,
screeched in the side things.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm being with you a long way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Created internet connections when we
didn't have them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, I think the best one by far was
landing at the airport Sunday morning in
[SPEAKER_06]: Toronto and then jumping into Claude's car
with three other Rastafarians and it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: blizzard and we're driving to Brampton,
Ontario and I'm in the back seat and this,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Bobo's driving straight blizzard
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, this is fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I've got like 18 minutes to make it
rain.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they drive the same way whether there's
a blizzard out or... Dude, listen,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was exactly the same way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was completely psychotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobo was kind of getting mad because I was
like, dude, like, do you understand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I need to do this show and I can't
be dead when I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to be alive and conscious.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem, Bobo Mac.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get you there, blood.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Bobo's defense, he absolutely got
me there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the shortest hash church we ever
did because the internet ended up cacking
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we got 17 minutes that episode of
the hash church.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember the one in the grill where we
could only find one spot on the corner
[SPEAKER_15]: post?
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_15]: And people had to share the spot.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was little chairs that were built
out of wood.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, oh, what's this?
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're like, well, we better sit here
early.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, well, sit down.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to secure our internet position
and we just hold it down right there in
[SPEAKER_15]: that one foot by one foot spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took it further.
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked a few people if they wouldn't mind
not going online while we were using the
[SPEAKER_06]: internet because we were streaming
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, no problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: And trying to explain hash church in two
sentences is tough.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, what's it for, Mon?
[SPEAKER_15]: And that one guy, you were like,
well, it's for hash church.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, hash church.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, yeah, hash church.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's like, oh.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's always that moment where
they're like, it just doesn't compute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's two strange words to put
together, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, I always got to shout out
Amir.
[SPEAKER_06]: My good buddy, Amir, who had a restaurant
across from me at the melting point called
[SPEAKER_06]: Rime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where we did the original
church.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so after 20 years go by, and it's
much, much hash, and everything's about
[SPEAKER_06]: hash, the stream had to be named hash
church.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really kind of the birth of hash
church.
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube letting me stream Amir and my
friends gathering on Sundays for what we
[SPEAKER_06]: just called church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back then, it was still the prohibition
land.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we weren't going to call it cannabis
church or weed church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or anything that made it stand out that we
could be talking about it and then get
[SPEAKER_06]: ourselves into trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that quickly changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we are, hash church every Sunday
for the last three years and a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Minus one, I was camping.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how about a shout out to Roger
Waters?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's coming to town in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where you guys are all from.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you hear that us and them is coming
to your town, I would definitely not miss
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely going to be like a
serious, serious experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buddy sets the bar pretty high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it goes beyond just any
concert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm quite excited to be going to both
nights in Vancouver on the 28th and 29th
[SPEAKER_06]: of October this month.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never get to go do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a father of a three-year-old and
teenagers, I'm stoked to go out and be at
[SPEAKER_06]: a concert and just enjoy some Roger
Waters, some Pink Floyd vibes.
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I could join you.
[SPEAKER_15]: They just started talking about the
obscurity in the show with how it's
[SPEAKER_15]: relating to Trump in the news,
if you haven't noticed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember when I went and I told you,
I was like, hey, bros.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, oh, yeah, you went to Pink
Floyd.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm getting ready to go there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And afterwards, it was just a whole
different experience because I wasn't
[SPEAKER_15]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_15]: An entire concert and campaign to be
geared up bashing the president in a.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, with with shots along the way,
like you're like, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a guy that wrote a whole album
about his mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's holding a grudge.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, right, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's giant filled with pigs in the air,
like floating around.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's cities built around it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like even when the money song came on,
you're like, OK, a classic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like money is back and forth and like it's
still like has references to the Kremlin
[SPEAKER_15]: and Trump.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it's it's pretty, pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Political, it's political.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's a pretty powerful political,
you know, voice in that whole realm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, what he's saying is not is
not what people want to be hearing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So or at least certain people and other
people want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Michael, I want to just pop on here
if it is the last one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to smoke a bowl on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never see anybody smoking a bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep it old school for the most part.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I work with all these wonderful
extracts and everything, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's how I started.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I go to when I ate.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's got a bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm smoking a bowl on that church.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I love the like the way you guys
look split perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the mic was right in the middle of
the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys both got the black shirts,
the bald head, the fucking the nice
[SPEAKER_06]: headphones.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony had me go get the headphones so we
could try this dual headphones.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I've had them for 158 episodes and
not every once.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I did dual headset with Steve D
'Angelo, but it was so loud we didn't get
[SPEAKER_15]: to to use it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I told him, I was like, man,
I got the mic.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got the headsets.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, really?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, yeah, I get the headset.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had Steve D'Angelo on Hash Church
and he never said a word.
[SPEAKER_06]: We watched you guys on mute the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this isn't the last one.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the This Is It tour.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this starts the This Is It.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the the the latest final tour.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this is this is basically the first
final basically what this is.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Hash Church with no makeup.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might do a whole makeup tour.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Hash Church live on stage.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's gone 158 episodes.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gone on unbelievably in all
locations.
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes a man needs a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so a family needs Sundays.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what's he saying?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to stop the broadcast on that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for coming out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see you next time.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_16]: There'll never be another time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: As Church is breaking down from its sober
foundations, we have to get right back on
[SPEAKER_10]: the track.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what I wanted to do was I wanted
to stop all this cannabis ridiculousness
[SPEAKER_06]: and start Booze Church, because let's be
honest, booze is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good for the children.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody ever said that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes my pain away right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes my pain away.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to have 10 million viewers,
start Booze and Football Church.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what you should do is just have
Hash Church and Review Football.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to change it to Boobs Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will actually give us more viewers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think that we'll have any of
our respected, esteemed colleagues showing
[SPEAKER_06]: up anymore, like Hilary Black or Dr.
Natasha.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: They wouldn't do it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be like, sorry,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost all respect for everything you
were doing when you started Booze Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, I think on that note,
we should also pay some serious respect to
[SPEAKER_15]: the ladies because I think one of the top
10 best episodes is when there was all
[SPEAKER_15]: women's Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Top five.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Top three.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty impressive because it was
like CNN took over Hash Church with all of
[SPEAKER_15]: these like professional broadcasters,
researchers, doctors, and really made us
[SPEAKER_15]: all look a little just kind of like we're
barely holding it together, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, even the way every single one was
framed perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you didn't see tons of shit
behind them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all had like these perfect frames
like they were like news anchors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, holy shit, ladies are crushing
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But and then it was the but not only that,
it was the amount of information per
[SPEAKER_15]: square inch, if you will.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when we talk about lumens,
it was there wasn't a slow draw or we had
[SPEAKER_15]: to come to a conclusion together or like
we like talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect segues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: No interruptions, no interruptions and
just full on machine gun information.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it was like we're live here down in
down in Mexico after the earthquake.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go here.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like it was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the amount of information that got
pushed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was like an incredible unity.
[SPEAKER_15]: And people need to need to understand that
the future of cannabis is going to have a
[SPEAKER_15]: lot of women in it and it should.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it brings a good harmony between
two approaches of our industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: But hats off to the women that did that
episode.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the best Hash Churches.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already full of a lot of women.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the best growers that I have met
in the past two or three years have been
[SPEAKER_09]: women.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some women have turned me under some of
the best buds I've ever had my hands on,
[SPEAKER_09]: including back in Vietnam days.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wasn't even going to grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave up last year because I,
you know, I'm getting old and it gets hard
[SPEAKER_09]: to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this year I grew a dozen plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way do you see the one it looks
like somebody spray painted it with
[SPEAKER_09]: glitter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I use my years long scenario to do it
with rabbit poo.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's rabbit poo and rabbit poo tea with
the only additives in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just we smoked one last night and it
just puts you in another headspace.
[SPEAKER_09]: You smoked rabbit poo last night or what
did you literally, I guess, because the
[SPEAKER_09]: rabbit poo made the terpenes and it made
the trichrome heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what I was burning.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I was I was having rabbit poo
red.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, there's some of my stuff in the
background there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You like it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, when you're putting your oil real
quick, I did want to say this because this
[SPEAKER_15]: is really important.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you put the oil in the pen,
John, or anybody that's out there,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, just like when you're hitting a
bong, you would you would pull,
[SPEAKER_15]: then you would light your bowl,
then you would hit your bong, then you
[SPEAKER_15]: would clear it and you would never leave
like a stale bong.
[SPEAKER_15]: So like the same thing with this is you
want to pull, press, get whatever hit you
[SPEAKER_15]: want, let go, clear it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when and when you're if you use your
finger, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_15]: But whatever size your hit is.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for oil, especially when you're using
live resin, like a VHL, something that's
[SPEAKER_15]: real runny, you have to be able to let the
tank cool down and do that by putting your
[SPEAKER_15]: finger here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's still warm to the touch,
don't hit it again.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just pull cool air through it just over
and over until it's cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there were people that were using that
these tanks for the for like live resins
[SPEAKER_15]: and, you know, 20 and 30 percent oils and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're hitting it over and over and
over.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the tank will run hot.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not like a wick.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a wicking system.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to let you know that
before, in case this was there's a hole in
[SPEAKER_15]: the bottom you have to be conscious of.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just got to be conscious of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like everything in nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a hole in the bottom that stuff
drains out of.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the stuff's too thick, it don't
drain.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, mine is always if you do it exactly
like that, you'll always have a clean
[SPEAKER_15]: bottom, you know, just like always clean.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always pull cool air through it every
time after every hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what mom said.
[SPEAKER_09]: She was teaching us about wiping about the
clean bottom.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Life is a clean bottom.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me tell you, Tony, if you run it
in the vacuum of 48 hours at 135,
[SPEAKER_09]: you will be amazed.
[SPEAKER_15]: This one.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what that is right there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's a totally different oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like a low heat, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done it quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know it's a very good method.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've got especially resistant
oil, like sometimes when you do BHO,
[SPEAKER_09]: you'll get it come out and it'll look like
an iceberg or it'll just be solid as a
[SPEAKER_09]: rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you raise it to 149 degrees for the
48 hours and it'll get motile again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Indra, have you checked out that new
Ken Burns documentary?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're always mentioning Vietnam
and your time in Vietnam, the new Vietnam
[SPEAKER_07]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just started watching it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've seen any of his
other documentaries, but it's intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's it's I mean, if you were there,
I was there for 31 months.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a combat field medic.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm never in a hurry to see pictures
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got about 2000 pictures, 35 million.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a kilometer that I brought back
from Vietnam with me over.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've never looked at them once.
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought them back and I gave them to my
mom and she put them in a box.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never felt like I wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even want to look at the pictures
of my friends because every single person
[SPEAKER_09]: I was with there died there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was the one person who went in a company
and got back out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I've never felt drawn.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I look at that stuff, it's like
something gets stiff inside of me,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, because going through that
experience, I think what saved me and made
[SPEAKER_09]: me not crazy and not want to kill myself
like so many guys did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when you came back, the country
didn't accept the responsibility for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They left it on the shoulders of the
veterans.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so a lot of them started killing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: But soon after I came back, I picked up
some hippies hitchhiking and they took me
[SPEAKER_09]: to a party where they were passing out
LSD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was there for about a week high on
LSD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And afterwards, I thought to myself,
well, Vietnam, that's a memory now,
[SPEAKER_09]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't really, I don't look to
re-experience it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of my way of dealing with it was
finding my center in the universe that
[SPEAKER_09]: weekend, tripping on acid.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I truly did find my, we were at a
house in the Hollywood Hills, three story
[SPEAKER_09]: house, and they brought me in on the
bottom floor, gave us acid.
[SPEAKER_09]: I start passing out Vietnam joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody was really plastered.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I ended up on the third floor and
everybody was talking about their first
[SPEAKER_09]: acid trips and I hadn't had one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they made sure that I did have one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a dome on the roof up there and
you could see it at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Never forget it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that memory sort of supersedes the
Vietnam stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I can remember guys in Vietnam on guard
duty taking acid, which I didn't,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, that wasn't something that I was
interested in doing there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did smoke probably two bales of
marijuana while I was there, hay-sized
[SPEAKER_09]: bales of marijuana at least.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sent a lot back to my mom in
Panasonic and Sanrio refrigerators because
[SPEAKER_09]: they didn't have customs in those days and
you could send anything directly back.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did have customs, but if you were on
a combat soldier, you didn't have to go
[SPEAKER_09]: through customs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your mail went direct.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I started sending my mom Sanrio
refrigerators packed with Buddhist stick
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, one of the seeds,
one of the plants that I grew this year is
[SPEAKER_09]: the one that has these amazing crack
homes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're even on the bottom of the leaf,
as thick as they are on the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: You look on my Instagram account,
I've been posting pictures of this
[SPEAKER_09]: particular leaves and plants on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a green one, but it's covered with
trichomes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen the trichomes so thick on
the bottom and the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish bubble man was here because I'd
like to take some buds out of this
[SPEAKER_09]: particular stuff and make bubble hash out
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: The trichomes are just thick as flies
everywhere all over it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was one of the seeds that I
brought back and it was a random seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked out, I just stuck my hand in the
little jar that I've got, pulled this one
[SPEAKER_09]: seed out and there it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't make any cuttings out of it
or anything either, sadly, but such is
[SPEAKER_09]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such is life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such is life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you take cuts off everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes she gets lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other times I'm so desperate, you bring
her back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put some male teeth on one of the bottom
branches on it, but even then it's going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be a different kind of a plant that the
seed will be.
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be the same plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, maybe we'll see.
[SPEAKER_09]: True.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what a heavy heart this last day.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I understand, you know, you've made a
long, long sacrifice in behalf of everyone
[SPEAKER_09]: else's consciousness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the best things I ever heard
from a guru in my life, which would be a
[SPEAKER_09]: good thing for you, was I was struggling
at the time learning anatomy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my teacher said to me, if you want to
learn a thing, teach it and you'll hear
[SPEAKER_09]: every question there is and you'll learn
it more thoroughly than any other person
[SPEAKER_09]: could have taught you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what you've done,
Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've taught and in that teaching,
you've learned yourself a great deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't deny that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've definitely learned a lot sitting here
and listening to everyone talk and being a
[SPEAKER_06]: part of the conversations for the last
three years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have definitely learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming out this end with a lot more
knowledge than I went into it for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I love about it, just like
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit, I've learned so much from Ash Church
and everyone that's been on this panel and
[SPEAKER_17]: all the viewers and all the people that
input everything from when we started
[SPEAKER_17]: learning the static dry sifting when Dee
was doing the carding and Triculture's
[SPEAKER_17]: taking on the back of the iTunes card and
just how everything just kind of there's
[SPEAKER_17]: all these little steps and all these
little things that have happened over the
[SPEAKER_17]: years with everybody that's been involved
and all the other people.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been pretty awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had a fantastic time.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit, we've learned.
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody here has learned.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been one of the best things that's
happened for me over the last three years
[SPEAKER_17]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: Meeting you, my brother, is another thing
that's made this fantastic part of life
[SPEAKER_17]: here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace out to Bingo Lombardi who's
splitting chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to hang out on his birthday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good birthday, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the Renaissance Fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be probably kind of trippy.
[SPEAKER_17]: All over the world, the people that are in
chat.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's everybody at in chat?
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell us where you're from right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where are we from?
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's everybody from?
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are tripping in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, oh my God, is this the last
Ash Church ever?
[SPEAKER_06]: I never said that it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just said that I might stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to try and organize and get
everyone excited about a conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been all these little blows that
have occurred over the years, and Ash
[SPEAKER_06]: Church doesn't get quite the views that it
used to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably getting half the amount of
views that it used to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were all things that I took into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we're not just doing it for
views, but I like the idea of knowing that
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands, tens of thousands of people
were seeing an episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if we do an episode, we might get
five, six thousand views over the course
[SPEAKER_06]: of a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't by any means.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good idea that Tony had,
so if we don't come back, we did a wrap up
[SPEAKER_06]: episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went through some of the history and
some of the important conversations that
[SPEAKER_06]: we had.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, this serves a lot of different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a girl who does a channel called
Digging Brit, where she's got a super
[SPEAKER_09]: voluptuous body and she barely wears
anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: She goes around with a metal detector and
a spoon, and she gets a million hits a
[SPEAKER_09]: week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those million people who hit on that show
are there for one reason, to see Digging
[SPEAKER_09]: Brit bending over and digging with the
spoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, the five or six thousand people that
see it are people that figure in to our
[SPEAKER_09]: society and to our culture in a big way.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not just getting people here who are
googling our DNA.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that five thousand viewers are
a lot more important in this particular
[SPEAKER_09]: case than a million viewers who are there
just watching somebody's body.
[SPEAKER_15]: You mean overall influence, the spread.
[SPEAKER_06]: The overall influence that this show has.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not going to take the old
churches down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's like, oh, don't take the videos
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the videos are up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there to stay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if YouTube ever decided to take
them down, I'd put them up on the bubble
[SPEAKER_06]: man brand dot com website and people could
go watch them over there like they're
[SPEAKER_06]: they're they're secured.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're good to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: The past will never be lost in that sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the future is the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens next Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if people have ideas and want to
talk about things, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, it's just I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you like go through and have some
crazy dude edit, like edit, like go back
[SPEAKER_15]: and like edit like a series and take out
like all of key important conversations
[SPEAKER_15]: and discussions and chat to do with
basketball games.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the whole basketball game in five
minutes this week on the hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, came out swinging hard this week on
the hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were puffing terp sauce nine minutes
into the episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's like nine minutes, nine minutes
and thirty two.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wade goes off on, you know, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like pull all these key moments.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, because it's a lot of footage.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like anything else.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is filmed live.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then like if you film anything in life
live, you edit, you know, you get like you
[SPEAKER_15]: edit it down.
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe somebody out there wants to start
editing the hash collection so you could
[SPEAKER_15]: keep it, you know, and you know,
to edit it all out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which he did would you suggest since we
have such a poor set of crazy dudes
[SPEAKER_15]: available to us, it's going to take years.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that way what can happen is it's the
the legacy edit edit versions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody would have to work on that for
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm surprised nobody's doing it already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the people are definitely downloading
them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What people would really notice is if this
conversation stopped, they would notice
[SPEAKER_06]: like, oh, weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, where do you go to find this shit
out now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, where do you go to like kind of have
this cutting edge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, trust me, it's not like the
scene's going to stop all this stuff still
[SPEAKER_06]: going to keep happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just been really neat that it's been
happening in this little circle of people
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been really pushing and
promoting it, pushing the envelope on a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of these different conversations from
soil grown with with Roz and from,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Tony and Horatio with the
terpenes and, you know, with all of us,
[SPEAKER_06]: with all of our different areas of
expertise.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been interesting, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there'd be a lot less people making
good bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, I've been getting really good
bubble hash from Eureka for sixty to
[SPEAKER_09]: eighty dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really light, beautiful, really crazy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I press it in my Tarik X little
tiny press to make fresh rosin with it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the most beautiful bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it's like it's almost like a
sponge.
[SPEAKER_09]: You pick it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing just softens.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the ones that start melting in
your hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Melts in your bowl, not in your hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it melts in your mind, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of it this year because
there's going to be a lot of pot because a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of people started growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: California is rife with pot right now and
it's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see some price drops this
year as all these crops come due.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for some reason or other, it seems
like everybody's going to be having a
[SPEAKER_09]: bumper crop at the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked to a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been to a couple of farms and men.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything looks like gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, mister Harlequin,
I have got a well, I've got a little stash
[SPEAKER_09]: of pure CBD oil for you and for uh for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh a pint maybe and it's it's uh what a
blessing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went I winterized it and it's absolutely
clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got all the paperwork from SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every test could do was done on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing but the it's just the good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got 0.04 THC in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh what a blessing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh I, I, does Forest know how to get a
hold of you, Indra?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know but I, Indra went away at
Yahoo will get a hold of me really easy.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I've got the website.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pure Extracts Inc.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pure Extracts Inc.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look for an email from Wade at House of
Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh I want to get it to you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's about a pint and it's really
beautiful stuff and let me tell you,
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been using it myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got two titanium cages in my back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been using it since being wounded in
Vietnam and um sometimes they cause me a
[SPEAKER_09]: tremendous amount of pain and limit my
mobility and I've been taking about an
[SPEAKER_09]: eighth of a teaspoon in the morning and
one at night of this CBD oil and really
[SPEAKER_09]: been pain free.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I just, I get up, walk around,
I forgot to take my cane with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to town.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went shopping all because I've had this
particular CBD for the past month and a
[SPEAKER_09]: half and uh it has it, I can't describe it
but it's a tremendous feeling of
[SPEAKER_09]: well-being that I get within just 10 or 15
minutes of, I just get my plastic spoon in
[SPEAKER_09]: it and I get an eighth of a teaspoon out,
put it in my mouth on my tongue and
[SPEAKER_09]: swallow it and 15 minutes later,
I feel, I feel like I want to go do
[SPEAKER_09]: something like I, I'm not thinking,
well, gee, if I go out, am I going to run
[SPEAKER_09]: out of energy or am I going to be,
have to sit somewhere and rest and recover
[SPEAKER_09]: from my back?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just go and do it and I think this CBD
oil for some reason is very potent and uh
[SPEAKER_09]: that's why I really want to get it to
Mars.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I, if it can help me not feel
the pain that I live with daily,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more, you know, I think it must be
good for those kids and uh so anyway,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh I get it really cheap by the kilo.
[SPEAKER_09]: I winterize it and I got a pint of it for
you and it's just thank you Andrea.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does the job.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does the job and uh it will bless many
people's lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll use it for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope a panel lasts you for a
while.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll I'll get some more but winterizing
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's uh 90% of it is is plant fat and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you get a 10% yield of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a lot of plant fat.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like 10.8% pure CBD but I don't mind
doing it for those kids.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'll wait to a mile a month to
help some kids feel better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the feeling and I'm glad
you're getting benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of the way I experienced
dosing with CBD is it's it's not really
[SPEAKER_11]: about a buzz so much as just a sense of
well-being.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe the difference it makes in
my everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes my attitude, makes how I feel,
how I'm dealing with other people.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in pain all the time,
you're always biting that back,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and I believe me, II was in pain
uh since 1968 when I got wounded,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I've been in pain ever since
then until now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's one of the things that's kept
me alive because I've never been
[SPEAKER_09]: comfortable enough to die but
[SPEAKER_09]: this CBD uh has brought me great comfort
and solace.
[SPEAKER_09]: II couldn't believe in the beginning,
I was a bit you know, like everybody was
[SPEAKER_09]: like, I was like, well, I haven't seen any
evidence of that yet but um this is the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time I got a hold of any in a pure
in a pure quantity and uh other than some
[SPEAKER_09]: other chemicals that the guys give me from
uh field extracts all the time when I go
[SPEAKER_09]: by their booth and that gave me a relief
too but this stuff, this oil, a quarter
[SPEAKER_09]: teaspoon of it and then an hour later,
you feel like Mother Teresa on a good day.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just dispensing love.
[SPEAKER_09]: You feel so much better.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, it's not a it's not a high.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a it's a high of state of mind
because your endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_09]: beaming energy back to your brain because
that's where it's all connected to and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's saying, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: We got stash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh yeah II think of uh tell you a funny
little thing about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um I think of most most cultures have some
sort of psychoactive substance that they
[SPEAKER_11]: consume.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it's alcohol sometimes it's
tobacco sometimes it's mushrooms sometimes
[SPEAKER_11]: it's cactus sometimes it's vines sometimes
it's roots but pretty much every culture
[SPEAKER_11]: has some sort of psychoactive thing they
get up to and one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting is virtually all of those
cultures have shamans or guides who take
[SPEAKER_11]: the initiates into that process of a
psychoactivity and I think cannabis is one
[SPEAKER_11]: of the plants that we use for its
psychoactivity uh but part of what
[SPEAKER_11]: happened over the years is that by
breeding just for psychoactivity we bred
[SPEAKER_11]: out cvd and cvd was kind of the built-in
shaman that was supposed to come along for
[SPEAKER_11]: the ride I think back when I first smoked
cannabis uh it had cvd in it it was
[SPEAKER_11]: jamaican uh jamaican yarders has cvd in it
um uh I know uh DJ short was pretty
[SPEAKER_11]: convinced part of what he was looking for
uh in cannabis was to replicate some
[SPEAKER_11]: mexican cannabis that he had had back in
the 60s down in uh when he was at the uh
[SPEAKER_11]: university down there and uh he was pretty
convinced that yeah it was like equal
[SPEAKER_11]: amount cvd and thc and so uh I don't know
that it's an essential part of what
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis can do for humans but I think
it's an important part uh and I what I
[SPEAKER_11]: what I think is coming uh because of
comments like what you just made is that
[SPEAKER_11]: uh increasingly people will start
recognizing cannabis not just for its
[SPEAKER_11]: inspirational or recreational or even
medicinal but just for the the sense of
[SPEAKER_11]: well-being that can come from it what you
were saying earlier Marcus about uh uh it
[SPEAKER_11]: feel when you feel good it's hard it's
hard to feel bad when you feel good uh
[SPEAKER_11]: when when the pain stops you don't feel
like biting back at things that happen in
[SPEAKER_11]: your life uh pain especially chronic pain
that just goes on and on and on never
[SPEAKER_11]: stops it's hard you can't get away from it
uh so blessings thank you for the
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunity to rant cvd is definitely a
bus ticket away from pain there's no
[SPEAKER_09]: question about that and by the way Marcus
um we're taking it out this morning I
[SPEAKER_09]: recently because of viewers listening to
hash church they sent me a giant box of
[SPEAKER_09]: roots and we took all those roots ground
them up and we put them in the chamber and
[SPEAKER_09]: extracted them so we're going to have the
very first marijuana root oil and I want
[SPEAKER_09]: to make sure that doctor Natasha gets a uh
a bit of it to examine and or look at and
[SPEAKER_09]: uh if anybody wants to do any research
with it I want to make all amounts of it
[SPEAKER_09]: available to people because I don't think
there's been anybody that's done a full-on
[SPEAKER_09]: root extract and to make sure that we got
it we left it uh in the chamber like 24
[SPEAKER_09]: hours to make sure we got every single
possible uh volatile out of the roots and
[SPEAKER_09]: it was quite a bundle of roots let me tell
you you know it came in a two two and a
[SPEAKER_09]: half foot square box and uh I think well
Natasha was talking about how in all the
[SPEAKER_09]: old books it talks about the many uses for
marijuana roots all the different kinds of
[SPEAKER_09]: medicines and poultices and whatever that
they made with it back when before people
[SPEAKER_09]: had an opinion about the phd part of it so
I was talking about that a few times and
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody contacted me and asked me if I
wanted some I said yes so here they are
[SPEAKER_09]: and now I'm I suspect it'll be high in
triterpenoids we'll see I want to hey Sam
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know I don't think I can send it
to you but I'd send you some maybe if
[SPEAKER_09]: there's no phd in it if you were even
interested anyway D-Wiz last show I guess
[SPEAKER_09]: or sort of the last show funny place to
come up with brand new information but you
[SPEAKER_09]: never know you never know could be it'll
be interesting seeing what's in it there's
[SPEAKER_09]: been a lot of speculation about it so I
did it so now we'll find out I remember
[SPEAKER_06]: years ago probably as early as like 99
2000 I made a bubble hash from stems just
[SPEAKER_06]: all the stems not stems cut from buds
either but like whole plant stems like
[SPEAKER_06]: long branches I just cut them all up into
little quarter inch sections and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: ran the whole batch and I got this like
white bubble it was the lightest fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: color bubble ever that came off the stems
and it was pretty good it was melty it was
[SPEAKER_06]: powerful it had taste it was it was it was
hard to wrap my head around that there was
[SPEAKER_06]: a resin on stocks that could be that's
when I actually not too long after
[SPEAKER_06]: probably within five years or so I started
trying to photograph stems and get closer
[SPEAKER_06]: to see what kind of trichome content they
had on there and I've seen them covered
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've seen them sparse both both ways
dude when you showed me the picture of
[SPEAKER_17]: when the seed went when we said that when
the leaf just came out of the seed and had
[SPEAKER_17]: a tripod I was just amazed that was one of
those pictures that you showed me I was
[SPEAKER_17]: right there you took that picture that was
it's definitely one most people did not
[SPEAKER_06]: know that the glands are on the plants
from the beginning because they're all
[SPEAKER_06]: like oh I just I only spray and veg and
