[SPEAKER_06]: Hey good morning everyone, Bubble Man
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about six in the morning right now
and I'm heading over to Remos to do some
[SPEAKER_06]: filming and some puffing today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just got the mothership here filled
up with the grunge off and we're just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to do a quick pouring it back into
its own bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this product, wake up in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can wake up in the morning and simply,
let's see, I don't want to make a big mess
[SPEAKER_05]: here but I want to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just pour that basically right back
into its bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try not to lose all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of this spillage.
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff is basically like a natural
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just basically do a quick rinse
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be extremely soapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grunge off is a soapy substance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's using, I think it uses an
enzyme from a soybean egg but basically
[SPEAKER_06]: what it does is it strips the resin off of
the inside of the pipe and it makes for
[SPEAKER_06]: very easy cleaning.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm doing here is rinsing it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see you get a very, very nice clean
piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I do every morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how I keep my whips, my daily
drivers I should say.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how I keep my daily drivers clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a nice quick rinse with hot water and
you've got yourself a beautiful clean
[SPEAKER_06]: bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Remos has no shortage of nice glass
over this place but we figured we might as
[SPEAKER_03]: well show up with a nice piece when we
show up, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Clean glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take this piece over to Remos and
see what he's saying this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got that mothership clean as a
whistle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to put her away in her case
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to keep everything nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my controller.
[SPEAKER_05]: My D-nails in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The quartz whip, quartz bowl, and my
remote control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, my glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that right there is pretty much all you
need for D-nailing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have my license in there just in
case I'm pulled over at any point in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to have the federal exemption to
show the RCMP that hey, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm allowed to have these pounds of hatch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get on the road and head
over to Remos, shall we?
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, another 6AM-er for the bubble
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just packed up my goods here in the truck.
And I'm going to head down to check out
Remos.
Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what he's up to.
Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Remos!
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going, buddy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, stoked to be back, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't kill us, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here at Remos, the urban growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just in the house grabbing some
things, but we're about to have a little
[SPEAKER_06]: session here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the D-nail getting ready to fire
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of different dry sifts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remos got his bags of wonderful kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stinks right through the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quads right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what I hope the MMPR growers can
produce, but that I am slightly doubtful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get this session happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Bumman's World.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hanging out with Remos today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super stoked to be here, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me on your show,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you had me online last time I was
here and that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to make that bubble with those,
I guess we were using fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was what?
[SPEAKER_06]: The UBC chemo kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a killer deal with that,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I was kind of surprised how much
we got.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it's interesting because I
was talking with Matt from the Great
[SPEAKER_06]: Gardener recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about the difference
between the oil yields and the bubble
[SPEAKER_06]: yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are almost like, why does the
oil pull out so much more yield?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he actually ran fan leaf through
his bubble bags and he got all this hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're like, um, um, sessile
heads that don't have capricate stocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just grow on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stock trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stock trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically real, real small little
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, he produced a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the strangest stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely not like, you know,
the real good stuff in the 90 and 73 bag,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, uh, it definitely had medicinals
there 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, and if you were to make oil out of
it, i.e.
[SPEAKER_06]: remove the oils that are in those little
wax membranes, you know, rather than the
[SPEAKER_06]: way with the hash, you're smoking the
whole wax membrane.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like a lower grade to a hash guy
with the oil that will just get all of
[SPEAKER_06]: that resin out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, not only the regular heads,
but in these smaller ones as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a side note for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, remember Jeff Tech?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, uh, took a bunch of stocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had to look over stocks and he said,
what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Firmly tumbler?
[SPEAKER_04]: He tumbled it and he got hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, I was telling these guys to do the
same thing with, with water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they did the family batch and I
said, try a stock batch.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only time I ever did it, it was the
whitest hash I ever made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was bizarre.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it had like no chlorophyll in it
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just this white.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here, I want you to push the top button
on this little remote control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the top button.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that's going to do is that's
going to turn on our D-nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Click.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just lit up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll go off for one second and then it'll
hit the temperature and then it'll climb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it set to about 750 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah, just stoked to have an
electric nail session with, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: with Remo.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing looks pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing is really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys have done a great job.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it's simply put, it's an element.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the box runs the temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, they've got all these wonderful
components.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not using the Chinese components
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got another British component for
the front piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to heat up to 700 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 750 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have a quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit dirty right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually keep it a little cleaner,
but it's machined to fit that pretty much
[SPEAKER_06]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That heats up the quartz to the right
temperature of 750 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: 800, 900, 600.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on sort of your palette and
your, your flavor, but it's basically a
[SPEAKER_06]: nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's ready to go one after another.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ready to go all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of an idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a little bit of water,
actually quite a bit of water,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mothership is kind of a neat piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes I'll put a third of
the water, a half of the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we got a lot in, so that's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed there's really good diffusion.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get lots of bubbles with this product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a sort of Swiss per capita,
which they call the fab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually they blow it out into an egg.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's this little guy right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little puck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can kind of see on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's holes in it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's etched.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a flower of life's laser etched
symbol.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where the bubbles come out of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right out of the top of that little puck.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's way for thin, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mothership.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys are definitely ahead of the
game right now with sort of the glass that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're, that they're producing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely a ton of talent coming out of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of the mothership crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess somewhat local, too, because
you're just over the border.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just right over the border in Bellingham,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're going to start it off
with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some Sweet Skunk Dry Hatch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy smokes, that smells like sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's 99% gland heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: No waters touch this hatch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's completely dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, the purity is still like what we
like with bubble magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Steve Covey, he gave me a cut
into this on the way back when he was in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the only sativa that I really loved
growing consistently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember just lighting it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people would come, you know,
even if it was a smoker, they'd come from
[SPEAKER_04]: across the room and come up to me and go,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any smoke, any smell, it's got such a
distinct sweet smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that came about, I remember,
about like just a shorter flowering sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: that still has that hazy, fluffy look,
but yet with this sweet, I just never
[SPEAKER_06]: really tasted a sweet haze before.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, hazes are usually just pissy and
almost sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, let's load you up with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from The Great Gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'm going to grab the one more
thing that I sort of forgot over here,
[SPEAKER_06]: which will come in handy for this,
which is a quartz carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when I put the bowl on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see that it's a little bit,
there's a lot of air coming through and
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just carve it up like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to use your finger to
control how much, how much you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to carve it,
just a little bit of reduction that the
[SPEAKER_06]: cap itself gives is perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flavor City.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to be doing sativa bowls with
Ramo at, what is it, 730 in the morning,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's early.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been up for a couple hours already
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you got that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had to get up pretty early.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I wasn't working in the garden
like you probably were, but pretty nice,
[SPEAKER_06]: eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little quick rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flavor City.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just went and saw these guys last
week over on the island.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a nice little facility going on
there, doing good things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a few years ago, they won a
cannabis cup in Amsterdam for ash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which hash was that that they won with,
I wonder?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like AOMA or Afghani?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was stoked at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went out for the victory dinner though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took place called Nomads.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had vegetarian food and regular food,
but it was all Middle Eastern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you guys were missed this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was weird how many people came up to my
booth and were like, is Remo here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Remo?
[SPEAKER_06]: I had quite a few people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had important work to do here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to take care of the coalition and
make sure we're going to get this
[SPEAKER_04]: injunction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been a lot of work myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I give you props.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's definitely only been a small key
group of players that have really been
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing this injunction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Remo is definitely high up on the
list along with Jason Wilcox and John
[SPEAKER_06]: Berthello and a whole list of other
wonderful people that are really putting
[SPEAKER_06]: their energies into not just being worried
about their own license, but actually
[SPEAKER_06]: being worried about everyone's license.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, even as it gets closer,
there's a lot of people that are just
[SPEAKER_06]: freaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hard thing to even discuss when you
consider how much energy people have put
[SPEAKER_06]: into building themselves a proper
facility, making it safe, doing all the
[SPEAKER_06]: cameras and all the security that Health
Canada requested, giving our addresses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We drunk through all the hoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We drunk through all the hoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did everything that we were needed to
do.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I still have faith because it
hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty ... I think we'll get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think whether we get it or not,
I think we won't stop growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're all going to be going
to jail either.
[SPEAKER_06]: That injunction is what I've got my money
on for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to give them the website
actually where they can go check that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mmarcoalitionagainstpropeel.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a Canadian citizen or even an
American or someone else from around the
[SPEAKER_06]: world that wants to learn what's going on
with us, then you can check out that
[SPEAKER_06]: website and there's a bunch of different
discussions and information that can give
[SPEAKER_06]: you the updates on what we're going
through here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't lose this battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's even more ridiculous is
that the feds expect us the night before
[SPEAKER_04]: to take all our weed that we have
accumulated and sitting around,
[SPEAKER_04]: destroy it all and start purchasing the
weed the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine any patient, because a lot
of them are on fixed incomes, taking
[SPEAKER_04]: perfectly good cannabis and destroying it
or flushing it down the toilet just to
[SPEAKER_04]: spend their money at $10 or $14 a gram the
very next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's throwing money down the drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: To do the math real quick of what Remo
just said, let's go to a lower number than
[SPEAKER_06]: $12 to $15 a gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say $10 because it's easy for the
math.
[SPEAKER_06]: That puts us about $4,480 bucks,
$448 grams per pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at about $4,500 for a pound and now
both Remo and I know how much resin is
[SPEAKER_06]: actually on that pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking at between $20 and $30.
[SPEAKER_06]: $30 grams for $5,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's over $100 a gram for resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's diluted on plant matter and hasn't
even been worked off the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to buy whole plant medicine from
these people.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't even sell extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be this ground, irradiated
crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like buying a bunch of shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm praying that it's just all a nightmare
and they just want these MMPR licenses in
[SPEAKER_06]: so bad that they've made these ridiculous
assumptions as to how reality can exist
[SPEAKER_06]: for us, which we don't fit into this
reality that they're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see any reason for there to be us
existing producing our own cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: having these commercial producers as well
because not everybody can grow their
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 100% and I get a lot of flack for this
because I post the links, I'm 100% for
[SPEAKER_06]: licensed production facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just 100% against exclusive licensed
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have the ability to do so,
do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of this grandfathering in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone has the right to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can brew your own beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make your own wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure you could probably grow
your own tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just don't bother because the
products that they have available to them
[SPEAKER_06]: are good enough for those people.
[SPEAKER_06]: The small percentage of people that those
products aren't good enough for,
[SPEAKER_06]: they brew and make their own wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't we do the same thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us grow our own medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one more side note.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've got to get real with the
pricing because if they don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's going to happen is most of these
patients aren't going to be able to forage
[SPEAKER_04]: your $10 a gram of stuff and they're just
going to go right back to the street,
[SPEAKER_04]: right back to Black Market to buy their
cannabis because it'll be cheaper for
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be able to have a better quality
of life because they have money left over.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't blow all their money on taxes
and high price weed and get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: schwag.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll go to the street and buy it at
$20.80 for some killer weed because I know
[SPEAKER_04]: it's out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it is out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be interesting to see where it goes
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full melt dry set.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just did that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never smoked cigarettes before,
did you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Never in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't smoke cigarettes because you'll do
bigger hoots just like bubble man right
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing is for sure that joints are not
going to affect that and I'll bring this
[SPEAKER_06]: back to once again Steve Covey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now before I met you, Steve Covey,
you remember how much that guy used to
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: He smoked like a pound every week or two
or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just insane how much weed he was
smoking and I kind of was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: dude, it can't be good for your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I smoked more though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went down and did this big test on his
lungs where they blow into the machine and
[SPEAKER_06]: it was at some heavy beauty clinic down in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well the guy's lungs tested like that of
I'm certain it was like a late 20s healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what that is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Covey was in his late 40s or something at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same as smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tobacco, what it does when you smoke it,
you have silicate hairs that help clean
[SPEAKER_04]: out your lungs and those hairs get
paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you smoke cannabis, those hairs
are still very much active.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you cough, it's actually a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's forcing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an expectorant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the real bottom line is that they
spray tobacco with radium 226 which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: radioactive nucleotide and we don't put
that on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tobacco wouldn't be that bad if they just
didn't spray that chemical on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have friends in Jamaica that
smoke like the natural stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't give me a headache.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I smell Indian spirit or whatever,
those give me a headache.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're with cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a filter and it's not real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well they got other cams in there to
actually make it slow burning.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And make it go out and all that stuff
that's not allowed to burn for a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends harvest their tobacco right out
of the jungle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 100% the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from a good friend,
D420K.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's up in Prince George.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's been mastering the art of dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean he's got it down pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll give you a little rip here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bombs away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to Hoochie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel that reduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes the hit, in my opinion,
easier to take.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a nice rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll clear it out for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some leftovers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we're hoping to show you a little
bit about what Remo's got going on today
[SPEAKER_06]: and obviously he's always got some fun
things to show us so we'll probably just
[SPEAKER_06]: continue to smoke a few more bowls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you my turpinator experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I want to hear about the
turpinator experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, turpinator is a new product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Green Planet is distributing up
here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's supposed to increase not
only turpene production but trichome and
[SPEAKER_06]: resin production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure how but if it can,
that is an unbelievable statement to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're putting it to the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great thing to put to the test too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this works, this is a revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially for hash makers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without growing any more Canada,
you're going to get 20% more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And more so than that, even for me,
it's like to increase turpene content or
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to have any idea how to
manipulate such a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turpenes are the modulators of
cannabinoids and THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: They offer and create different
perspectives depending on their ratios and
[SPEAKER_06]: where they are in their life.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why cannabis can change so much
when you cure it over a long period of
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, get that creeper sort of weed
thing coming on if you've ever cured.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some ancient hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 13 or 14 years and it was dry
sifted from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was the smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the smoke was absolutely... I
mean, just to be able to smoke anything
[SPEAKER_06]: that old was special.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was red powder dust so it looked like
nothing I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, taste-wise, it was very
stale.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very stale taste-wise, but I will
say that it was the first time since
[SPEAKER_06]: probably I was in high school that I
experienced that creeper effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't experienced the creeper effect
and I really started putting it together
[SPEAKER_06]: with the way the turpenes... When you get
a real good hit and it grabs you in the
[SPEAKER_06]: throat, those are turpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are those volatile oils just
grabbing you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can bring cannabinoids into your
bloodstream right through the back of your
[SPEAKER_06]: throat just from taking one good rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously they get into your lungs
and it goes even quicker into your
[SPEAKER_06]: bloodstream and whatnot, but the fact that
they weren't present, they were almost
[SPEAKER_06]: gone, you take a hit of this hash and it
would be literally three, four,
[SPEAKER_06]: five minutes before you felt the effects
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that turpenes modulate the
effects of cannabinoids and THC,
[SPEAKER_06]: so being able to increase or even
manipulate the ratios of turpenes in any
[SPEAKER_06]: strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I had to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do they store that hash that you spoke
that was 13 years old?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it vacuum sealed?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, I think for quite a while,
and I'd have to confirm because I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to be disinforming people,
that it was in a nitrogen-rich
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: That the oxygen was removed and it was
replaced with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will preserve for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I think that was around maybe 10
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when I saw it, it was 12 or 13
years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at two years, I'd say just inside a
small little glass case, probably in a
[SPEAKER_06]: cool, dark place, but nothing like a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's still around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think now today, it was made in 1991.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there might be a half a gram or a gram
of it, but yeah, my good buddy,
[SPEAKER_06]: he used to just give me the tiniest little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each year that I go to Amsterdam from like
around 11 or 12 to 16 or 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pretty neat experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, maybe we will get our
licenses preserved and we won't have to
[SPEAKER_06]: worry about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can start doing things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, think positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they liked us straight up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And exposed us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if you guys know this,
but they sent out letters to all 30,000
[SPEAKER_06]: exemptees or people that hold federal
licenses, whether you're a designated
[SPEAKER_06]: grower or a person that's possessing it
and growing it yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent us all letters in big white
envelopes with clear plastic windows,
[SPEAKER_06]: huge clear plastic windows that instead of
just showing, you know, our address in the
[SPEAKER_06]: corner, it showed their full name,
which is basically like the medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Access program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically what they did is they told
anyone that could like every mailman,
[SPEAKER_06]: every person in the mail industry that
touched or had seen those envelopes,
[SPEAKER_06]: they knew that every one of those
addresses either had cannabis stored there
[SPEAKER_06]: or corresponded with a grow up even
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Corresponded with a grow up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it was, it took me a few days to
actually realize that that happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in disbelief.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just out everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a big screw up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke it up man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one was the Shishkeberry crossed with
the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: He calls it the bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does it have that Shishkeberry smell
of old though?
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember this Shishkeberry?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from cash crop candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think this originally, well,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to ask again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Originally Shishkeberry was from Breeder
Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cash crop candy did use a lot of the
genetics that Steve used.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're loose.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're loose.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back again.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've just been hitting this nonstop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you should be rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give you a little hit of bar
up too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like catnip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But none for Kitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitty gets none.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitty gets none.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell us Remo, why the beard?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the beard?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I noticed you got a beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people get playoff beards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is my beard for the injunction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not shaving until we get the
injunction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I don't end up looking like a ZZ
Top here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're going to get the injunction.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't get the injunction,
we're going to get something like it that
[SPEAKER_04]: appeals to us all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you don't get the injunction,
I'll have a great place to stash duties
[SPEAKER_04]: under here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another hit of the barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barb's away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sideshow barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to roll it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you supercharge it?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is unleaded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unleaded.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's early.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to maintain smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want joint rolling to be a lost
art for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you will hold it together.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because none of the kids know how to roll
joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they have bongs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you roll a couple joints a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying don't dab or don't smoke
your barb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to do both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll a couple joints a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't rolled a joint in a long time,
but maybe I'll roll one today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got lots of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can select any cannabis you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got like a half a dozen different
kinds of rolling papers to select from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure you roll the nicest joint
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bubble Man joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch for that video coming soon to
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked to get into the garden and
check out what we have flowering in there
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we've got a few different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the UBC chemo Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got White OG from Karma Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have some Kosher Kush from DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else have I got in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a nice selection so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Cheese, which I'm about to smoke
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one had the real sort of ranky,
danky smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it grows giant buds, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very surprised at how dense it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, some of the biggest buds in my
garden are going to be the Blue Cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your buds generally are always pretty
dense, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the different strains you show me have
that one sort of thing in common that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're definitely... Yeah, I find that
Kush doesn't really grow giant buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really good quality and lots of
resin, lots of crystals, or trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystals, trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Call them what you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, Jodie called them something
cool the other day that I'd never heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: She called them cannabis heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, when you're isolating those
cannabis heads... Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a cannabis head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I might be one as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's to cannabis heads everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will smoke this joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to have a couple more rips
with Ramo, and then we're going to head
[SPEAKER_06]: into the garden and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're ready to go back in or what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put sunglasses on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stunning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, week six of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just starting to leach.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be some yellow here and
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The purple is just starting to set in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just lower the temperature of the air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a crazy test.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're testing the turpinator product out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposed to increase your flaminolase,
turpinolase, and resin content,
[SPEAKER_04]: give you more trichomes up to 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try anything that'll do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this half of the room, we tried
turpinator on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this half, no turpinator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be able to compare the two plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get bubble man to take some
close-up photos so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because apparently there's a physical
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually physically see more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Considerable amount more.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to test it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm definitely stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that can make a claim like that,
you got to at least give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm giving it a fair try for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This already has a lot of trichomes on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very resinous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some great purple color
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be coming in here in a little bit
with the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any resin, any plant you talk about,
I'll show a nice macro photo.
[SPEAKER_06]: A nice photograph of the plant you're
pointing to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got five different types to show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five different kinds today, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these ones here, the UBC chemos.
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole row is UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half this row is UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the fuzz on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is a nice looking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the smell is kind of out of this
room for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give that a little sniff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, is that sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Towards the end, it starts to go purple as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find the cushions seem purple first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a nice cushion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the turpinator is working.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's rolled in sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice resin production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a cush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, this is a perfect sample two
plants because they're roughly the same
[SPEAKER_04]: size.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the same strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the center of the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll get you to do the macro
shots of these two to compare the two to
[SPEAKER_04]: see if we can visibly see more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this one is non-turpinator and
this is the turpinator right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does look kind of a little more
crystalline.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a little early.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a lot of the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to get the maximum strength,
which is 30 mils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Rockstar right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Rockstar?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just back at that half the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a couple extra weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything up front here is a little more
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is white OG from Carbondale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're all beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really getting affected by the cold
air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the kosher.
[SPEAKER_04]: The DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the CO2 at down to 464,
it looks like I've got to swap that CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: tank out today.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get a new CO2 tank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess you can get your lens on and
take some macro photos.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to slap the macro lens on this
camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to start looking at some
of these resin glands up close.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy is a kill two birds with one
stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remo sweeping his room with CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some high discharge right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Moses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I find is that all the
little stems, after you pick these,
[SPEAKER_03]: these things just drop and fall off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what goes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to give it another shot or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to photography.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am now on the blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, bubble man here just doing a
little photography, macro photography here
[SPEAKER_06]: in Remo's room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful UBC chemo Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll be sharing these photos in the
near near future.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is absolutely covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a whole row of them here
behind me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to shoot that and then we're
going to head on over and we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: shoot the blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the blue cheese here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Covered in resin completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about the rock star.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to photograph the rock star.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another real beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, last but certainly not
least, we're going to talk about the
[SPEAKER_06]: kosher Kush from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing looks like Girl Scout cookies,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and I better not forget Karma
Genetics, the beast back here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe this is the white OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing is pretty ridiculous as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have fun nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a room full of monsters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where I'm the happiest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get back to macro shooting so
I can share the pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you soon on Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, welcome back guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try this new pulse rating
it's got yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're going to be hitting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got this awesome dabber right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like the dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, let me press up some of this dry set
so we can actually use the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now I've got to borosilicate
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to use a Fumo pipe on there,
but we want to try dabbing a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got this ledger reader.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually put concentrates or dabs
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got the dome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there that we're going to put on
last, but not least.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last but not least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so let's get some dabble-able
product here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the guest, so I'm going to heat it
up and let you go for it, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to get the quartz now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does hold the heat a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what... This isn't hot now,
is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, your quartz bowl might fit on
this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if it would.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just check it out real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, usually I can do it if I... I
usually like to take... Well, I can do
[SPEAKER_06]: this little trick where you get to holding
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quartz is an unbelievable product.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little bit hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is wicked hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't really meant to fit in there,
but nah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had a piece, we would have been able
to do it, but that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quartz.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's just a... Or it's a little
glass bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's borosilicate now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll hit the borosilicate now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't hold the heat quite the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's equally as clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what it's all about,
having a clean bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, I just wanted to hit the pipe
and feel the filtration of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing's a Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really... This is my new favorite pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got tons of... Dozens of pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got dozens of bonds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nice looking piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get the torch and a little dab
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you take it for a test drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take Reno's new pipe for a
test drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: False glass, folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we got a little dab of the
barb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Borosilicate rips.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the different ways to inhale the plant
you love.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is kind of an all-around
guy, Remo, when you think about it,
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's smoking joints one minute and
the next minute he's doing pretty much the
[SPEAKER_06]: most up-to-date thing that the young
people are doing these days, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: taking dabs, torching nails, electric
nails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to diversify.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would like to stay current.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the glass, as you know, cools rather
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to take the torch off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's go time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll just put this right over it
right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's go time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go, bubble man, go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he puts the reducer on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was real nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really a nice clean looking piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the chandelier diffuser.
[SPEAKER_06]: From our family to yours, enjoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like the double shower head.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a real nice piece and the taste was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_06]: This time with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inhaling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will inhale, unlike some presidents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlike some presidents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't inhale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, everyone fell for that one tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of helps to show you that those
guys can pretty much say anything and
[SPEAKER_06]: people will just swallow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was president, I wouldn't inhale
frequently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be a buzzkill about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems as though it's coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the one saving grace in our
injunction and in our change in licensing
[SPEAKER_06]: is that look at how it's changing
everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legalized in, not legalized, but
definitely statewide allowed in Washington
[SPEAKER_06]: and in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: California has never been too far behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: More and more states putting the
initiatives on their ballots to get for,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard Florida, I've heard Michigan,
I've heard Boston, I've heard New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: The look nights are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Professional with his own pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's so smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I felt like the filtration was
so much less than I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mothership has much more water in it
right now and more of a chug, but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: still filtered beautifully.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else can we smoke in this thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we could smoke some really nice
powdered dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that's something from our
friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think to a degree, it won't probably
bubble and melt the way we want it to.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the ideal situation to get
something that's like extremely clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like these two are 99% just glad heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll beat it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're going to need that dome on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to become, it's going to
be a little bit tricky here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the dome?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn this into a whole experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: That last smoke had so much flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that bar of the shish kemari
across with that candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing like smoking out of a
clean rig off glasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready to rock?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm kind of ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are always asking, can you dab
bubble or can you dab dry sift?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting bone dry powder.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not leaving much residual on the nail
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
We'll give him a shout out.
He's just started his YouTube channel over
at D420k.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's making killer hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be up here in the next
month or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks pretty orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it does too.
Oh, that's a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too unfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two and a half feet or maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sure a nice little piece.
It reminds me of the Toro.
Nice big base on that thing.
Yeah, I love that.
It'll never tip over.
Actually, you might want to get that
people's close up.
Oh, yeah, no, not at all.
Let's say about three, four feet.
It's about as close as you'll be able to
get.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take some photos as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really nice piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulse glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bit dabberish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a light saber.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Pulse Glass for the awesome rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks Pulse Glass for the awesome
rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Mothership for this awesome rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks D-Nail for the electronic nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's endless thanks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to take time to give thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing they teach you in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're constantly saying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're constantly doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Urban Grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.
Bye.
