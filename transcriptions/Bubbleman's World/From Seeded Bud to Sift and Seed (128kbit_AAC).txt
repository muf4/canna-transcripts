[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, check out the Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screens are out, more importantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start it with the house of the great
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to walk through?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of temperature and humidity are
you looking for in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's open on either end,
it's tough to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't feel muggy in here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, if it gets too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more concerned with the air blowing
down and just keeping a constant airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still takes seven to ten days for them
to dry here and then they'll go into bins
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from there we'll treat them,
flip them, get the moisture out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: from them de-stock them and then back into
bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the shake is put on screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's what I'm talking about right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want people to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you do it, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go and buy expensive
racks from restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can build your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got them dated and named.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just so much resin lost when not
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been sitting on here since
December 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have catch trays on the bottoms
or on the very bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have little trays that clip onto here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it clips onto here and then you pull it
out and then you flip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you move it down and then you
pull the next one out, flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only ever it gets flipped once and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then from there it's scooped up
and... Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either put through the tumblers,
through the tumblers to the, and then to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash, then to the bakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tumblers, bags and bakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it still has, you can see it's
sort of dry to the touch, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze it in the middle, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a couple more days to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a barber bud seed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little frosty that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these have been... That's very
frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fan leaves removed, but it's, you know,
a lot of the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or crystal-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why you do this over screens,
cause he just literally knocked off
[SPEAKER_01]: 853,000 land heads when he did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and we're catching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're catching them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they wouldn't be caught without those
screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, if I just bang these a
little bit, you can see the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a seed separator that you guys
use, or just do it all over?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple, sort of, again, homemade
machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just run them through holes?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not even.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use more sort of gravity and airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen those laser-perforated hole
sheets though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a little vibrator?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the one with the, blows the air
up and blows the shaft up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the tube or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pretty impressive too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing beats these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love eating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the work here is to deseed
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: De-stock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's seed, you don't really
have to do this stage, but because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that we want to capture the
trichomes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They always want to keep the surface in
front of you clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you cut it off and it hits
the screen, thousands of trichomes have
[SPEAKER_00]: just fallen off that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's, you know what's dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I could sit here and use my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need the Fiskars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need these scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can operate this whole thing with just
using my scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this bud itself is still, if you
squeezed it, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll sit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a little de-budding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little de-budding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a few macro shots of
that resin to show people the quality that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you have a little pile in
front of you, just slightly push it
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to make sure that the bud
falls directly on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of do a one far shot and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess I could have helped you there.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one was definitely well worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice pile of sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will you keep these four separate or
just mix them all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost have to put my shades on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't you glad you did that work on
screens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeeze it for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromatic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick!
Quick!
[SPEAKER_00]: Aromic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So time to make some dry sift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, so now we.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that shish kebari smell is unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stopped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflected the keef that fell off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice knock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, because it's a seed crop,
why don't you fold it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't dump it too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't dump it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just fold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll throw the whole batch in the
tumbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna do it for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do a one hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: At which point, we'll take it and then go
get the seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after we got the seed out of it,
we'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll bring it back for a 24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll put it in for a 24 to 48
hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put it in for like two days.
48 to 72 hours of run.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure you get it all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did we just dump in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 pounds of herb?
10 pounds of herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 pounds of herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well within my storage limits of my MMAR
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mine too.
So we'll put it in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much on the outside, but after the
24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw that one that was bud when we
put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have broken it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work for you,
especially with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry Kirk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pile got so deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the screen was hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like some hundreds of grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good amount of weight right there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is dense, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks denser than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it is denser than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's denser than it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gotten to the point where
Barbara's been well sifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sifted it for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those big fluffy buds we had are now
just sorta like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you gotta get the seed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is put it onto this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the seed and everything that will
already fall through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this small grinding
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks up all the bud and in particular
gets out all the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do this with gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that loose stuff, all the seed that's
already harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the loose stuff, let it fall through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you do it all, you end up
sorta with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the seed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You separate those further using screen
separators or pull them out by hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple other wind machines that
will blow the chaff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one more after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more system after that that uses the
angles and lets the seeds roll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put a fan on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows off the chaff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good amount of sift came off of that
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after we get the seed out,
we'll actually put this back in the sifter
[SPEAKER_00]: and do a 24 hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, get the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a 24 hour to 48 hour run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff will go to edibles,
tinctures and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
