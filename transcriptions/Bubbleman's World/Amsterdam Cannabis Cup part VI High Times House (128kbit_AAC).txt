[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we are here at the High Times
Cannabis Cup entry house.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we're to give our entries.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Familiar faces?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug from THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try my dry sift yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I should give you a hit of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like a little?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but just a little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give people... Yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's gonna do up a hit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just a pure little one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we forget that there's ladies
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Soma's in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boot is in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Turpin is in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Turpin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing turp hits now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we giving him a dry sift turp hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure turp dropped on top of pure dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell it now, right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you smell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the haze though you gave him?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not jelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's haze, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right... It's kind of like when you
do... Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A potentiator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it a chaser, like it is a
modulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And exactly what harmaline and harmane do
to ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_01]: They potentiate the molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what are you going after here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez, we've been trying to get over to
Dave's house for like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, maybe we'll end up coming
over by your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, give me a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Marion, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's get you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we got you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that's not one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go, now I got you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, big Buddha.
[SPEAKER_01]: We going to the chaser too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, lift your hand up for one sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really grabs you by the nuts,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a bubblegum hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, he's just hitting it back with an
awesome... That's beautiful, that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a freshie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we got one for true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright,

[SPEAKER_02]: Tony?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a Terp chaser right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop it off the entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Cup 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good peeps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so here we are at Soma's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite places to visit when
I'm in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma's got the most incredible place.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got just the way it's set up with the
beds and the hammocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got unbelievable quality of crystals
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this Ling Nam rock, this chunk of
tourmaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all... It's just the biggest and
most ridiculous pieces you've ever seen in
[SPEAKER_01]: your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the coolest cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the coolest cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you space out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, the cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cats do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's a good voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony, penthouse upstairs, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: View outside of the whole city.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like this action?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cats?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this cat, Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at the rooftop terrace of Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overlooking the city on the Faisalstraat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes into Dam Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty much see the whole city
above this little rooftop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony loading up some hits of some turp
melt for Buddha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this Soma, dad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me smell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma, this one's for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's for you because you made such a
big trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's a... That's what I was
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a... We'll make another one for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hash cannoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash cannoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has pure terpenes added to the
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has 99% dry sift in the center with
one drop of terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the sift is dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jarella.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jarella base melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jarella.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was no joke right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took a knee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took two knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two knees for the Jarella and the
sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that the sweet Jarella skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet Jarella skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Felt it in my nose still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll take one of those too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a serious one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is the piece?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have other ones that are better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are actually quite a bit better than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you think that's worth,
Soma?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Peters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Peters and Banjo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banjo did the Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Bob Snodgrass?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know him personally, but I
definitely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a good buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know him personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering that actually,
because when you said you were living in
[SPEAKER_03]: Eugene, there's only so many fucking heads
living in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives like two blocks away from me and
he would always buy his weed from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about... What's his name there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Soos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the parrots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening with that guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember he was...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if he's still alive even.
[SPEAKER_01]: He must be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philip Hoffman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him in like 96 or 97 when I was in
Vancouver and he was... I think he had
[SPEAKER_01]: also just gotten busted or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he had big time trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, he was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came up to Vancouver and was running
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met Soos in 1990.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met Soos at a rainbow gathering in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to be friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was an amazing carver, artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, look, I can carve you a piece
of pipestone into an amazing pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had this raw piece of pipestone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were at the rainbow gathering.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red pipestone?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started carving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started carving this pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was an eagle's claw holding the
ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another friend of mine who I just
got back in touch with, he beaded around
[SPEAKER_03]: the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice bead work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the choices bowls I ever
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Soos made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we became friends after he made
that pipe and I traded him for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we were in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was having all these problems with
cannabis busts, being an activist and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, look, want to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you just come out to Oregon
sometime?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come out to the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, I got a great place way up in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got diesel gas generators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I make my own electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a couple of really nice rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll share some genetics with you and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I fucking drove across the country
with my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went to his place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a camper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't need a place to stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just needed a place to park.
[SPEAKER_03]: He let me park on his land.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started helping him with a few crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I eventually got my own place in
Eugene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I moved away from his place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made my own grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started getting, he had some
really nice genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the big skunk Korean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I started breeding with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so after I moved away, I lived in
Eugene for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in those five years, most of the time,
I was friends with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after about four years,
he wigged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he made me like his enemy,
which I never was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that after he got busted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he got old?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was super talented.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was super cool with his birds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He fucking grew some great ass weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was also an egomaniac.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I met him, he had a picture book full
of those parrots and pictures of his
[SPEAKER_01]: property and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like all of that was
the past for him now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was kind of carrying it around in
this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how we met him,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barge became really good friends with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barge became really good friends with
Seuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: For quite a few years, they were very
close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seuss had some good talents, boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just a crazy guy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he loved to blame other people for
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been guilty of it myself on occasion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to see you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to make some candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have smoke out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come out and smoke out of it
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must be great at cleaning pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty good at cleaning them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: ISO, 99%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I use ISO, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what time are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have friends that are glass
blowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can kiln them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just burns away all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kiln it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not 99%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get 99% here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roar stuff works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's like hydrochloric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to come back tomorrow and
watch you make your candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the 20k piece leaning out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see him shake the Joe Peters out
the window?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something wrong with that Tony Terpene
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have to say about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had faith he wasn't going to drop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I knew he wasn't going to drop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little B-roll of my buddy's hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitting Earl right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the FTK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hitting the lowly straight fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll call you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slumming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slumming it with the bubble in the
straight fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you later, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
