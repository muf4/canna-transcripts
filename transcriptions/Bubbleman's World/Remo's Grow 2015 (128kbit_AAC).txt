[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
and welcome to an exciting day of Heading
[SPEAKER_01]: over to Remos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are in the truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're heading over to Remos We have an
absolutely breathtaking sunrise happening
[SPEAKER_01]: on the way over to his place here as I
head east on the Trans Canada heading over
[SPEAKER_01]: to Remos place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen Remos in a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been doing all sorts of amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's started himself a new company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has himself a new warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing all sorts of different foods
and rooting gels and basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's he's really taking himself
to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's no longer with advanced nutrients,
but he's sort of on his own and just
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting promoting the Remos Urban Grower
brand and it's always a pleasure to go see
[SPEAKER_01]: Remos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's got one of the nicest gardens
I've ever had the pleasure of visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you it'll be interesting to see
what happens in the future of Canada and
[SPEAKER_01]: the future of cannabis because you know
this guy Remos is going to have a position
[SPEAKER_01]: in it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we will see him soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright guys, I am here at Remos office
just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is usually where we're puffing bowls
and enjoying, you know, the resin that we
[SPEAKER_01]: love so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remos inside the room right now,
which is just through this door and
[SPEAKER_01]: another door and he is watering his
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We noticed his five ton air conditioner
had about 55 gallons of water saved up and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's basically when he realizes it's
time to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's in there watering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to go in with my macro lens and
get you guys those photos that you so
[SPEAKER_01]: crave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure to photograph at Remos
because the quality of the resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of the plants and the quality
of the grow is just so on point that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just it's comfortable for me to be in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Method 7's for the HPS glasses,
the new coupes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to close shut off all the fans so
the plants aren't moving and the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature remains quite cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never get too hot in Remos rooms nor do
his plants and he never seems to have any
[SPEAKER_01]: type of nutrient burn whatsoever so I
believe this is one of the first crops
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be photographing that was grown with
his new line of nutrients and I'll let him
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you about that a little bit after I
photograph the plants so why don't we go
[SPEAKER_01]: see what Remos up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a good idea to have a door between
the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get the white balance on point for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are nice and normal looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a hard working man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watering my plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in week 6 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just giving it some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just giving that plain condensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well everything looks absolutely
spectacular as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my own nutrients this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I was just saying that on the
other side of the door that this will be
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time I've actually photographed
using the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that have used your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole line, hey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm quite satisfied with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some tweaking on it and I think
we've got a product that the public will
[SPEAKER_02]: be totally happy with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm happy I know you're going to be
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I can say this much right off the bat
that it's definitely up to par with what I
[SPEAKER_01]: consider you to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just from opening the door these look
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero root newt burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the resin glistening from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like standard killer stuff for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I guess really the best,
you know better than any machine that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bio assay of Remo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually the first nutrients we have come
off our assembly line I want you to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take home and grow your plants with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh that'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd do a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd do a little Remo experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take these guys for a little
walk through your amazing garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them a little bit about what I'm
about to get the macro lens out and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess I'll start doing photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes you keep working buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to work.
Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big unit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always just the most ridiculous quality
when it comes to Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it might sound like I'm blowing
smoke up his ass but I'm telling you I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been in a lot of grow rooms and the amount
of work that goes into this one is very
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always good for fall colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I can always guarantee that
I'm going to get when I hit Remo's room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter the time of the year
because he controls most of the variables
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room from the temperatures to the
humidities to how often the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: watered to how wet they stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all ends up really showing in the end
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited to photograph these plants
because I've never photographed anything
[SPEAKER_01]: grown with Remo's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's not just anyone that can
just produce a nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'm sure a lot of people think it's
a very simple thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get your NPK but as I was talking to
Remo earlier there are a lot of variations
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a lot of different qualities
in the materials that you can use for
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and some companies will cut
corners while others will not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a pretty strong feeling that
Remo's nutrient company will be on the not
[SPEAKER_01]: cut corners list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that already down to the bottom of
the barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy smokes man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a 55 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show a few other strains here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some pushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually photographing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's over there right now by an absolute
monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this is a Sour G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's one of the fetos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of grows like an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's definitely like not the really
stretched out version that Kind Selections
[SPEAKER_01]: told me about because I also got one from
Kind Selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one Fino and he said it was very
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just standing next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put those method sevens on so I don't have
to squint so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have the natural method sevens
because I'm controlling my white balance
[SPEAKER_01]: right now with the camera so you're seeing
everything as under regular light.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, HPS lights are always going to
produce this very orange light so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to avoid that slap on some method
sevens and you will not have that worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take you over to see this Girl Scout
cookies because she is absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this thing is just fudged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fud, fud and more fud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a wall of fud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of ridiculous actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an unbelievable mass of fud on this
plant dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I can barely reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven and a half feet tall I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your roof?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is seven footer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd do some resin production too for such
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a wall of fud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable and then next door we have a
little chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sweet sweet
chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful fall colors on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you can always be most
impressed about is the tips of his leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see the yellow tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people will have burn like you
wouldn't believe but never seen it in
[SPEAKER_01]: Remos, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful resin content on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He definitely knows how to grow vegetative
weight but more importantly he knows how
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow trichomes as I am completely
surrounded by trichomes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright I can do this all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get taking pictures so you
guys can go a little bit closer and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: see what's going on on a macro level in
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ready now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you rooted and grounded?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooted and grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooted and grounded.
