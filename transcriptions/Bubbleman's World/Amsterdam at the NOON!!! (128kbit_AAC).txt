[SPEAKER_01]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here with Bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Giselle and Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Giddy's over there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the cannabis cup has not been
cancelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has been cancelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis cup exists in the hearts of
the people, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, Giddy knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see any one of us in the streets
here in Amsterdam, please come on over and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke a dab with us.
