[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is nice and early on a Wednesday
afternoon, and I'm actually heading over
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Sunshine Coast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't really see it over there,
but I assure you it is over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got to take a ferry to get over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna jump on that ferry in about 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only a few minutes from the ferry
terminal from my house, so nice and quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we're gonna be going and seeing
Stratosphere and Corey Cottenham Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two guys have been absolutely
killing it up on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only see them every once in a while,
but every time I do they have absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: impeccable glass that is, you know,
beyond inspirational.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I've heard that they've
been doing lately is they're producing
[SPEAKER_02]: moving pieces of glass, spinners and
whatnot, built into the pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we'll get to see some of that
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna spend a little bit of time
with them, have some breakfast,
[SPEAKER_02]: have a session, find out what they're up
to in the next couple of months here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully get to see them on the torch
a little bit for a little bit of glass
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that all works out,
and I'm gonna bring you guys with me the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna jump in this truck right
here and head over to the ferry now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you guys join me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we're heading down here
towards Horseshoe Bay, which is called the
[SPEAKER_02]: Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from Horseshoe Bay we're gonna head
over to the Sunshine Coast to the terminal
[SPEAKER_02]: called Langdale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure what my truck's beeping at there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cash
[SPEAKER_02]: or credit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we're heading down here to the
ferry so we can jump on that boat and head
[SPEAKER_02]: over to see Stratosphere and Corey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be a good little day over on the
Sunshine Coast but it's been a while since
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been over on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks pretty dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I better stay in lane 11,
the one she told me to stay in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I'm probably wondering what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, right behind the old Impala.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright guys, that much closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright guys, so I'm here at the line up
to the ferry, which isn't much of a line
[SPEAKER_02]: up at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about maybe 35 minutes to wait for
it to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's maybe 25 cars here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have once again, I have this bane of my
existence I have to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one of these converters,
a Terminator mobile power inverter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got this for my D-nail and I bought
this and of course the D-nail has too much
[SPEAKER_02]: power.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't heat up using this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's okay because I talked to the
guys at D-nail and they were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna send you a battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna figure out what battery works
best and we're gonna send you a battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sent me this battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually sent this battery locked
into a table that my friend has.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend who bought the table from
D-nail who didn't want to open the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: he got me this battery, the same battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell ya, it doesn't work with the
D-nail, which you guys have seen in my
[SPEAKER_02]: videos before and I keep forgetting the
unit that does work, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dabinator is a European model.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 220 volt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works on 110.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically works everywhere and on
everything, but I forgot it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: My D-nail's the smaller unit and it's more
travel friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really gotta start figuring this out
because I was gonna have a nice D-nail
[SPEAKER_02]: session with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got not a bad backup here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the Ceram pen, which is my little
pen that's got the ceramic internal pieces
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, we got that on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we gonna heat up?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are gonna heat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got heated up edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice sizzle on that pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got all sorts of nice rosin that I'm
bringing over to share with the boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some darker stuff here that I made
from some sweet pink Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sweet pink, got some other much
lighter stuff that I made from the Lindsay
[SPEAKER_02]: OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also Lindsay OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice color on this Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a beautiful color and really nice
stability too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can totally pick it up and play around
with it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we put a tiny little bit of
this Lindsay into,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh my God, it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I usually just turn the little
heater on a tiny little bit when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: putting rosin in and it just, it just
drops it off beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have a couple of little rips
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty excited to go see these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't spent a ton of time with either
of them, but I have known them for some
[SPEAKER_02]: time now between the two of them and
they're just extremely talented glass
[SPEAKER_02]: blowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that we have some glass blowers
of this sort of caliber that live right
[SPEAKER_02]: here in British Columbia, literally right
across the water from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to admit I am feeling pretty
spoiled today that I just get to wake up,
[SPEAKER_02]: drive the truck over to the Sunshine
Coast, over the ferries, maybe catch some
[SPEAKER_02]: dolphins and whales you never know off the
ferry and you know, go see a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: great guys, see what they're up to and
share it all with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope you guys are excited for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad little rip this Saram Pen gives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to admit it's got two heaters on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know how to spell it,
it's C-E-R-A-M-P-E-N, the Saram Pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got two ceramic heater coils on
the inside, two little loops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of them come with one,
this one comes with two and I have to say
[SPEAKER_02]: it really makes a notable difference on
how it vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess I'm gonna sit here and puff
more of this rosin and yeah, once we get
[SPEAKER_02]: onto the ferry, I'll give you guys a
little bit of ferry view, get out onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: top upper deck and maybe check out the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a pretty nice day out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly the temperature,
18 degrees or something, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: overcast, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the kind of weather that you see
the wildlife in the ocean, so I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: bummed out about it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you on that ferry real soon
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I'm back at the back of the
ferry, the classic place that you head to
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are quite a few different people on
the ferry today, so I'm being pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: chill, but yeah, this is what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a few rosin rips out of the Ceram
pen at the back of the ferry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look forward to landing though and
having a serious de-nail session.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys, so the ferry is almost
ready here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about to head out, pull up to the
Sunshine Coast, which is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got a little bit of a drive
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be driving up to a place
called Roberts Creek, which is about maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 20, 25 minutes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into the Sunshine Coast towards,
what is it, Smuggler's Cove?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even remember all the different
names of these places, but this is where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're heading and we're gonna be making
our way there now, so won't you join me?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Sunshine Coast bound,
here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now we just head down the
one main street here that is the street to
[SPEAKER_02]: be on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gibson's Way is the one we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be turning onto Gibson's Way
and this street takes you all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: through right to the end to the ferry that
will take you to Powell River and Lund and
[SPEAKER_02]: that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Sunshine Coast and you can
drive down this road for god, it's gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: be over an hour before you get to Earl's
Cove, which is the ferry at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: this road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go through Gibson's, you go
through Roberts Creek, and you go through
[SPEAKER_02]: Seychelt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna be taking Gibson's Way here
just in a little bit less than half a
[SPEAKER_02]: mile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful up here on the Sunshine Coast
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real different vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right away you land and you just feel more
of this sort of island vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we're not on the island,
we're on the mainland, it's still a ferry
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not able to drive their cars,
so it makes for a pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: cool vibe on the coast, no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here on the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally made it here and I'm here with
Stratosphere Glass and Corey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corey Cotton, I'm in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me up, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got up and it was rainy and gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like drove to the Horseshoe Bay
Ferry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all just this real sort of somber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened halfway here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally halfway here it was like,
the clouds all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got up this morning, it was shining here
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's nice for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breakfast too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we went to, what was that,
the Angry Chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a pretty good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are ever in Gibson,
go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely hammered out some really
nice breakfasts for a pretty darn good
[SPEAKER_02]: price for four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we filled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already hung out a little bit and
puffed some bowls and they've showed me a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of glass, but I thought,
you know what, why don't we sit down,
[SPEAKER_02]: have a little discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really get to talk about the glass
scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that much on my channel,
so it's nice to be able to hang out with a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of veteran glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys have been blowing glass
for a while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still remember going down to the melting
point when you had your shows and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time and pretty inspirational when
you're getting into the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I can only imagine, because to me it
was just happening all around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we don't realize when we look
back at things like that, at how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, these communities are so small
that eventually when that small community,
[SPEAKER_02]: you travel 25 years into the future and
they're, you know, these are well-known
[SPEAKER_02]: artists now who are in museums and
capturing prices for their glass that you
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of can't even fathom from a
layman standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's quite something when you're in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't realize that it's like all these
amazing artists were involved in that
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, you had a great collection in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pretty inspirational people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give it up to Slinger because he
was really, you know, I say that we both
[SPEAKER_02]: curated that show, but in a sense when it
comes to the art, really Slinger curated
[SPEAKER_01]: that show in the sense that he knew every
one of those blowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to drool over that yeast piece,
the donut penetrated red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the bowl at the top,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bowl actually comes through the
penetration because it's almost got this
[SPEAKER_02]: weird, like not a pendant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a part of the piece, but it's like
pushed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it because I used to put hash on
my pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the pieces that I have to
admit that I was a little bit bummed that
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get, you know, because the color
on that thing as well was just absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Slinger being like,
hey, you know, Jason wants to do a piece
[SPEAKER_02]: with this guy, Steve Hopps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many people know who he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can he be in the glass show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, oh, I've got this friend, Bear Claw.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's never been in a show before,
but he's really, he's on point and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, can we bring him in?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like to be the responsible,
to be one of the people who were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, yeah, let's bring this guy in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, once again,
look back 10 to 15 years later and see
[SPEAKER_02]: where some of these guys are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's been pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, you know, as a hash guy,
I really have to give it up to the oil in
[SPEAKER_02]: how it seemed to induce this frenzy of
collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you guys not agree that somewhere
along the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a futuristic thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to have a rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not your standard thing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's cables and plugs and wires and
carbs and, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys take it a step further
with your, with moving glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that you guys have sort of,
you know, what, what kind of brought you
[SPEAKER_02]: to the fact that you wanted to see glass
moving on your pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, to me as, as a glass user,
there's been lots of other people who made
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that'd be, had some pretty cool
ones that are kind of an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some from Dan LaSalle back in the day with
spinners on his pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be able to play with your glass
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just that extra little bit
of function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that more purpose to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like too, that things have gotten so
much more accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will, you can get so much,
you know, that perfect detail in where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can have that glass spinner spin so
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it cavitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they would call it in
the spin when, when the spin is not
[SPEAKER_02]: proper, when it's just, there's some
little bit off a little bit of problem in
[SPEAKER_02]: water through cavitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unbelievable what it'll make a boat
feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just taking the extra time and the
tediousness to make sure everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: lined up and straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lathe really helps out a lot with
it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely loving the spinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to show you some of those
guys, some of those pieces here in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just feeling so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sitting here right now in the sun
after a few nice bong rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunshine coast is the place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a different pace here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit of a different pace
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a really wonderful sort of
community that still exists within.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've always for 20 plus years,
I've come to the sunshine coast,
[SPEAKER_02]: see Shelton, Roberts Creek and Gibson,
and there's always been a really solid
[SPEAKER_02]: group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of, this is home to a lot of
artists and musicians around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting people for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys definitely have a few really good
studios on the sunshine coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a soft lab studio down the road
from us to your buddy Chris there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to go play, play in a soft shop
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrence McKenna said it's all about
cognitive activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can focus your brain on cognitive
activity and healing, they of course put
[SPEAKER_02]: the arts highly up in the cognitive
activity place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I guess we're gonna sit here for
a little bit longer off camera and enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: some conversation, but we'll take you guys
on a little tour of the shop here in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are in the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking good, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a couple of kilns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some pieces on display here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this first piece here is a collab
with Glass Monkey and myself.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks so beautiful in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the shining?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks so sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass Monkey made the dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the female goddess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All with tubes that we pulled out of the
crucible that the piece is sitting on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, she's rocking that naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the little bit of chain in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a cool addition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blocking it out with my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move our way on to this ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw this in Spain in Barcelona,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was on display in Spain while
we were there for a visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the spinner going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like an Illuminati tricycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spinner in this one's all little
faceted cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that color just is explosive in the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It glows pretty good under the black light
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did you guys finish this piece
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two days before we left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just two days before we left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's real, real, real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this piece, I saw a photo of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it was finished yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fanciest one we've made yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Temple of Pachamama.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also sort of tricycle design,
but we went pretty nuts on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go full out with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously delicate glass spinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the scarabs all over the piece,
little beetles and little butterflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful little trichome-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of a private collection right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still hanging out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably the most hours that
Stratis and I have ever put into one
[SPEAKER_01]: single piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: By far, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must have just started getting more and
more intense as you started stacking and
[SPEAKER_02]: building it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day, it's scarier and scarier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a point where you're just
hoping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went pretty smoothly though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely stoked to finishing this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of leaves you with nothing
to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: That cannabis leaf spinner is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are having fun with that,
I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were definitely having some high
fives finishing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a couple cold beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple cold beers for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in some long, long days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful work, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to the middle here and see
what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: This piece really grabs me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiery, orangey, red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proper spinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice thick base on it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this piece is made for the
sublimator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a nice dirty base to support
the unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only put my sublimator on pieces with
the thickest, most supportive bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this custom as well for the
sublimator?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got an extra long joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sublimator joint runs a little bit
longer than the average joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's made to fit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, those colors just pop in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the first machine elves piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: The machine elves.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that don't know what the
machine elves are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very tense, but kind of inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Self-reflecting machine elves that were
jumping in and out of his chest,
[SPEAKER_02]: telling him not to be amazed, but just to
do what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both these guys have their own spinner
hands going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spinning the molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this piece was produced in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we made this while we were visiting
Europe a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the first anyone's seen
of this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually going to have this up for
sale soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will be able to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are the collectors able to find
Stratosphere and Kory Glass?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the easiest place to locate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like Instagram these days is the
place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also email or kick Kory Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or my email is koryglass at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: K-O-R-U-Y Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nice to be able to definitely get in
touch with the blower direct when you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, if you guys are collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to add something like this to
your collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put those Instagram and Kicks across
the screen in the edit just in case you
[SPEAKER_02]: missed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love these little ones, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful work, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colors are just so, go so well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been loving the readies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixed match.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a few different ready stack.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that I guess that's kind of old
school now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little size pipe right there,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think that is about four inches?
[SPEAKER_01]: About that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and a half, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little triple penetrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more of a challenge to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little pieces go right through,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Superb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass always looks so great in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little naughty accents on this one,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems to be the most, all the rage right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice little piece right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I spend most of my time over
here at my bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a bunch of prep started over here for
our trip coming up to Roar in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, Frankenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sweet that you guys are going to
see Martin in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then shortly after, we are going to
Vienna to the Cultiva show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be doing a demo there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, at Cultiva?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where will be, I guess it will be
pretty easy to not miss if it's a glass
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing demo, it will be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being sponsored by Roar and Herbert
Arnold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flying us out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking care of all accommodations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sweet show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty excited to go do some work
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, yeah, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were showing me this little tool a
second ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the Herbert Arnold rollers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I probably had them about a year
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these things are cat's ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so nice for messy benches like
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I need to use them, I don't have
to clear out any space or have to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with moving my rollers around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's definitely sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, puppy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want us to play with your stick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Survived the coyote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a coyote survivor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another survivor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's fucking great to come and hang
out at your guys' shop and see the
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifulness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely have some great pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing what you guys
pull out in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think both of your jaws are going to
fall over when you see his kiln.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he already has a pretty nice shop,
so we're excited to go work with him,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Martin's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, new tools, more fun.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel blessed that I got to go for that
little tour, especially with Dizzle and
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopps, who were both just drooling as we
went from one room to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it seems like it's one building
after another building and they all just
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to be attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be dangerous like a kid in a
candy store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to want to buy all these tools
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to hold myself back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, bring cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, they'd probably take glass too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to ask you guys a little bit
about this crucible system that you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: got going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what exactly is going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our clear pot that we've been
pulling some canes from making readies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been putting these color plugs
and dunking them in here and then pull
[SPEAKER_00]: them out to a really, really, really long
skinny cane down the driveway,
[SPEAKER_00]: chip them all up and make readies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just heat that right up in the crucible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just solid glass in there right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big chunk of solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also been getting into mixing clear
with color in the crucibles too,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been getting good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited to play around a little more
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like a good thing to have under
your belt, the ability to sort of control
[SPEAKER_02]: and manipulate and produce your own color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to make prep in bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your own colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pulled, what was it, the 18 pounds or
19 pounds of tubes that we pulled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, two hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saves a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, boys.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, thank you guys for coming and
watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank these guys for walking us through
the glass shop, telling us what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you guys are pretty stoked to get
out of here and get headed over to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to be good times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too bad at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you guys are in Vienna,
first week of October at the Cultiva,
[SPEAKER_02]: go check these guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the glass blowing for
Herbert Arnold and Ruhr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have any idea what you're
going to be doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to figure it out once we're
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wait till you're on the ground
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that way all three of us are in the
same room and we can brainstorm a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better than over the phone.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's the way to do it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come up with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as always, I'm going to finish this
show with a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And say thank you guys for having me out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real pleasure for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love the Sunshine Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you guys in the next one.
