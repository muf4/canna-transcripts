[SPEAKER_05]: Hey everybody!
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy New Year 2025!
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Hash Church Season 11,
Episode 1.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a little jump, not gonna lie,
we were at 5.0 and we went to 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, these were,
you know, they weren't, the first Hash
[SPEAKER_05]: Church went for, I think, four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a break, I did Hash Point 2.0,
I took a little break again, we did 3.0,
[SPEAKER_05]: so anyway, just so you know, you're not
confused, we're now in Season 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna let in some of the folks that
are sitting and waiting in the room,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah, Happy New Year and welcome
everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got a bunch of people here already
available this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome everybody, welcome Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puffing on that doobie.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, blessed rising.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, welcome to Caitlin from High
Fidelity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Representing with the feminine energy in
the Hash-making world, we appreciate you,
[SPEAKER_05]: we appreciate you Caitlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get yourself in there, she's trying to get
her, get her connection and do the,
[SPEAKER_05]: make the audio work and I know it well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome Hemp Guy, Mr. Skunkman Sam,
in the house early on a Sunday morning,
[SPEAKER_05]: really, probably 6pm in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but yeah, that was right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got Steven Philpott Jr. back in the
house, he's connecting to audio.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a wonderful guest the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Etienne introducing him as
studying trichome morphology and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, wow, what can you really study?
[SPEAKER_05]: But wow, Steven, let us know what you can
really study.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had amazing photos from the electron
scan microscope and we went into that a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit, so that was really fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got about 50 people live right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that'll climb pretty good in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello to Persephone Lux and Buddy Weeds
and Lord Sav, John Maddox and Sam Seth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arne Casper Samuelson, welcome brethren.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Bingo Lombardi holding it
down in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we got Wolverine Dabs and Etienne
Fontaine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's church, I invited a ton of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's about 30 of us that I invited.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if we'll get all of that or
if we'll get a fraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: of that or what, but I thought kind of a
fun New Year's church would be to just
[SPEAKER_05]: have everyone come in, talk about what
they did for New Year's, talk about the
[SPEAKER_05]: hash that they're smoking, and most
importantly, talk about the vision for
[SPEAKER_05]: 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, we make up a big
chunk of the hash community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, you can always tell when Etienne is
in a different place than his normal hash
[SPEAKER_05]: church place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell, dude, you look fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look like you're somewhere different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you somewhere different?
[SPEAKER_07]: I am somewhere different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm away for the New Year and just
relaxing and enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to see a lot of familiar faces
and welcome to 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, welcome as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to you, Belle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to see you.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Representing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like you know, low key repping the
jiu-jitsu constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's always been a that was part of my
life before it was part of hash making.
[SPEAKER_13]: So well, it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you've taken the discipline that
you learned in jiu-jitsu and transferred
[SPEAKER_05]: it over into the hash making world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll tell you what, Marcus tells you
not to give up really.
[SPEAKER_13]: It like our industry is really hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be very defeating.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it can be you can go through
your torch and pitchforks on both sides,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and it can be discouraging.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all tapped out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I come close a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just can't give up.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't let people grind you down.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's the hardest of hardest
situations, man, when you're getting like
[SPEAKER_13]: manhandled or womanhandled.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I was like, oh, my God, that woman
just handled me like she like picked me
[SPEAKER_13]: up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Handled me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, it really humbles you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It humbles.
[SPEAKER_13]: It humbles you a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And but in like, you know, it's hot in the
room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody's pushing on you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're under a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It it sometimes you can't even breathe.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you're in a lot of pain,
but you got to like push through and
[SPEAKER_13]: persevere and just keep going.
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes you it's unbelievable what
the human spirit can can achieve.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you think you're just done for.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then all of a sudden you're in a tiny
little opening.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the same for hash making is
it's like, dude, I'm just I don't even
[SPEAKER_13]: know why the fuck I do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: But like, you know, there's somebody that
comes up to you like this girl one time
[SPEAKER_13]: was like, you know, you're the reason I
make hash bill.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, OK, you know, like that's why
we do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do it so we can pass on pass on the
knowledge so we can keep on going.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something good for the youth.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something very important about the
humility aspect of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like the more we practice
humility, I guess the I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just easier when you practice
humility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a Mike Tyson quote,
which obviously came after he lifted the
[SPEAKER_05]: butane, the beat, the but the frog,
the M.E.O.
[SPEAKER_05]: frog, the bufo teen frog calling it a
butane frog.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he said, if you are not humble in this
world, this world will dress humility upon
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, before that, before he licked the
butane frog, it was everyone has a plan
[SPEAKER_05]: until they get punched in the face.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like the original Mike Tyson
quote.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it got all it got all default.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like old school, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then it got deep and it got
psychedelic and it got like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the shallows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very true.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are not humble in this world,
this world will dress humility upon you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a bad thing to practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have some humble pie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you eat humble pie, you might not
have to eat big plate loads of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my advice to the world for 2025.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually copyrighted humility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's everyone smoking today?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I got this like I guess this would
be considered an elite back from the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old mothership ball rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a little buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got like seven of these things there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just not quite where I'm sure this
thing must have cost like twenty five
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand dollars when it was originally
purchased.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably worth like five or six
thousand now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to say it has been a beauty for
puffing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a ton of full mouth bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some 90 micron death bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some 90 micron event horizon,
which that event horizon is quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's from exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I've got some masterpiece,
90 micron.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got a couple of Yeezy O jeans
and an MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_05]: All sieved, air dry, you know,
six star melt into nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't had a ton of melty bubble
in my life lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so good to have it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want everyone to have melty hash
all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is my dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone needs it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you still want to smoke spliffs
and BHO and whatever else you're enjoying
[SPEAKER_05]: in your life, at least have some full melt
dry sift or some full melt bubble in the
[SPEAKER_05]: in the quiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I would say to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to welcome Logan into the
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wolverine Dabs, one of our young hash
makers who's, you know, making waves and
[SPEAKER_05]: making us think and showing us different
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had those amazing photos you showed
with the crystallized gland heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that in all the years that I've
been doing this, and certainly it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: fraction of the years that Sam's been
doing this, there's just still new things
[SPEAKER_05]: to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's new things to be unveiled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really have an appreciation for you
for doing that, Logan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've scheduled to go back to Oregon as
well to go get my hands on that same
[SPEAKER_17]: strain so we can get some data.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can test it all over that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one that sort of just
crystallized the heads and turned them
[SPEAKER_05]: into into dust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the trop santos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if there was like a particular pH
of water that was used to wash that and
[SPEAKER_05]: whether or not that pH had anything to do
with that, that process.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it was all dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was dry sifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm excited to go back down there,
get my hands on the same phenol and see if
[SPEAKER_17]: it replicates it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, if it doesn't replicate it,
then it had something to do with the grow
[SPEAKER_17]: environment or the age of the trichomes as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just one of the other 10,000 variables
that we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick is laughing because it's like,
holy shit, it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're young, you're just so like,
yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you start realizing, oh,
my God, how many variables could there
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly be?
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, geez, man, it really could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I wanted to welcome Dr. Mark Sheldone
and to say a heartwarming happy birthday
[SPEAKER_05]: to the Hash Church alumni.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, four nights at Madison Square Garden
with Fish, sending me videos, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how many friends I have at Fish?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's only one who sends me
perfectly like filmed multi-minute videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: No shaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you know, he's tripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's stoned out of his gourd.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just filming these perfect
videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Views from Section 109, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, as you call it, the most
incredible arena in the world,
[SPEAKER_18]: the most famous arena in the world.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_18]: Madison Square Garden is just an
incredible room.
[SPEAKER_18]: And man, they killed it, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_18]: They kill it every time in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just so much fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: And shout out to, I met some hash makers
there who I introduced Hash Church to.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Rob, who works at the midstation at
Stratton Mountain here in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Rob, I hope you're watching.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you're learning all kinds of cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, Marcus, it's so cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't wait till I look in the seat next
to me and see you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's make it happen in 2025,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't be in the seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll actually be on the ground in front of
the seat doing a psychedelic seizure.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll be floating in midair, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, it's been a very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you that don't know,
I'm a huge fish head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fish is a huge part of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made it happen in the early or mid 90s,
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just sort of petered out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally been, I don't know,
20 to 25 years since I saw a fish show,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is, I feel like out of all the
things I got robbed from this record,
[SPEAKER_05]: from having a record and not being allowed
into the U S I feel like the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_05]: and fish were some, I mean that,
and obviously my community, all of you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys that I could be visiting and go and
make hash with Bell down in California and
[SPEAKER_05]: go see Nickety and go see Scott.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I can't do that at this point in
time, but the waiver is in hopefully in
[SPEAKER_05]: the next six to eight months, I'll be my
American tour and cruise around America
[SPEAKER_05]: and say, see what you guys got going on
down there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you are known throughout this
community, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have people who would stop me at a fish
show and want to take a selfie with me
[SPEAKER_18]: because they know me from hash church.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's like, Oh, there's Dr. Mark,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: And people would like lay stuff on me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Even like Sam, who's in the chat right
here.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's like, Oh, I saw him at biz con,
you know?
[SPEAKER_18]: And whenever I see people, they're always
so gracious about, you know, Well,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's, you know, we've had a tremendous
reach in this program.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_18]: We're 10, 11 years old now.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go back to our late departed friend
Horatio, who first introduced me to you
[SPEAKER_18]: and invited me into the room and said,
you know, Tony Vazir is talking shit on
[SPEAKER_18]: terpings.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to come in and, you know,
clean this conversation up.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a, it's been a long,
strange trip, but, uh, Marcus,
[SPEAKER_18]: now that you're back in, or you're able to
come to United States, dude, let's
[SPEAKER_18]: seriously put some plans together to,
uh, to go on fish tour this year.
[SPEAKER_18]: And maybe we could even do it over a
weekend where we could do a hash church
[SPEAKER_18]: episode from like a hotel room in between
shows or something.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, let's see if we can do that,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would be the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there will be about half of Toronto's
Jewish community with us on that tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've, I've promised all of them already.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dear friend, Alison Gordon and Amy
Weinstein and all those just absolute
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome tripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was Alison Gordon who got me
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: She got me to try and go down to Portland
for the legends of hash that I w that I
[SPEAKER_05]: did with Addison down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's when I actually, I was at the
border.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at us customs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alison was like, already went through.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to know Alison, but it was like,
her will is so strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has this incredible will that when she
wants to do something, it always gets
[SPEAKER_05]: done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when us customs started to deny me,
her head literally started to explode.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's walking back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's kind of already cleared customs and
kind of needs to bug her off, but she
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she stands there for the entire hour
and a half that I'm delayed staring
[SPEAKER_05]: through the glass at me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the customs are kind of like,
Hey, you, you got to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywhere I'm waiting for my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, when they deny me,
she's like, well, I'm not getting on my
[SPEAKER_05]: plane.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, well, you're already in
the U S basically, like you can't,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they had not met Alison Gordon.
[SPEAKER_05]: She absolutely came back.
[SPEAKER_05]: She did not get on that flight and she
ended up driving me home later that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were going to go see dead and co at
the sphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: She had tickets for us at the sphere right
after Portland.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's going to be with us on that
little tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should welcome, uh, Davis Allen,
uh, another young dude who's doing some
[SPEAKER_05]: good things here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been on hash church, uh, at least one
or two times with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing Davis?
[SPEAKER_19]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been an amazing start to the year for
sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are you at right now?
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, just finishing up the, one of the
projects at UBC.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then again, just that, uh,
the family's property right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, like Bowen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Davis is on the most amazing little
island.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like just outside of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just across the ocean from my little
place in lions Bay.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on a little Island called Bowen
Island.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's surrounded by like whales and
dolphins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just one of the special,
and he grew up there, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you meet a ton of people that
live on Bowen Island, but they could
[SPEAKER_05]: literally be from anywhere else in the
world other than British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Davis is one of the lucky ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got to grow up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're doing the, the UBC project
still.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're finishing up the, um,
fertility project currently.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just, uh, I'm starting to measure
all the plants, check how many seeds are
[SPEAKER_19]: developed from different varieties and
crosses.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we're going to be starting some
new projects, hopefully in the next few
[SPEAKER_19]: months here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, I think that you and Steven
Philpott should exchange, uh, numbers and
[SPEAKER_05]: link up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you guys would really have some
great synergies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're both brilliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're both Uber focused.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I think what he's doing,
and what you're doing, there'll somehow be
[SPEAKER_05]: some synergies in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure that, uh, I put you guys
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only met Steven recently through
Etienne, uh, who brought him in,
[SPEAKER_05]: who also brought in Caleb Chen today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to welcome Caleb.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Caleb?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've ever met, but welcome
to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_10]: Feels great to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, thank you very much for the invite.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, happy new year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing, Mark?
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Caleb, uh, I'll let you tell the story,
Caleb.
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, it was, dude, we were just talking
about this, getting called out at meetings
[SPEAKER_18]: and public events for being on Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_18]: But go ahead, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, at MJ BizCon last month, I ran into
Dr. Scaldone there and was able to share
[SPEAKER_11]: some of the Vietnamese hash from First Cut
Farms with him.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very, very fun time.
[SPEAKER_18]: We stunk up the joint, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember that, that, well, was it a joint
that you smoked with me or?
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: We rolled some hash holes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hash hole.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a shout out to, uh, First Cut Farms
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for shouting him out.
[SPEAKER_13]: That guy's a legend.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jerry, just shout out to you, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was, uh, Dennis Perrone's,
one of Dennis Perrone's growers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, thank you for always keeping it
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jerry, if you're watching, I appreciate
you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to cut you guys off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Caleb's part of our science group and
he's, uh, one of the young, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: another one of the young, brilliant
scientists, um, uh, social scientists
[SPEAKER_07]: around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been doing a fascinating research,
um, his own personal research on,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, music, uh, genetics and how they have
intertwined.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to explain a little bit of
that, Caleb, for the, uh, the public?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm sitting here at Cal Poly Humboldt
in the cannabis studies lab, and,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, I'm a master's in public sociology
student.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is, um, you know, it's not a wet
lab.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like a hash lab, like Bell gets
to work with down at Heritage.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not, um, like a lab where we can
touch cannabis or do any breeding like
[SPEAKER_11]: Davis Allen can do up at UBC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and so, you know, in the sociology
department, this is though the very first
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis studies program in the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's, you know, there's cohorts
of cannabis studies, bachelor's,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, majors, cannabis studies majors here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I get to, uh, be a research assistant
with them on the legacy genetics grant
[SPEAKER_11]: with Dr. Dominic Corva.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before my thesis, um, I'm looking at
changes in cannabis genetics over time,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm doing so by interviewing cannabis
breeders, but I'm also doing archival
[SPEAKER_11]: research because, you know, everyone here,
I think has a love of music and,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, through music, I've learned a lot
about weed and, um, definitely there's a
[SPEAKER_11]: connection there that you can straight up
track which cultivars have been popular
[SPEAKER_11]: where, where they first popped up.
[SPEAKER_11]: All this sort of stuff is just sitting
there on, you know, the internet archives
[SPEAKER_11]: in lyric databases.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's all sorts of insights into our
cannabis culture that can be shared
[SPEAKER_11]: through that, you know, not just in hip
hop or through fish or the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_11]: or there's literally anything and
everything y'all can think of,
[SPEAKER_11]: including I've learned about some um,
like hash music from Greek music.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing some in IT actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: This must be right up your alley,
Nikati, because you've been doing music
[SPEAKER_05]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a cool concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, so, so what exactly is it that you're
connecting?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like frequencies and vibrations,
or is it like, oh, certain areas have
[SPEAKER_05]: certain cultivars and they also have
certain music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you putting these sort of underlining
connections that other people haven't made
[SPEAKER_05]: so far?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what's the, what's the sort of thesis
of the work?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one, um, presentation I'm going to be
making in March at the Pacific
[SPEAKER_11]: sociological association conference in San
Francisco is titled, uh, how Cali weed
[SPEAKER_11]: became a world star, um, a lyrical
analysis of hip hop songs from 1980s to
[SPEAKER_11]: 2020s.
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically by searching on lyrical
databases for the words Cali weed,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, I found 240 source songs that
mentioned Cali weed in the lyrics
[SPEAKER_11]: directly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I were to ask everyone here,
like, you know, what country you think
[SPEAKER_11]: those songs are from the majority of them,
what would people guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: USA.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for the last 10 years, most songs
mentioned in Cali weed are actually coming
[SPEAKER_11]: out of Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how that's like German hip hop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And German reggae and stuff like seed seed
with three E's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those are just like, it's a big market
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of Cali weed, you know, and that is as
many people here know, it's kind of a,
[SPEAKER_11]: an older slang term now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, on hash shirts, people might know
about Cali plates, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: where things are moving to and there's
lyrical references to that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to rip a dab here.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to finish up the story when,
when Caleb came and got me high at,
[SPEAKER_18]: at biz con.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the three people or the four of us
that were sitting at the bench.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Murphy Murray, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, was Miyabi there?
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it was twinkle twinkle, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Twinkle from abstracts myself and Kayla,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're sitting, we're sitting out on
this bench and it was basically known,
[SPEAKER_18]: well, it's a weed conference.
[SPEAKER_18]: So people are probably going to just step
outside the door and start smoking and
[SPEAKER_18]: everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: But there was this kind of maintenance
crew that was sitting on a fork truck that
[SPEAKER_18]: was just across the way from us.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we didn't have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we, Caleb, did we have to ask those
gentlemen for a lighter?
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had one and they had one because
they were all smoking cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_18]: right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So we light up this, this, this torch and
it just, uh, it just was stinky to all
[SPEAKER_18]: hell.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, it was great weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: It got me totally high.
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, I want to appreciate you,
Caleb, for reaching out to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was a fun little interaction that
we had there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think I took a bunch of photos from
it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you reach back out to me,
I could send you some of the photos.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think, yeah, there was a photo of me,
you, Murray and twinkle sitting there
[SPEAKER_18]: getting high outside biz con right after
my talk.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think was that after?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was just after.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I, I gave a talk there markets on,
um, synthetic cannabinoids and,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, all this, uh, chemistry that's
going on to basically convert CBD and
[SPEAKER_18]: so-called CBD into other, you know,
cannabinoids that are basically,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, for sale is all kinds of
different products and gas stations and on
[SPEAKER_18]: the internet and not having the regulatory
auspices that most of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis industry has to go through.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a whole, you know, train wreck
down here in the States that you guys
[SPEAKER_18]: probably aren't dealing with so much in,
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our own train wrecks we're dealing
with up here.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's as, you know, many people would say
it's the proverbial race to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, and what the cannabis industry
has turned into, I'm thinking about,
[SPEAKER_18]: um, JJ's, uh, post on Facebook,
uh, from, uh, from top dog was basically
[SPEAKER_18]: just saying, you know, where the
industry's gone in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's basically gone to, you know,
mids that can be produced at, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: shit ton quantity, uh, and then just goose
with whatever to get people high.
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, I think I had reported back on
biz con this year being kind of like
[SPEAKER_18]: pre-roll con.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything was about pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything was about pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's like every three boots or every
like third booth was, uh, either selling
[SPEAKER_18]: tubes or custom papers or pre-roll
machines or all about pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the majority of those
companies are using the cheapest super
[SPEAKER_18]: sack hemp they possibly can get.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, putting some THC isolate in
there and calling it cannabis,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, that's what our industry has
become today, you know, proverbial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you have a bunch of immature,
like new buyers that are just,
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't really know it'll take them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I just, you know, I got into this
pretty hardcore, not, not quite right
[SPEAKER_05]: away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked my first joint at 14,
but by 17, I was definitely like both feet
[SPEAKER_05]: in like flipping pounds and like just
going as deep as I possibly could.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that now, because it's not
illegal, people can get into it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they can stay shallow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to go so deep and be like,
Oh wow, this isn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else am I not allowed to know about
this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just like, and so it's going to
take a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I can hear your heartbreaking when
you say what you just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know all of our hearts break for
that too, but we just have to remain
[SPEAKER_05]: resilient and stay true to our path and
continue with quality and purity and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the education, because I just,
I can't believe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And personally, I'm good with a smaller
percentage of the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can just feed a small group of
people, people who are really happy to
[SPEAKER_05]: receive what I'm, what I'm putting out
there, then that's, that's good enough for
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the world is so big, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh, Canada did like 3.5 billion in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not even a big cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan alone did like 200 million more
than the Canadian cannabis market in a,
[SPEAKER_05]: in an entire year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just Canada and Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got like all these other States and
countries, and it's just going to grow and
[SPEAKER_05]: grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately the, if you just,
if you just want to make a ton of money
[SPEAKER_05]: and you want to, uh, I mean, fuck it's
almost sick, but if you, if you were like
[SPEAKER_05]: a hurting scene and you want it to start
an amazing brand and you really believed
[SPEAKER_05]: in it, you should almost start a brand
that sells floor sweepings, distillate and
[SPEAKER_05]: botanical terpenes in pre-rolled joints
with the thickest nastiest paper you could
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it real ugly, gaudy packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have the number one brand like in
the kind of genetics because they don't
[SPEAKER_09]: track seeds still.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we stop with the cone pre-rolls?
[SPEAKER_07]: They royally suck and about a half inch to
an inch above it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets so clogged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we just go back to the, if you're
going to, if you have to do pre-rolls,
[SPEAKER_07]: you son of a bitches, can you at least
make it regular and even like how they do
[SPEAKER_07]: with cigarettes so that people can get an
even at least hit if you have to fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: go there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd prefer you fucking not, but can you
stop with the fucking cones you
[SPEAKER_07]: motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think of the pre-rolls as like fishing
lures, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just out there looking to like get
people into weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like check this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I'm not overly confident
smoking full melt bubble with people that
[SPEAKER_05]: have never smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do the micro dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got, I pull a pin out because any other
dabber is too big and pulls too much out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if no one's ever had a dab before I'll
pull the pin out and I'll be, I'll hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just the first dab, they blow it
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They taste it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're almost nobody gets high off that,
but they've, they're now on the other side
[SPEAKER_05]: of their fear that they had about this
experience that they've seen people
[SPEAKER_05]: whiting out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've seen people grabbing the red hot
bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've seen all of these ways that you
can fuck up and they're nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't blow torches and all this other
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once you give them that little micro
dab and they can be on the other side of
[SPEAKER_05]: it, then it's like, well, I can give you
another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can even give you another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I take a dab with this,
I can't ungive it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be high for like at least
45 minutes to an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, although for whatever reason,
I think I thought it was hilarious in my
[SPEAKER_05]: twenties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like offended by it in my
fifties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, this is knocking people out
and making people uncomfortable is the
[SPEAKER_05]: worst thing you could do for the extracts
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you're begging for it and you're
saying, Hey, I want to be uncomfortably
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, deliver that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: A half gram hot dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he just asked for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, another trend that's happening down
here.
[SPEAKER_18]: And even though it's still a small market
sector, it's growing exponentially is
[SPEAKER_18]: beverage and beverage doesn't give a shit
about strain.
[SPEAKER_18]: All they need is 10 milligrams of THC and
they don't care where that THC came from,
[SPEAKER_18]: whether it came from a reaction vessel or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually came from a plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so there you have big money because in
order to have canning facilities,
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, think about it like this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big beverage is already all set up to do
this.
[SPEAKER_18]: The nano emulsification of THC now gives
them just another ingredient to drop in to
[SPEAKER_18]: their big production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also, it also state, while I wouldn't
say it completely stabilizes, it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: most stable cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they want to stabilize flour and
hash and oils, but that's, you can't,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can slow it down and put it in a cold
chain, but like, it's not stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally volatile.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's the word used to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_18]: But where they have considerable tailwinds
pushing them into this market is they have
[SPEAKER_18]: these huge distribution channels,
Marcus, and they're outside needing,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, a cannabis license.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like in Minnesota and I think now in Texas
and a few other states, you can sell these
[SPEAKER_18]: things at the liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, 10 milligram drinks and,
you know, more, more than 10 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_18]: but, but I mean, like, so how do you
compete with that?
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't compete with that, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Like AT&T, do you sell beverages at your
store?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, do you got, do people come in and
buy beverages there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they do, but they can go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Up the street to Bev Mo and you know,
at the end of the aisle by, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the same drinks for probably much cheaper
because they don't have to deal with the
[SPEAKER_07]: licensing and all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we do, but not like we used to
because they're up the street for cheaper
[SPEAKER_07]: in a regular store.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and cheap, that, that, that matters,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if you're spending, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: If a consumer is going to $8 for a four
pack or $5 for a four pack, but people are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to drive that a little extra to save
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ours, ours are $8 a can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or one can, $8.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now listen to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to hear how fucked the
Canadian cannabis regulatory framework is,
[SPEAKER_05]: was, whatever, it just shows you
everything's topsy turvy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the same way, unfortunately,
the police flipped the law upside down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawyers flipped the law upside down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doctors flipped health upside down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're living in the topsy turvy world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when cannabis became legal in
Canada, the first thing to become a part
[SPEAKER_05]: of the cold chain, where like you'd go
into a store and there'd be like a little
[SPEAKER_05]: fridge and you'd be like, Oh, they're
keeping it cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing in the fridge was beverages
with 10 milligrams of distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no volatile organic compounds,
no aromatic compounds, just distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only thing in the store
that's cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else in it on the shelves in
the, in the back is all at room
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole store, of course,
reeks like weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, Oh, that smells so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the person behind the counter is
like, yeah, it doesn't it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm like, it's too bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not still in the product I was going
to buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're like, Oh, it's like,
that's a one way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like cold chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be in like the center of Canada in
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy would be like, well,
that's expensive to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, bro, you live in
Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like minus 40 degrees, eight months
of the year here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just put a hole in your roof and pull the
air from outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's the cold chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything else, I pray that the cannabis
industry figures out the cold supply chain
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's gotta be, that's a pretty
difficult thing to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you've done everything right
from growing the cannabis to harvesting
[SPEAKER_05]: it, to processing it, to getting it
packaged and ready for market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then someone leaves that shit in a
warehouse that's like 96 degrees in the
[SPEAKER_05]: shade for the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a long weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Canada, you guys have like a central
distro and I did some consulting for them
[SPEAKER_09]: on what temperatures they should be
keeping their products at actually,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully that does change soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're all provincial too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, you've got the AGCL and the
ALG.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Alberta one.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the OCS in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the BCLDB in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each province has their own one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know they're going to figure it out
eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it has to work because I know
they do it for like spinach and cucumbers
[SPEAKER_05]: and tomatoes and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't just send that stuff at room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's very small margins on that
product compared to the margins that are
[SPEAKER_05]: available on our product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has to be an affordable option.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Caitlin, don't you want your shit
to be preserved right to the day someone
[SPEAKER_12]: cracks it open and takes a rail?
[SPEAKER_12]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somehow we ended up the lucky one in BC
and the BC provincial board is the body
[SPEAKER_12]: that sells our product across the country.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for some reason, they've chosen us as
the ones that they're going to keep cold,
[SPEAKER_12]: but they won't keep us in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll keep us in the coldest section of
their warehouse, which makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: So by the time the product gets to the
consumer, it's not what left my building,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a second delivery option where we
can ship from my facility to stores
[SPEAKER_12]: directly, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So those ones stay cold.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how I know the stores that know
the premium product, because they know
[SPEAKER_12]: they're purchasing from me, from my fridge
and putting it into their fridge,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is what we need to happen across the
board.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can't convince Ontario to put our
product in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a pretty crazy product if
someone invented the stakeholder jar that
[SPEAKER_05]: was some sort of like advanced technology,
wasn't wasteful and detrimental to the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment because I can already see the
comments in the YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_05]: But wow, wouldn't that just be a dream?
[SPEAKER_05]: You just had a jar that you could like
just set the temperature on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever you opened it, it was just
like a cool, that's honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're like, we have to do a significant
amount of secondary packaging.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can send you my jar, but I can send
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to go in this because of all these
warning labels.
[SPEAKER_12]: But maybe if this package could keep the
jar cold, that would be pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be so sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow, some way it would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Direct to consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Direct to consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it's the only way to like
really control.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to, I teach my clients not
to launch with melt or fresh press.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless they have a direct to consumer
model just because there's no control over
[SPEAKER_09]: it unless you have that control.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a hash maker, we need that control.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like certain direct to consumer
models are the only way to go with those
[SPEAKER_09]: unstable products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that the Piatela, if you do
have a six star and you want to stabilize
[SPEAKER_05]: it somewhat, if you turn it into Piatela,
I mean, that's basically buttered out
[SPEAKER_05]: sugary resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's shippable, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some on my counter here for months
and it pretty much stayed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It dried out a little over time and became
a little less terpy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, it kept its sort of
foamy, hashy look.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which goes back to, you know, temple balls
and a lot of the other technology in our
[SPEAKER_09]: history of being able to, you know,
import, export, transport that material.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it just kind of, it's a nice
throwback.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that Piatela has kind of brought it
back to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, this might be my rose tinted
glasses, but I just miss that,
[SPEAKER_13]: that deli style.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like this is coming from someone who has a
bunch of packaging like you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's, it's crazy, you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: And like, I miss like having the
relationship with the bud tender and they
[SPEAKER_13]: like you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they'll give you the fat nug.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, I got you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see that fat nug in that jar.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, you know, like back in the day,
you know, back in the day, people used to
[SPEAKER_13]: just cut our hash out for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they, you bring the ball,
you sell the ball as is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss doing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to sell the ball as is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is up to you, how you store that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you fuck it up, that's not my
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have people all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how do you, you know, cure your hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like do you cure it in the fridge?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll be like, well, that's more of a
preserve in the fridge, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you want to off gas some of your
volatile organic compounds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you think the ones underneath might
be better or are you of the school that
[SPEAKER_05]: you want every last one?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not wasting a single one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are very different schools and
they're, they're very stubborn each side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can't convince one side of the
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both are, I'm kind of in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate both sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I do appreciate a very nice cured full
mount or dry sip, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll smash something that was freshly made
and has all the caustic monoturps in there
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grabbing me by the back of my throat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what do y'all think about Argon?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I know, you know, this is a
solventless group, but I've been seeing a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of, uh, really cool results from,
uh, utilizing Argon to remove oxygen in
[SPEAKER_09]: the environment and stop oxidization.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was originally a mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: People were talking 80%, um, nitrogen,
20% CO2, but when they found is that the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, when it degrades in the
containers, because that's what happens in
[SPEAKER_07]: California, it actually turns to CO2.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the change to nicotine was to Argon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that way it was another stable,
uh, inert gas, uh, to stabilize that with
[SPEAKER_07]: the nitrogen seems to be better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That way, if you read any, um,
CO2, you know that it's the degradation of
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where science has recently
interacted, but I don't see a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: products that unfortunately do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish we had cold chain and that 80,
20 mix would stabilize.
[SPEAKER_18]: Argon is heavier than air, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So Argon pushes out.
[SPEAKER_18]: So air is 79% nitrogen, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's mostly nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_18]: What we're breathing, there's a little bit
of oxygen in there, but so Argon in a
[SPEAKER_18]: container, like if you're flushing out a
container, people like the blanket,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, uh, any product with,
yeah, even flour.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Nika, it's good to see you again,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so good to see you when you're up here
in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good to see your bearded face here on
camera.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Argon, which is more expensive than
nitrogen is heavier.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it'll actually volumetrically
displace everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's underneath it in a closed
container.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just more efficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been using a lot of my cold cure in
my parts.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, uh, for shelf stability,
it's been a fun little new toy,
[SPEAKER_09]: newer for me anyways.
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I used it 25 years ago in my dry suit
for scuba diving in the Pacific ocean in
[SPEAKER_05]: the wager.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you, when you, when you
regulate, with Argon because it's heavier,
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is weird because it would,
you're warmer with Argon gas regulating
[SPEAKER_05]: your buoyancy compensator, which basically
is your dry suit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, when you're dry suit diving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, I used Argon.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ocean's really cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's cold on top, but when you go
down like 20 or 30 feet, it gets wicked,
[SPEAKER_05]: wicked cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, dry suit, little Argon in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the heavier aspect of it just
makes the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the space between your body and the dry
suit warmer than cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Nick, I have a question you have to
be careful about.
[SPEAKER_18]: We should make sure everyone knows about
this is you can asphyxiate yourself.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can literally die by breathing Argon.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you took a balloon, like you were
sucking on a nitrous balloon and that was
[SPEAKER_18]: full of Argon and you suck that in,
you can die because it'll volumetrically
[SPEAKER_18]: displace all the air, which is the oxygen
in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_18]: And now it's going to take several
breathing cycles for you to completely
[SPEAKER_18]: clean that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, this is why our dry suits were
sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen lots of people knock themselves
out with nitrous oxide from breathing it
[SPEAKER_03]: straight without taking a pause with
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fished lot standard.
[SPEAKER_18]: But they could have not only died from
asphyxiation, when you have nitrous in
[SPEAKER_18]: your system, it starts affecting main
brainstem function, like your pulmonary
[SPEAKER_18]: function and your ability to breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a weird thing, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I broke my collarbone about four
months ago, I went to the hospital in
[SPEAKER_05]: Whistler and she was like, oh,
let me get you some pain meds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, I don't take those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, ooh, she's like,
this is a really painful break.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I know, I did it on this side
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys told me the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got our eyeballs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, okay, well, what about,
like, do you want some nitrous oxide?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, there's no amount you can do
of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she like wheels this nitrous oxide
tank into my, and I've never used nitrous
[SPEAKER_05]: oxide as a pain relief, but holy shit,
dude, this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't laughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just melted the shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in total shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had happened like 20 minutes prior.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just like in shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It melted the shock away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought it was the strangest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was like, here's the nitrous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she was like, and remember,
there's no amount you can do that can kill
[SPEAKER_05]: you or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I was just like, that's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's slightly a blend.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like you have some oxygen in there to make
sure that you're not going to die.
Maybe.
Probably.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_18]: When it's medically administered.
[SPEAKER_03]: In America, dentists have used it for
years.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got to also remember this just on the
chemistry side of thing that any other
[SPEAKER_18]: combination.
[SPEAKER_18]: So nitrous oxide is N2O, but any other
combination of nitrogen and oxygen is
[SPEAKER_18]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So NO2 is toxic.
[SPEAKER_18]: N2O2 toxic.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, all the other, you know,
possible compounds you could make between
[SPEAKER_18]: nitrogen and oxygen are really bad for
you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the reason why it works on pain,
Mark, is it does have some action at the
[SPEAKER_18]: pain receptors.
[SPEAKER_18]: Analgesic or something?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some type of analgesic function
that nitrous actually serves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can attest.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dentist has never used it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never taken it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might've tried a balloon in the
early nineties or something on tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't my vibe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was like, I was hitting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were laughing because every time you
hit it, it has a regulator mouthpiece that
[SPEAKER_05]: goes, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub,
bub, bub.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can hear it throughout the whole,
I'm like in a closed room and it started
[SPEAKER_05]: really like bub, bub, bub, bub,
bub, bub.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end it was like bub,
bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub,
[SPEAKER_05]: bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were giggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, Hey, you might want to go
take that oxygen, that tank away from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like bubble man getting down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I want to talk more about the Cali
weed and music thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you, Caleb, the most excited I
ever was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a huge connection to reggae music.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like my favorite music of all time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to have, to be sung about in a
reggae song was kind of like, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: like when, who, who's going to drop it,
right Etienne?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I played that tune.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it a Luton Fire, somebody from that
camp?
[SPEAKER_05]: Luton Fire did one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he did one called Sweet Trichome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Richie Spice did one called Dabin,
which is amazing because Richie Spice,
[SPEAKER_05]: the first time he ever went up to my rig
in Kingston, it was the straight fab that
[SPEAKER_05]: actually this friend, he has that straight
fab that I dabbed Richie out with in
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first time he ever saw it,
he was, you know, Richie is kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: quiet dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just like kind of in the background,
quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we brought him up to the pipe and he
didn't really know what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he blew on it and the water came up out
of the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a D-nail sick dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like, it was no, like if it was
a sapphire, ooh, that thing would have
[SPEAKER_05]: cracked right in half.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been a bad scene,
but it was the sick dish, the silicone
[SPEAKER_05]: carbide dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, dude, it's totally
doesn't matter at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can wipe this down.
[SPEAKER_05]: No harm done.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was the beginning of the first
time I ever dabbed him out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two years later, he wrote that
song Dabin, which is definitely,
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually got to in Jamaica at a concert,
go on stage with him and dab while he was
[SPEAKER_05]: singing that song.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, he's like, bubble man,
come dab, dab up on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, while I sing the song,
I was just like, this is fucking surreal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how many different things like that did
you look at Caleb?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just Cali weed right now sort of on
the surface or are you going a little
[SPEAKER_05]: deeper into sort of these certain terms
that catch on?
[SPEAKER_05]: And Germany, of all places, that's
interesting, which also has probably,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you would say,
Nicky T outside of California,
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the largest reggae followings on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got to be up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Japan, I mean, Japan loves Bob Marley,
but yeah, Germany is huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany is huge for reggae.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the pressings that I get from
Germany, the seven inch pressings are
[SPEAKER_09]: always way more high quality than any US
pressing, any Jamaican pressing.
[SPEAKER_09]: German vinyl is of another level.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're real audio files that come out of,
you know, German production, I feel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: German audio files.
[SPEAKER_05]: German audio files.
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_13]: The culture is pretty popular in Japan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, when I was a kid, I used to go
shopping at these little Rasta stores in
[SPEAKER_13]: Japan and it kind of, you wouldn't think,
but yeah, to your point, Nick,
[SPEAKER_13]: like they really do love their reggae
music and they're really good at it too.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have some really great groups that
come out of Japan and Korea.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think at Sierra Nevada, I don't know if
you were there, Nick, but one year at
[SPEAKER_13]: Sierra Nevada, there was this Korean
reggae band and they killed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the best shows I've seen,
but I wish I can remember their name,
[SPEAKER_13]: but that was fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sierra Nevada is a really fun reggae
festival that used to happen out here in
[SPEAKER_13]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've gone for two decades or some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really sad that it's not going to be
happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Sierra Nevada was like,
my stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like that's probably where we met
initially.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, probably, probably.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then you were like little,
little.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was really young.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, man, I, you know, like I was,
I was, you know, I was really like in my
[SPEAKER_13]: early twenties when, when you saw me
walking around with Frenchie everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think even before that, I think I'm
talking well before the Frenchie time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking like when I would,
you know, see your brother in the dance
[SPEAKER_09]: when we were teenagers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's probably when I first met
you, you were probably like real young.
[SPEAKER_09]: When would, when did you first start going
to Sierra?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, well, you might be confusing me for
somebody else just because I get that a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot in my town.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_13]: I get that a ton.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is somebody out here that looks like
me.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: I lived in Japan when I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew up overseas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually moved to the United States when
I was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that was the first time I was
seeing you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But my brother was here.
[SPEAKER_13]: My brother was, you know, my brother was
very young and here and you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: those were his stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely know your brother from back
then.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's cool though.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what a great show.
[SPEAKER_13]: And God, that Korean band was,
that was off the charts.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, I would, my jaw dropped to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were so good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Best reggae ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Need to find that band's name.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll put it in the comments later.
[SPEAKER_13]: Once I, once I find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the reggae music that includes
songs like skunk and haze and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, dude, your, your mark that you
put on the, the, the, I'm sure it is,
[SPEAKER_05]: is uncomparable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I first went to Amsterdam,
everything was skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one in like 95, it was,
it was every coffee shop was like skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haze Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, those were the standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the OGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Caleb, it was a, you were about to answer
before you, you missed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it this time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, with, uh, with reggae
specifically, um, you know, when they are
[SPEAKER_11]: singing about Cali weed, there's a portion
of time when it's not about California,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's Cali with the K right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or it's C O L L I E.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, that transition itself can be
viewed as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's very, and so for people that
don't know Cali with the K is referring to
[SPEAKER_11]: a Indian deity that is, you know,
patch related.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so like there are certain cultivars,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Cali mist with the K that you might
see people selling with the C and they're
[SPEAKER_11]: just getting the story wrong, arguably.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are also artists where,
you know, like for instance, Cali buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we would write there between reggae
and hip hop, where you can see like when
[SPEAKER_11]: early on in his career, he mentions Cali
weed with the K later on it's Cali weed
[SPEAKER_11]: with a C and you can see the context of
the mentions changing and everything like
[SPEAKER_11]: that across reggae artists and hip hop
artists.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even hip hop artists originally might have
been mentioning it with the K before,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, Cali really became online.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, it's very, to go off of what,
uh, Sam the skunk man was saying,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, I have been looking a lot also on like
specific cultivar mentions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sent him a, a very funny song about
skunk from the UK that, um, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_11]: send everyone else as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: The chorus basically goes, no,
he didn't sell me weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: He sold me skunk.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the whole song was about how skunk got
him way too high.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just hysterical that this kind of
stuff happens and it's totally part of the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this Cali weed analysis I did just
during this past summer, and um,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, there's like the small list of a
few hundred songs that have the explicit
[SPEAKER_11]: Cali weed mentioned, but I've got other
lists of like, you know, I've found like a
[SPEAKER_11]: hundred songs that are just about gelato.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's dozens of songs with the title
gelato, let alone, you know, talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: He wanted me to make them a gelato mix.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can definitely get that.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got it, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then like, so Hayes skunk you can see
is very much more popular out in Europe
[SPEAKER_11]: than for instance, there are other
cultivars that get wrapped about in
[SPEAKER_11]: America that then, you know, you kind of
see where the waves start, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, like OGs, uh, the perps.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also certain terms that go
beyond like the cultivar specific mentions
[SPEAKER_11]: where when you talk about smoking on blank
nowadays, you know, that could be beyond
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's all sorts of,
uh, you know, martial implications there
[SPEAKER_11]: as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you say that you're smoking on perhaps,
you know, some ops or something,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's all sorts of interesting slang and
slang music, the youth cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all part of this culture of
developing and being able to see it
[SPEAKER_11]: ongoing has really been, um, has really
been something.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Caleb, have you, have you seen,
uh, Billy strings video, California sober?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Epic, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: He basically shows up at Willie Nelson's
tour bus goes in there and smokes a couple
[SPEAKER_18]: of fatties and writes a song called
California sober with Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_18]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Billy's a big smoker.
[SPEAKER_18]: Billy's smokes during the middle of his
shows.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the guy is just probably the most
phenomenal guitar player on planet earth
[SPEAKER_18]: today.
[SPEAKER_18]: And smokes huge fatties during the middle
of the shows.
It's great.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember lots of time and reggae.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Kali, C O L I E.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I heard that for, for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Caleb, is that only referenced in
Jamaican music, the Kali before it became
[SPEAKER_07]: Kali weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, because to my knowledge, I only heard
it through, you know, reggae or dub style,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so probably like a patois version of
Kali, which came from the Indian culture,
[SPEAKER_09]: because there's so much Indian culture in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just, you know, there's that,
uh, Indo Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_11]: The coolies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_11]: The coolies everywhere they went,
they brought their ganja.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is the beginning of smoking
culture in a lot of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they also went where they went at
their own accord, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like becoming indentured slaves in
Jamaica, but they still got on the boats
[SPEAKER_05]: and pack their luggage.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not do that in Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Africans weren't grabbing cannabis seeds
and like recipes and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just getting like thrown onto
boats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indians were like packing suitcases and
like, Oh, we're going to live in a better
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty crazy how that,
that played out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Indian culture has a big footprint
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm convinced Jamaican patties are
flattened out samosas, like almost
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the whole, like all the, the,
the, like the, when you meet a dread in,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Jamaica that has like nine or 10 foot
long dreadlocks, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: He comes from India.
[SPEAKER_05]: His family is, is an Indian lineage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys grow dreadlocks, like nobody's
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then they can't grow facial hair
either.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a tinted skin and you know,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I mean, shit, like Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say it's, it's from that cultural
push.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in Suriname, same story.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were Indian indentured servants
that went to Cambodia as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, a lot of other places.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the earliest song that you have
found that has a reference to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I first started looking,
you know, it was just what I could find on
[SPEAKER_11]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was, it was limited also to like
English language stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I got to like some early
jazz songs, maybe the 1920s.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once I talked with Skunkman Sam
through you at TN, uh, learned about other
[SPEAKER_11]: older music that's not even in English,
that's about passion cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So really there's always stuff to learn.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're deep diving on that now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan, India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have old cannabis music.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then Sam, what's the oldest?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the oldest reference of music that
you have found that has cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I don't know the true history
and dates of a lot of this music.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, a lot of it I can't understand
because it's in Hindi or a different
[SPEAKER_03]: language.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I, I, I did turn, uh,
uh, Caleb onto, uh, the, uh, Greek stuff I
[SPEAKER_03]: was familiar with, which is some of it's
pretty old.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Rebetiko, Rebetiko.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a huge collection of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some of those tunes as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, uh, I downloaded a bunch of them for
this high T event because I felt like it
[SPEAKER_09]: was very fitting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, it's trippy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rebetiko, Hashishian music.
[SPEAKER_11]: The high T event was a perfect place for
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Music to be playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't understand that Greece used
to be the major exporter of Hashish in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, long, long before, uh, I mean,
they were making hash in linen bags like
[SPEAKER_03]: Lebanon does today.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like a hundred years ago or longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Linen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's, uh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use your head and you can come up with
some pretty good ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a video in Afghanistan the other day
where they were doing the linen and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: just the sea, but it was a real nice one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had broken up weed on top and it was
just raining dry sift down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually had a nice looking color,
even though it's always done in the
[SPEAKER_05]: darkest dingiest kind of basement without
window room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some great videos on YouTube of
traditional hash making in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you search for it, I think Charisi is
one of them that has just the pressing,
[SPEAKER_05]: the heating, the whole process from like
harvesting all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very, very traditional and
authentic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely fascinating how,
you know, cannabis was made, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: oppressed in various different cultures.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hit it in song, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: In, in, in Egypt, they, they even changed
the name of hashish, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that, you know, when the, uh,
Napoleonic people were trying to make it
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's fascinating how we still find ways
to hide it in plain sight, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That we, we did, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw, you know, it really emerged
sociologically through song, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Cypress Hill was a really big push
in the hip hop community that really broke
[SPEAKER_07]: that door open, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the high times where they had the
showing how to roll a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that was culturally huge in the
sense in that those ripples then felt
[SPEAKER_07]: safer for other musicians to, well,
if they can do it, then maybe I can cause
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, um, um, they go out on stage and
smoke and have smoked on stage every
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking show since the beginning,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, be real and they would have
none, nothing but keep it real,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also open that door so others can do
the same, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to remember that the Egyptians
were pulling the feet out of hashish
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers because they weren't smoking it
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were eating it and they would pull
your teeth out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they would do is give you rotten
milk to drink, make you throw up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it came up green, they pulled your
teeth out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and those guys kept eating hash
proving that even 400 years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, prohibition didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They destroyed the garden of Kapur,
which was a center of hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: We celebrated the garden of Kapur at one
of the legends of hashish years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the card in one of these,
uh, absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: The garden of Kapur.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking for the garden of Kapur.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then instead I think I found like a,
a Simpson sticker of big Buddha eating a
[SPEAKER_05]: burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shit you find man, the shit you find.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all around me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty excited for this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say, it seems like things are
picking up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, the further away we get away from
that whole COVID disaster is, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel every year that we get past that is
just like another better year and feel
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started the year off, uh, by jumping in
the Pacific ocean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you, but I did it with my
whole community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was probably 200 of us or a hundred
of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many of us, it's a small
community here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only about 1100 people that live
in my little village.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that I live in a village.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in the village of lions Bay,
the small seaside shanty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just across from Bowen Island Davis,
just across from Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lions Bay is definitely a really special
spot for sure.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been going there since I was like
pretty young.
[SPEAKER_19]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Amazing out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's something really distinct about
like the small communities around in BC.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really, uh, the people are really
pleasant.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's really that sense of community
too, that I really like, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe don't necessarily get as much these
days in smaller towns.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of becoming more decentralized
the way like people do things,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I, I can't speak for lions Bay,
but I feel over here, there's still a lot
[SPEAKER_19]: of that, which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have your hall, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Your town hall that everyone goes to for
parties and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you go to those parties in a
place like salt spring Island or Bowen
[SPEAKER_05]: Island, or even lions Bay, you'll see
people of all ages at those parties from
[SPEAKER_05]: like three years old up to like 85 or 90
years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our elder was 103 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just passed away last year of Bernice,
but yeah, it was just kind of like you get
[SPEAKER_05]: together with your community.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have to like, there's
definitely a price you pay when you
[SPEAKER_05]: isolate yourself towards like people that
are only like like-minded people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a total value.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's why I love hash church so
much of having your community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of your tribe who vibrate at your
frequency, but there's also a real value
[SPEAKER_05]: in hanging out with people who are in your
community, regardless of their frequency
[SPEAKER_05]: and learning things that you would
otherwise completely not be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a real appreciation for that small
village mentality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we raised our kids here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in a, not in a big city.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's all that diversity.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like what's really interesting over here
is that whether it's a politics or just
[SPEAKER_19]: individual, let's say like ideology,
there's a really diverse set.
[SPEAKER_19]: And for me, at least I found it was really
fortunate to grow up with people who had
[SPEAKER_19]: very different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe I don't necessarily agree with
everything they say, but I can see the
[SPEAKER_19]: logic and points and arguments that they
have that maybe I disagree with,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I see where their logic's coming from.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel that these days, you know,
you kind of tend to stay more in your
[SPEAKER_19]: group.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when there's that, you don't
really necessarily open up to the ideas
[SPEAKER_19]: that aren't yours or aren't what people
around you would have.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think also it was pretty unique here is
that it's such a diverse set of what
[SPEAKER_19]: people's professions are.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of construction here,
but I mean, there's a lot of artists.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I came from a family of artists
and a lot of people around me are.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on top of that too, I mean,
we have researchers like Wade Davis who
[SPEAKER_19]: live on Bowen Island.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's pretty mind blowing and people
aren't aware of his work.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's done a lot of work on psychoactive
drug research, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_19]: fascinating, ranging from all different
continents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Wade's amazing for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a real value in that
maintaining access to people that don't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily think like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what happens when you hang out
with people in a village like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you become less polarized and you all tend
to live metaphorically kind of in the body
[SPEAKER_05]: of the bird when it comes to your belief
systems, you're mostly in agreeance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only in the isolation when you
isolate yourself into these particular
[SPEAKER_05]: groups and really isolate that you get
pushed further and further into the
[SPEAKER_05]: extreme left or the extreme right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like those wings can't fly
without the bird.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of those wings can't fly without
the other wing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like the bird needs to be whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to say to what Caleb's been
talking about about the history of music
[SPEAKER_19]: and its connection with cannabis,
like American culture in terms of the
[SPEAKER_19]: development from like jazz in the 20s to
then blues to then rock all the way up to
[SPEAKER_19]: hip hop and the current age.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, it's amazing how many references and
how entangled, I guess I'd say,
[SPEAKER_19]: both are.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, like the jazz community would not
be what it was.
[SPEAKER_19]: Through the 20s to the 60s, if it wasn't
for the connections that had to the
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis industry, even all the way back
then.
[SPEAKER_19]: And same, I'd say the same would apply to
blues and rock as well and hip hop.
[SPEAKER_19]: And glass blowing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's connections.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's something about it that just lifts
your soul.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just get I, you know, when I was a
kid, it's almost like I had like two left
[SPEAKER_13]: feet.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did dance.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I did all that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I started smoking weed,
I could dance.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could feel rhythm like music was like.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just another level that like I
just wish like I wasn't shamed on as a kid
[SPEAKER_13]: for for like wanting to smoke weed because
there was something where where like not
[SPEAKER_13]: only was dance and rhythm so much more
easier, but math was easier.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, oh, I can I can do math really
quick in my head now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what it is, but but there's
something about making music while you're
[SPEAKER_13]: high and you're just on this level and
you're and especially like you're saying
[SPEAKER_13]: Davis, the jazz, like everybody is playing
a different instrument, but they're all on
[SPEAKER_13]: the same vibration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like and weed is like it and it
happens with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you can be like we are now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all high and we're all having a
really deep, you know, in depth
[SPEAKER_13]: conversation where we're on the vibration.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy that weed has influenced their
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, that's that's just talking
about jazz.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, who knows what the tribal music
drum circles were like when everybody was
[SPEAKER_13]: high.
[SPEAKER_13]: That must have been lit.
[SPEAKER_13]: They must have had so much fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's also not just the names in
music now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the names of bands have gone
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which has been a significant shift,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it's one thing to hide that right
within a song.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another thing to really out yourself
in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: I travel with another band out of San
Francisco called Total Devastation,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they were totally about cannabis from
the top to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the reactions we got when
we were in New Mexico versus Arizona early
[SPEAKER_07]: on, I mean, people were like, what the
flying fuck are you guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare you come to Texas and talk about
marijuana, you know, and be not not even
[SPEAKER_07]: white and saying that sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really challenging, Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's going to piggyback on what Laura
said, like Etienne and I are both
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work that I do is with
athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were talking about your
jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's funny that we want our
musicians to be high, but then we ridicule
[SPEAKER_00]: our athletes for being high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like that performance that
you were just talking about that flow
[SPEAKER_00]: state, which is like the focus of my whole
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow state does go back to indigenous
cultures across every continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, drum circles and different
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's funny that we do want our
artists like if there's an artist who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, smokes and they didn't smoke
before that performance, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, oh, man, this isn't this isn't
going to be as good as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you find out that your best
athlete, you know, broke some record and
[SPEAKER_00]: they had cannabis in their system,
they were just like, that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: penalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all performance.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good way of putting it,
the flow state in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And how it really does help achieve the
flow state, even in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: In my martial arts, if I'm if I'm on a
vibe and not only on weed, too,
[SPEAKER_13]: sometimes mushrooms, you know,
sometimes a little acid.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, I'm real about it, but not a
lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, but there's a point where it's
just like I achieve this flow state,
[SPEAKER_13]: like the music's going.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just going with your partner like
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_13]: Matters in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're just like, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It feels really good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it feels good to see that with
instruments, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Laura, did you feel that, you know,
when you were also, you know, doing your,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, your your martial arts,
that it helped center you, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: because when I was a kid, I remember,
you know, when I would go for my
[SPEAKER_07]: taekwondo, we would sit and we'd have to
center ourselves and get ourselves there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have the hardest time doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I smoked a little bit of pot,
I was there and ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you find that preparation?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I I I like doing both.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I like doing it just through
breathing and and and like finding
[SPEAKER_13]: self-acceptance and like accepting myself,
accepting my choices, like loving myself,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, like trying it through the yogi
style to like breathing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But every now and then, like I find myself
more of the not because I have to check
[SPEAKER_13]: out through a busy day.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to switch hats.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like I have to take a production hat
off and put martial arts hat on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And weed helps achieve that flow state and
helps me get into that moment and like
[SPEAKER_13]: really just have a good time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like like and that's what I love,
because it you know, I like you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: I like laughing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I spend a lot of my time laughing and I I
like having a good time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes, especially after a long,
hard day as we all have like that that
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis and like you said, Etienne,
just getting into that state and just like
[SPEAKER_13]: X and and being like just one with
yourself and one with your partner and
[SPEAKER_13]: just kind of not having to think about
anything else outside of just like what
[SPEAKER_13]: you guys are doing, like dancing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like it's very much like dancing,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it gets you kind of in the mood for
dancing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it on my snowboard when I'm ripping
down the backside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got like Metallica disposable
heroes blaring in my ears.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably going around 80 kilometers an
hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm saying that superhero stuff right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is my job because people now know
like music can put you in this heightened
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're you have cannabis in
your system, you're in this flow state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're almost in this balance of like
the energy of the music is like surging
[SPEAKER_00]: through me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel my body, but I'm also very calm
and focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see everything right before it
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what all of us are
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when people think everybody's getting
blitzed, a lot of us are so stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does bring us to that like very
natural flow state of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told somebody the best way I can explain
mushrooms to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you bought like a million dollar
hat and you walked outside and a bird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your natural reaction is to freak out and
panic, but you consume mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy a million dollar hat and walk
outside and you go, why would I spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars on a hat?
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally changes your perspective and
it buffers that rage and it gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: second to process.
[SPEAKER_05]: That perspective is so important because
first my heart broke when Bell said I wish
[SPEAKER_05]: I hadn't been shamed for my cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I thought on the flip side of
that, a that's terrible shame on them,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's not the shame that brings us
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how we react to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our perspective that can either
destroy us or it can build us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for any people out there that are
feeling shame in regards to their cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: use or really anything, just realize that
you don't have to let it set in,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the way it can and does
sometimes depending on your perspective
[SPEAKER_05]: and how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to let it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Simpsons that was done recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Marge and Lisa and Marge says
something to Lisa and she means it with
[SPEAKER_05]: love, but it's really like terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember what it was, but the word
in big thick font goes into Lisa's ear and
[SPEAKER_05]: it just like settles into her being.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's such a heavy episode of this mom
daughter energy of the mom, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: unwittingly destroying the daughter with
these with these words, not realizing that
[SPEAKER_05]: that that she's taking them the way she
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're kids, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just take it the way we take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that becomes our trauma.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as adults, you can take it
differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is really truly a martial arts of
its own.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see how people would, you know,
it's a it's a it's a fear of like,
[SPEAKER_13]: will they have self control?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I do have friends that,
you know, they don't do anything,
[SPEAKER_13]: man.
[SPEAKER_13]: They play video games all day and just
smoke all day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And and I mean, if that brings them peace
and happiness, then by all means,
[SPEAKER_13]: do you.
[SPEAKER_13]: But like something tells me their
trajectory isn't the most healthy
[SPEAKER_13]: trajectory sometimes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can see how like a parent would
fear.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't want their kids to they
definitely want us to practice self
[SPEAKER_13]: control.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's a stigma of like, you know,
not letting teenagers smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I kind of really wish because like I
really wish like they weren't so hard on
[SPEAKER_13]: teen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we weren't so hard on teenagers
being able to access cannabis,
[SPEAKER_13]: because if I were to able if I were to to
have that access as a teenager,
[SPEAKER_13]: I I'm pretty sure I probably would have
done a lot better because there is
[SPEAKER_13]: something when I just started smoking
weed, like my mathematics, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: my my writing skills, like everything just
skyrocketed, like everything just clicked.
[SPEAKER_13]: But not I mean, it's not that it was hard
for me necessarily, but it's just like,
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like it would have just helped me a
lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that coming from a dad with a
teen age, or I feel like if they start to
[SPEAKER_09]: too young, you know, it'll fuck them up in
school.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're they're they're focused isn't
where it should be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know, I try to find that
balance still right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, so I think that's the art right
of finding that balance.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, and a lot of the parents
here and here in the animal triangle do
[SPEAKER_13]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a friend, you know, we were driving
her kid to school.
[SPEAKER_13]: He took a huge bong rip, put his bong back
in his cushion bong bag and got out,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, while he was still blowing up
the smoke.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, dude, you are the luckiest
fucking kid in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just like rip mad bong rip and then
put your bong back in.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, but this kid has self
control.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this kid now he built a cabin.
[SPEAKER_13]: He built his own cabin.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a contractor.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you finding that my kids doing
right now, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going home, you know, he just needed
a little extra.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of difference in kids,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of them, cannabis can be such
a reward to them that it's hard for them
[SPEAKER_03]: to want to seek other things to find
reward, like hard work or doing math or
[SPEAKER_03]: doing physical exercise, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the trouble is cannabis is just too
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my favorite thing, you know,
me and my business do a ton of work with
[SPEAKER_00]: athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to tell athletes like it's
not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis is helping you balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're consuming so that you can help
balance your own system that's essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: dysregulated or dysfunctional as veterans
always have to tell people nobody wakes up
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, I want to throw my life away or
do a bad drug, but people do wake up
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for relief in different kinds of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we acknowledge children
also feel trauma and they do feel relief,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't educate them on the right
pathways, that's how you end up consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's maybe more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, I think there is balance
because if there's a kid at your school
[SPEAKER_00]: that has epilepsy and he's got a medical
permit to consume cannabis, you can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: the parent that just says cannabis is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different forms and ways and
reasons that people consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why education is so important
because the kids know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they listen to the music,
they know all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, balance for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a 1.8 GPA coming out of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started consuming cannabis after the
Marines and I got Ivy League offers to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a PhD and I couldn't, the stress levels I
had growing up on the South side of
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicago, I couldn't focus on school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started consuming cannabis as an
adult, like Laura said, school became like
[SPEAKER_00]: a video game almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, if I focus on it,
I bet you I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I stunk like weed all the way through
high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like total potentiator of my
stereotype, selling weed to everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It allowed me to meet every group,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was guys who were like metal
heads that smoked weed while I was friends
[SPEAKER_05]: with those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were like sporto guys that played
like football or basketball.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could sell weed to those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just every group in the school,
but they all had something in common.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all had weed smokers in each of their
groups, which kind of gave a nice in to
[SPEAKER_05]: that group.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, my goodness, did I potentiate
that stereotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving an orange Volkswagen van,
74 Westphalia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd park it in the teacher's parking lot
because it was right where the kids all
[SPEAKER_05]: came out of this long, concrete pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would sit in the back with my little
90 degree window open and I would,
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a stove with like blades on the
stove and I would sell hash hits for like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if it was two for five or
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot knives at school in the teacher's
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good heat score.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super heat score.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was low key.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one was like taking anything with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when they walked away from the van,
they just exhaled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot, hot knives too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oof.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glowies, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not quite glowies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always like to let it not glow,
but I bet you it was still like 850 to 900
[SPEAKER_05]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, I'm sorry to all of you who paid
for that actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonkers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonkers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Steven, I wanted to comment on,
you know, you must have a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: experience of athletes having,
you know, athletes and the cannabis world
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of coming together.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we were talking about how it's
like, we expect our music artists to,
[SPEAKER_13]: to, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they get a pass for being all high
because it makes good music, but it's not
[SPEAKER_13]: okay for an athlete who's in a lot of pain
to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll get kicked out of the UFC or no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you'll get kicked off of the
football team.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I found that like, you know,
I hope that can change for, for our
[SPEAKER_13]: society.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just curious to see like what,
you know, the athletes that are curious to
[SPEAKER_13]: hear like the athletes that you work with
and like how they go about advocating for
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis usage for other athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my consulting company has each
consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a bunch of work with Ricky Williams
and other pro athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People kind of know those stories,
but now we're trying to get like deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into those stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realize where it's, it's 75% of some of
these pro sports leagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard somebody recently say in the NBA,
they have a second bus on the team drives
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the guys who smoke weed because
that's how many people on one team
[SPEAKER_00]: actually consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people's eyebrows will raise
until you've had the experience of pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relief from cannabis until you've had the
experience of, I wasn't sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis helped me sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why these people who are on the road,
their whole lives, the most athletic
[SPEAKER_00]: people we've ever seen whose bodies are
breaking down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very low range of how they,
uh, we say your best asset is your
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hurting, not available,
your assets drop exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis keeps most of them going
secretly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has for decades and decades and
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like bubble man said, they've been friends
with the same people who are artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been friends with the people who
sell in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people who sold weed said
their best clients were athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like, this is something
that's always been known.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can stop like hiding when I hear
guys in NFL say 85% of their team smokes
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, at this point we might as well
actually talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it is something that they
are advocating for, but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize there's organizational structures
that those millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars you make like Ricky Williams was
such a visionary because he did walk away
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top of the game, unreal,
leaving millions behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what makes him a visionary to
this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ricky is unbelievable, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the talk about putting your,
uh, your money where your mouth is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave up on the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, why'd you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, so I could hack so I could have
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, damn dude, that is like one of
the most powerful statements.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me that in Barcelona many,
many years ago, he walked by my booth and
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know him at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know football actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony V was next to me and he was all
starstruck because he was big football
[SPEAKER_05]: fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea who the dude was,
but I was like, that dude was prolific.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I got the best Ricky Williams
story.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is back when he was still playing
for Miami.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at Berkeley patients group.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my employees comes in and he was
running up the stairs and he is
[SPEAKER_07]: hyperventilating.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name's Dr. Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually a doctor now and he is just
hyperventilating because as you can see,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been a New Orleans Saint fan all my
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from New Orleans, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I followed Ricky's whole path from when
he was drafted.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my guy he can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't make it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually he says, Ricky Williams
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, no, look outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go and I look outside because we're
in a second story window and I see a
[SPEAKER_07]: orange flaked Hummer one with Florida
plates.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh shit, he's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I casually go downstairs and I see him
and he's registering.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, all right, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ricky Williams.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually still playing in the NFL at
this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and he's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go around and this is back when we had
before we got evicted from the federal
[SPEAKER_07]: government.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had onsite consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only did we have onsite
consumption, we had comedy and various
[SPEAKER_07]: other live events.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had a female comedian randomly that
particular day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a Friday and Ricky, he registers
and he comes in and he sits down in a
[SPEAKER_07]: table next to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm just kind of casually just
smoking a joint that I had rolled and I
[SPEAKER_07]: had gotten some weed and I was actually
rolling a joint because I was gonna ask
[SPEAKER_07]: him to smoke a joint, which he did.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was always doing it casually and
watching him.
[SPEAKER_07]: This comedian on stage is like,
so has anybody ever been to Texas?
[SPEAKER_07]: And nobody raises a hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he kind of raises his hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, all right, has anybody
ever been to the university in Texas?
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, that's where we went to
school.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he raises his hand and she goes,
well, who the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ricky Williams.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the entire room just stopped and
turned around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause he had just shaved his head.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was very clean shaven, but he still had
the beard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could recognize who he was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the comedian is just like,
oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, welcome Ricky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, nobody's facing her at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when I took the moment and I
kind of went over to her and was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: hey, Ricky, I know you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started my tattoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, followed your career your whole
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I smoke a joint with you and just
shoot the shit?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my establishment.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was the most down to earth
recognized guy called my friend,
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff Jones.
[SPEAKER_07]: He rushed over with a vaporizer to give
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause he's like, he should have a
healthier version.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he gave him a volcano vaporizer and we
sent him on his way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was my Ricky Williams story,
which is absolutely hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I felt bad for the poor
comedian.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she's just trying to do her
thing and she's got a joke and she
[SPEAKER_07]: unfortunately never was able to recover
from it, but it was just one of those epic
[SPEAKER_07]: moments.
[SPEAKER_07]: So ask Steven, if you see him next time,
ask him, he remembers that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Rick is very down to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always made himself very accessible
to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually met Rick on a gongy air
call where we were, I was there as a
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome Institute, like, um, person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there as a gongy air person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were there with a bunch of people
just talking about the quality of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was explaining how athletes are
some of the best people as an audience to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain quality to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell the whole country right now
about the difference between craft and
[SPEAKER_00]: mass produced cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell an athlete the difference between
something like supplements or Gatorade,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you tell them anything they put in
their body and you tell them, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is premium and this is unleaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh, I only want the premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick has been a huge person,
like to just talk about those different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and the difference in product
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the athletes listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of if these companies actually
figured it out, all the NBA, all the NFL,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: These massive multi-billion dollar teams.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be like the dream job too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, Oh, I'm the grower for the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: As city chiefs, I grow all the flower that
all of those players use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm the extract maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I make the hash for, and they have a state
of the art facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all like, there's agronomists.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these scientists that work and
collect data.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like developing cultivars for
specific athletes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has money to burn?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like those companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you imagine the grows and the hash
making facilities that would exist in an
[SPEAKER_05]: NBA or a, or a, or an NBA?
[SPEAKER_05]: NFL football team.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that team would, that team would
chief down, wouldn't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: They would.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I picked the chiefs,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was a no pun intended sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we change them to the Keef's?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can say what you were saying about the
athletes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And back when I worked at the galaxy
gallery, the head shop in the nineties in,
[SPEAKER_07]: in Los Angeles, the Portland trailblazers
came in, bought our rack of bongs and
[SPEAKER_07]: pipes, all the down stems, all the rubber
pieces, cleaning equipment, and the team
[SPEAKER_07]: equipment guys, the guy who came in and
picked it all up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually traveled with the actual
basketball and all of their training
[SPEAKER_07]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been part, I mean, trust me,
we were all, we were all like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, you never saw us here, you know,
sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is way back in, like I said,
90, you know, 97, 98.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was really mind blowing to me to
see how not only integrated it was within
[SPEAKER_07]: the system, this system adapted,
modified itself illegally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I know the commissioner and all them
were like, we never saw this sort of shit,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it still went on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how does, I mean, the NBA is relaxed as
policies, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the, the NFL is in the midst of going
through that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's taken the NFL so long?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause the NBA and the others have seen the
direct effects cannabis has had positively
[SPEAKER_07]: on their athletes, especially because of
the, you know, the more games and rushing
[SPEAKER_07]: them, the Thursday night games and things
like that, that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: really forcing quick recovery that was
unheard of back in, you know, the eighties
[SPEAKER_07]: and nineties, but now they're forced to
live.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they negotiate that reality versus,
you know, that corporate reality versus
[SPEAKER_07]: taking care of their bodies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they see them as assets,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your team is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your best player is available,
if your players constantly getting hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: every year and you're like, we fired
everybody, we changed players.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's something, if there was this one
tool that could keep our players healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can make a bunch of money off
of our players, if there was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that could, with concussions and pain,
and it's just like, they've been secretly
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to tell you that they already found
something that works for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but your policy is why so many of them
either secretly use it or avoid it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want to deny CTE even exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the mentality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when Etienne was wondering,
I wonder why the NFL hasn't figured this
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I think it has to do with their
close intimate relationship with Satan.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, I think the market, I think there
could be, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And like three or four years ago,
when the NFL first mentioned that they
[SPEAKER_18]: were going to spend a billion dollars in
research on medical issues that impact
[SPEAKER_18]: football players, their first emphasis was
not on CTE at all.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was right after the movie
Concussion came out, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Where if you're a football player or if
you played football or you're a fan,
[SPEAKER_18]: football fan, watch the movie Concussion
when Will Smith, yeah, that's slapping the
[SPEAKER_18]: face Will Smith.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he's a douche for that,
but anyway, make a long story short,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's a really good movie.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't believe you'll ever watch a
football game in the same way again,
[SPEAKER_18]: after watching that movie.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you look at the way the NFL spent
their dollars, so their first projects
[SPEAKER_18]: that they funded in academia to look at
health related issues had nothing to do
[SPEAKER_18]: with CTE.
[SPEAKER_18]: It had to do strictly with pain.
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we deal with pain so we can shoot
the players with something on the sideline
[SPEAKER_18]: and send those multimillion dollar people
back out onto the field to generate
[SPEAKER_18]: billions of dollars for these corporates
that are basically got their fingers in
[SPEAKER_18]: the pie.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just like Deep Throat said, follow the
money.
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason why this hasn't been brought to
the forefront is because the right amount
[SPEAKER_18]: of Ben Franklin's have not exchanged
hands.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all having to do with money.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because now if you look at their
portfolio, and I think ATN, I think you
[SPEAKER_18]: had mentioned this previously on an
episode of Hash Church, and I think,
[SPEAKER_18]: did we have the Canadian researcher on?
[SPEAKER_18]: I've met her, but I know- Her name is Liz,
Liz Thompson.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know they're now shifting their
portfolio to focus on CTE.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think they're recognizing that,
yes, the human brain inside the skull,
[SPEAKER_18]: inside a football helmet was never meant
to handle this level of trauma.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you play football from your peewee
years, completely through high school,
[SPEAKER_18]: completely through college, complete,
you've experienced a lifetime of brain
[SPEAKER_18]: trauma.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's amazing it's not more prevalent,
Stephen, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: If you think about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other thing I guess is that think
about the football NFL's business model.
[SPEAKER_18]: When those players are being paid millions
of dollars and they're on that field,
[SPEAKER_18]: they're generating advertising revenues
for all of the sponsors and all the- When
[SPEAKER_18]: they're retired, the NFL could give a shit
about them, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are the people who come down
with CTE after they leave the game.
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's certainly players who leave
the game either on their own accord,
[SPEAKER_18]: like Ricky and other people, but there's
also people who end up leaving the game
[SPEAKER_18]: not realizing they have CTE and then later
on end up killing themselves like Junior
[SPEAKER_18]: Seau, who shot himself in the gut knowing
that they can study his brain.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the whole notion is that,
yes, we need to come up with ways of
[SPEAKER_18]: intervening the thing that leads to
chronic conditions like CTE in players
[SPEAKER_18]: after they retire from the game.
[SPEAKER_18]: After they retire from the game,
they're no longer generating revenue for
[SPEAKER_18]: the sponsor.
[SPEAKER_18]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_18]: Just shoot some drones full of pain
medicine, send them back out onto the
[SPEAKER_18]: field, get revenue from advertising
dollars up.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all having to do with money,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think, again, I'll just say this is
that it looks like the NFL has recognized
[SPEAKER_18]: that CTE is an issue because now they're
funding research not just on pain,
[SPEAKER_18]: but they're funding research on
concussion.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we all know from- And ATM,
we've talked about this before,
[SPEAKER_18]: that cannabinoids reduce
neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the golden hour of trauma,
which is right after a concussion occurs,
[SPEAKER_18]: they need a shot of cannabinoids into
their brains to reduce neuroinflammation
[SPEAKER_18]: because often what happens is that it's
the neuroinflammation and the fact that
[SPEAKER_18]: the cranium basically keeps the brain in
place.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no place for it to expand.
[SPEAKER_18]: You often get hemorrhaging and you often
have incidents that happen later on.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the other thing that I would
just say is that it's not just smoking
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there could be other ways that
they can use the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's so much research that's being
done on how to deliver compounds across
[SPEAKER_18]: the blood-brain barrier, how to use not
just phyto-cannabinoids, but the other
[SPEAKER_18]: synthetic cannabinoids like the wind
compound and the other endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_18]: and things that act on the endocannabinoid
system to try to figure this all out.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying that CTE and concussion can
be treated with cannabinoids, but right
[SPEAKER_18]: now we don't really know because the
plant's been demonized or hasn't been a
[SPEAKER_18]: whole lot of research.
[SPEAKER_18]: But now there's a lot of things to believe
that if we could administer cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_18]: right after, so on the sideline,
these guys should be getting nasal spray
[SPEAKER_18]: of cannabinoids goes right into the brain
because that's the quickest way into the
[SPEAKER_18]: brain is through the nose.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not smoking, not vaping, not taking a
pill.
[SPEAKER_18]: This isn't something in a magic pill.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that a transnasal
formulation right into the brain can
[SPEAKER_18]: basically help reduce neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_18]: And ATN, this could be used in the theater
to treat head injury, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: In military... There already are.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, so there's so many different
things that they ought to do that would
[SPEAKER_18]: actually be kind of like the way
everyone's like, well, why did we pay NASA
[SPEAKER_18]: to put people on the moon?
[SPEAKER_18]: It was all the technical technology that
was developed around the moon landing that
[SPEAKER_18]: benefited society.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is something that... All the
technology they lost?
[SPEAKER_18]: NFL should pay for because it's directly
affecting the people who are generating
[SPEAKER_18]: the money every Sunday when people tune in
and watch NFL football games.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's probably a fair number of those
people who are playing in that game who
[SPEAKER_18]: are going to suffer from CTE later on in
life.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that cannabinoids could be
part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_18]: Stephen, I actually reached out to you by
text.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's exactly what I want to talk to you
about.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's reconnect after this episode if
we could.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the realities of... I'm actually
trying to bridge the State Department,
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to actually get that name of that
nasal medication that is in the military
[SPEAKER_07]: packs currently in Germany and Israel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you can hit them within that
golden hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Moshulam found this back in the 60s
that if you were... Well, he said they
[SPEAKER_07]: smoked a joint within that golden hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can stop that brain swelling.
[SPEAKER_07]: from happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm rather surprised, Stephen,
that the NFL wouldn't be interested in
[SPEAKER_07]: something that could help prolong,
especially the teams.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying every type of recovery
method.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw they had no hand coolers that go
over the wrists to cool down the athletes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rather surprising they won't look at
protecting them that they know how serious
[SPEAKER_07]: CTE is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find it hard that the money... There's
got to be some sort of weird twisted
[SPEAKER_07]: effort to keep it from... I don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just marketing dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was some Dr. Evil on the moon
rubbing his little grubby hands together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is marketing dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NFL only makes money if we watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teams that make the most money sell
the most tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all about attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they can get your viewing dollars,
then they also can slip in and ask for
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can say, hey, we have the most
viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anheuser-Busch gets an advertising spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay a ton of money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Anheuser-Busch is their lead marketer,
they're not going to do something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: directly competitive that they know
Anheuser-Busch is probably on the back end
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to find its way into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like when you get behind closed
doors, this is when you find out like GTI
[SPEAKER_00]: just signed a deal with Barstool Sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you find out Cookie signed a deal
with USC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called a CBD and wellness deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marketing dollars are actually finally
meeting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is there's no education or
guidance into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going for the biggest players in
the industry, the biggest names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know who built the industry and
they're like, why aren't we making any
[SPEAKER_00]: money?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the education athletes is
huge right now because they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just sell Gatorade if there's a better
alternative to Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to sell some bad
supplement if there's a better alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: to supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like cannabis is the first time
athletes can say for themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what helps me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flower helped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hash helped me through my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're still up against big marketing
and that's why you can't get a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Superbowl commercial even if it's about
sick kids or veterans because people have
[SPEAKER_00]: applied for the last three years and those
commercials have been denied.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are any of these organizations thinking
about cannabis in terms of the mental
[SPEAKER_12]: health of their athletes or their anxiety
or performance anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you can't say that on the
forefront as long as it's so WADA
[SPEAKER_00]: regulates the globe's doping
recommendations and rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: WADA follows the DEA scheduling of a no
medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates a gridlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me as a researcher,
like what's the way through and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, there's a gridlock as long as it's
the DEA says no medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The World Anti-Doping Agency says no
medical use and the sports agencies have
[SPEAKER_00]: to follow WADA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Sha'Carri Richardson technically
didn't violate any rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't even violate, you know,
as far as like the NCAA would be now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She violated WADA, which is the World
Anti-Doping Agency and everybody has to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, with the change in the scheduling,
I ultimately think that there will be a
[SPEAKER_19]: change in the perception that people have
on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like really what it comes down to is like,
it's a combination of changes with an
[SPEAKER_19]: understanding coming from the government
end.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on the other hand, like private
industry that has enough capital to really
[SPEAKER_19]: push it forward.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reality is there hasn't been that
yet on either side.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, like to give a few examples up
here in Canada, like the majority of
[SPEAKER_19]: politicians don't understand any of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I'm in communication with the
co-chair of the cannabis caucus for the
[SPEAKER_19]: federal liberals.
[SPEAKER_19]: I also have a contact with the
conservative party as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm mind blown like how little
information is there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not like I expect them to be experts,
just like I don't expect them to know
[SPEAKER_19]: everything about like alcohol or alcohol
production, for example, but there isn't
[SPEAKER_19]: really even the base, you know,
basics that are there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so like the thing that's happening in
the States is when there's like a change
[SPEAKER_19]: in terms of the scheduling, as long as the
right information is getting through and
[SPEAKER_19]: as strange as this is to say, but like
corporations that maybe have malintention
[SPEAKER_19]: but at the same time, at least they're
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really have an optimistic stance that
we're going to see changes like that
[SPEAKER_19]: because I mean, up here in Canada,
I know a lot of athletes or ex-athletes
[SPEAKER_19]: who use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I know one guy that was in the
WHL, one guy that was in the WFL that grew
[SPEAKER_19]: up in North Vancouver, pretty close to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: And both of them use lots of cannabis,
but ultimately even with legalization,
[SPEAKER_19]: they're not, this is the other side of it
too, is there's still that kind of
[SPEAKER_19]: discriminatory type stance on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not really comfortable going
around being the endorser of cannabis or
[SPEAKER_19]: having their name attached to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like sure they use it, it's a part of
their lives.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really important to them,
but they feel they'll be maybe
[SPEAKER_19]: stigmatized, maybe discriminated against,
maybe not taken as seriously because of
[SPEAKER_19]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, like someone like myself,
I was fortunate I never really had that
[SPEAKER_19]: kind of circumstance.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been a medical patient since I was
young.
[SPEAKER_19]: I never had people like, I went to high
school in West Vancouver for those who
[SPEAKER_19]: don't know, it's one of the wealthiest
areas in Canada.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of, let's say more like
conservative or anti-drug type mentalities
[SPEAKER_19]: from people there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I never found that when I communicated it
or when I explained my use or explained
[SPEAKER_19]: things about cannabis that they're unaware
of, but it doesn't change the fact that
[SPEAKER_19]: until there's those changes that are
created, it's kind of going to be the
[SPEAKER_19]: stalemate of just waiting until something
happens realistically.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, indeed, indeed.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just going to show this product.
[SPEAKER_18]: I picked up this product at a cannabis
show a couple of years ago and it's a CBD
[SPEAKER_18]: transnasal mist.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know, it's probably,
I don't think it's a nano emulsion,
[SPEAKER_18]: but you'd imagine that just something like
this, you know, just given a couple of
[SPEAKER_18]: shots up the nose after concussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nano emulsion isn't as effective as
exosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They load exosomes and that's what gives
the payload to the brain.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think that, so the research
really is, I mean, a lot of the pieces are
[SPEAKER_18]: out there.
[SPEAKER_18]: People have shown that they could deliver
drugs using these types of nano emulsions
[SPEAKER_18]: or other types of formulations.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the key thing is that can you
deliver it in a concentration that's
[SPEAKER_18]: effective?
[SPEAKER_18]: To reduce neuroinflammation, to create a
better outcome for the patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: The university of Miami has a patent on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost certain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They definitely have the knowledge on how
they were the ones that discovered using
[SPEAKER_05]: exosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my business partner, Dr. Brent
Reynolds, who I met through Tony and those
[SPEAKER_05]: guys and continued to work with him after
Jamaica that was working at the
[SPEAKER_05]: university.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were actually going to load up
psychedelics into the exosomes and deliver
[SPEAKER_05]: them right to the brain, but no,
we spoke about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a 45 times payload to the brain
that they had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: 45 times more.
[SPEAKER_18]: So why doesn't the NFL, I mean,
it seems like this is just an obvious low
[SPEAKER_18]: lying fruit for them to go after.
[SPEAKER_18]: Given the safety of cannabinoids,
you know, humans can tolerate
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be a thing that the NFL
wouldn't even have to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_05]: just the doctors that work for them would
have it in their bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, when it comes to sports,
marketing, Pfizer is like a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you ever watched sports, you'll see
Pfizer advertised, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pfizer is very much into the synthetic
cannabinoid field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent a couple billion dollars to
acquire arena pharmaceutical, arena
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, they specialize in
irritable bowel syndrome drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I don't know if you know,
but cannabis helps irritable bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome like pretty much most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are they cannabinoid like, or are they
completely synthetic or what are their
[SPEAKER_18]: active ingredients look like, Stephen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly because when the
merger went through, everything went
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet, but they let people know what the
intent was behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it tells me is if Pfizer,
as big a company as it is, spent billions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars to acquire a company that
specializes in cannabinoid development,
[SPEAKER_00]: the NFL on the back end, knowing that
Pfizer is one of their partners,
[SPEAKER_00]: these people all talk, it's corporate
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just moving money around the same
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that then lets me know the NFL is
funding cannabis and concussion research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pfizer is doing some stuff over here with
irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, to the people on this call,
like, I don't always want that to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the corporate model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think just like Kraft beer and just
like Kraft burgers, I think this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to push Kraft cannabis exactly where we
want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be so much mass produced,
big, just stuff on Walgreens shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you will get that other
person who I don't want to fit in a 50
[SPEAKER_00]: cent beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a dollar burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want is a dollar that maybe costs a
burger that costs 15 bucks, but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all locally raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where all the ingredients came from
and I know where the money goes back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't care about that type of
quality in food until we started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: educated as a public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, McDonald's burgers are not good for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to eat a burger,
maybe look towards these type of raised,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is how your beef was
raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis is about to go the same
way because of the model that these big
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations are taking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about having blinders on,
though, where it's like it takes you to
[SPEAKER_05]: gain 200 pounds before you realize,
I don't think this burger is good for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's changing me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, I don't know if you saw this
thing that was in the news this week,
[SPEAKER_18]: Marcus, but there was a statement made by
the Surgeon General in the United States
[SPEAKER_18]: that connects alcohol to increase risk of
certain kinds of cancers.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was in the news.
[SPEAKER_18]: Huge surprise.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most poisonous thing causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, so if this gets to the point where
they actually want to put warning and
[SPEAKER_18]: recommendation labels on like,
you know, the way they used to put things
[SPEAKER_18]: on cigarettes, that cigarettes cause
cancer, that, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_18]: consuming alcohol, even like one or two
drinks a day, they said.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, statistically increases your
risk for all these cancers and everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, my gosh, where are the labels on
anything containing high fructose corn
[SPEAKER_18]: syrup and diabetes?
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like, well, it's it's kind of
like, you know, cancer is a multi-billion
[SPEAKER_18]: dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: And just like Stephen said, you know,
you got companies like Pfizer and other
[SPEAKER_18]: huge multinational public corporations
that, again, are all about return to the
[SPEAKER_18]: shareholders.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're looking to make as much money
as they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've said it here on Hash Church
before.
[SPEAKER_18]: The mantra of the pharmaceutical companies
is not to cure disease.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's to hook customers for life and start
sucking on that insurance teat.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's another thing that was in the
news.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this guy was gunned down on the
streets of New York, a place I just
[SPEAKER_18]: visited last week.
[SPEAKER_18]: For what?
[SPEAKER_18]: For being the the the CEO of a huge
medical insurance thing called United,
[SPEAKER_18]: whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to say their name.
[SPEAKER_18]: But the point is, is that our health care
system, at least here in the states,
[SPEAKER_18]: is completely being sucked dry because
it's a for profit health care system where
[SPEAKER_18]: you have this insurance industry in
between the providers and the people who
[SPEAKER_18]: need health care.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're sucking all the money out and
determining who gets coverage and who
[SPEAKER_18]: doesn't, what things are covered and what
aren't covered.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah, man, there's such big money in
keeping people sick, keeping people sick.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like an industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an industry that makes money for
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you know, how do you fix that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Can cannabis help?
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely goes to show you that for
sure, evil exists, regardless of your
[SPEAKER_05]: religious or spiritual beliefs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to know that evil exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've said it before, it's got to be a
part of free will, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like without it, free will isn't free
will.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like when Elon Musk says that
censorship or free speech is only really
[SPEAKER_05]: free speech when someone says something
you don't like, because it's easy when
[SPEAKER_05]: people are saying the things that you do
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when they say things you don't like
that it becomes free speech that you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, people should be allowed to say what
they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're saying stupid, heinous
shit, well, most likely society will get
[SPEAKER_05]: on that and kind of, you know,
create boundaries around those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard to have free speech when
when you're censoring any side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I saw a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a political cartoonist.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had she had to resign from Washington
Post and tell nice because of a political
[SPEAKER_07]: cartoon she did of Jeff Bezos bowing and
giving money to fucking the Trump
[SPEAKER_07]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she got fired.
[SPEAKER_05]: And her job is to make social commentary
through cartoon jokes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except against except except against the
oligarchy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then then that's that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck censorship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd say so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's you know, that does have a very
sharp ended sword on the other side.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very much it can't put it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lack of censorship in that on that
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannot exist in a world where if you can
hurt someone's feelings, you've broken the
[SPEAKER_05]: law.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they will think that, you know,
people are getting an oligarchy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the oligarchy via Luigi found
that it's 1735 in France and we're not
[SPEAKER_07]: going to tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd rather have guillotines than live
with this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're talking about taking over
Canada and Greenland, for Christ sakes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, what world do we live in?
[SPEAKER_18]: Today?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we live in a world that has already
done exactly what you just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole world is a cut up board of
countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how that happened was all these
different groups took those countries and
[SPEAKER_05]: put up borders and said, this is ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they fought for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this has been happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at a map and it just doesn't
say Earth, but it has all these different
[SPEAKER_05]: countries names, then exactly what you
just said is exactly what's been happening
[SPEAKER_05]: since the beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are taking that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that Laura said earlier about
people being on the same page,
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the military and something in
sports that we notice is during times of
[SPEAKER_00]: trauma, people who are on the same page
hit these unified flow states,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when shit gets really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to see Steph Curry shooting
threes and you're like, yo, Steph Curry's
[SPEAKER_00]: in flow state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing to watch all his
teammates moving at the exact same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just like, how much training
did it take for you all's brains to
[SPEAKER_00]: synchronize on the road, hostile crowd,
people screaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all are pretty much like doing a
synchronized dance right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think we we've shown that our
bodies can do it with performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now one of the things I love
about being a researcher, every time
[SPEAKER_00]: civilization hit some crazy major breaking
point, researchers across the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: before Wi-Fi all came up with like similar
discoveries because they were going
[SPEAKER_00]: through similar types of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why hash church is so
important because you find out the more
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you reach out to, you're like,
you're doing something a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: than what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's trying to move their
little bit forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a unified flow state
that we're all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get to a certain point of trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could say this as a veteran where
you're just like, I'm not afraid of my
[SPEAKER_00]: fear anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not afraid of trauma,
like those different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Laura said earlier, is you
actually start building a self resiliency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I can actually move this
thing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody on this call is
moving their local, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: group forward as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when the whatever rescheduling
happens, it's going to benefit big ass
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here pretty much agrees on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like my work with athleticism,
the work with veterans, everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's doing on here, there's going
to be more opportunities to pop up one way
[SPEAKER_00]: or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going to be companies can't
benefit if there's no consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but consumers are also now investors and
business owners themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what makes this kind of domestic
circular economy so interesting right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want the masses, they want the
botanical turps with floor sweepings and
[SPEAKER_05]: distillate sprayed on them, and they can
have that market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the people in here are more
specialized in like, accessing a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's you know, as much of making
friends always told me, John made enough
[SPEAKER_05]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just focus on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And who wants that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I don't really want to sell floor
sweepings and distillate and botanical
[SPEAKER_05]: turps and pre rolled joints with thick
paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to do that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's millions of people who want to
smoke that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so who am I to say that they
shouldn't?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely going to do my best on the
other side of the market to try and like,
[SPEAKER_05]: send in little lures over to that side of
the camp to kind of like bring them over
[SPEAKER_05]: to a different sort of Hey, have you heard
of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, have you seen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you tried smoking just to hash off
the plant in a smaller amount from the
[SPEAKER_05]: health perspective, there's so many
different perspectives that people have
[SPEAKER_05]: today that they didn't necessarily have 25
to 30 years ago, and people are more
[SPEAKER_05]: cognitive of health.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, longevity and, you know,
being more safe in the things that you do
[SPEAKER_05]: on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that a lot of the aspects of
the market that we in this room seem to be
[SPEAKER_05]: focused on, feed into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's okay if it's not the yeah,
chimeras say no to floor sweeping,
[SPEAKER_05]: say yes to abundance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel that unfortunately, a lot of people
out there are focusing on the money and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, there's a sucker born every
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a sucker born every minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my goodness, be nicer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to like take people down,
like just go do something good with your
[SPEAKER_05]: life and put some sort of better frequency
into the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: The world can use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all frequency.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all putting these vibrations out
into the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's what the Indians called
karma, because that stuff comes around.
[SPEAKER_12]: The world could be such a better place if
everybody smoked the quality of hash that
[SPEAKER_12]: we were smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that too, Caitlin, I do feel that
then on the flip side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I feel like, oh my god,
I don't know if that's the case,
[SPEAKER_05]: even though I, I need it to be the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it to be the case.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's funny that Caitlin said that
because I was just about to say the same
[SPEAKER_13]: thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was about to be like, man, like I wish
this was, I wish hash was available in
[SPEAKER_13]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Southeast Asia, places in Southeast
Asia where they could really use it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of drinking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Japanese people love to, man, they love to
drink.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can drink.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think they could really use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And not that I have anything against
drinking or beer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I personally really, really love beer
myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just noticed that there's a lot of
people that could really benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Internationally just smoking some really
good hash and being one with their cells
[SPEAKER_13]: and achieving flow states.
[SPEAKER_12]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: And connecting with that universe energy
around them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many people that just get lost
in this world and are just not paying
[SPEAKER_12]: attention to the things happening that a
little bit of cannabis can just quiet that
[SPEAKER_12]: noise and sort of bring that tension back
to what's in front of you and what's
[SPEAKER_12]: around you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think people forget that cannabis
can tune us in that way and that we can
[SPEAKER_12]: really connect with others.
[SPEAKER_12]: And ourselves and everything happening
around us.
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, as a young person, when I first
tried cannabis, I was a very scared of
[SPEAKER_12]: life person.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I first tried cannabis with my
friends, it quieted all that noise and all
[SPEAKER_12]: of that fear and all of that anxiousness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really let me actually pay
attention to what was happening around me
[SPEAKER_12]: instead of me just being afraid of what
happened around me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It let me connect with new people.
[SPEAKER_12]: It let me walk up to strangers and say,
Hey, do you want to spend some time
[SPEAKER_12]: together and smoke this joint and get to
know each other?
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really opened up a whole world for
me that I didn't have access to prior to
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for me, I love to see a world where
everybody doesn't have that stigma to try
[SPEAKER_12]: and see what sort of mental health relief
they could get from that experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, it was massive.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the world underestimates the
mental health relief from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the world underestimates the
mental health relief from living in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Kootenay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that too.
[SPEAKER_12]: This place is magical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is absolutely magical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a bunch of like dudes that
didn't want to go fight in the war from
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, let's go start another one of
these up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely are humbled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kootenays is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're nestled in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking at two mountains out my window
right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's snow covered everything and just
everybody here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wants to get to know each other and they
want to help each other's grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they want to help everyone's
everything just rise up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a really beautiful experience to
get to be in this wonderful place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely love the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our leaders would take mushrooms
and smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Terrence McKenna said that quite
some years ago saying that if they just,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if all the people stopped
consuming alcohol for like a week and were
[SPEAKER_05]: consuming psychedelics or cannabis,
the entire world would have like a
[SPEAKER_05]: monstrous, it is crazy how much,
how, how people don't really realized how
[SPEAKER_05]: they were like funneled towards alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you get funneled towards
alcohol, particularly depending on the
[SPEAKER_05]: level of prohibition that your country
has.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I grew up in a police family
and of course cannabis was illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so all of the cops I knew were
alcoholics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was like scary when you think about
it, it was kind of like, Ooh, that seems
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a gun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how old were you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sociologically okay for your
parents to say, okay, you can have a sip
[SPEAKER_07]: of alcohol with your, huh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how old were you when you had your
first taste of alcohol Marcus from your
[SPEAKER_07]: parents?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably have been like eight or
nine years old, but I was also that age
[SPEAKER_05]: when I saw the police come visit my house
in full uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy was big.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name was Rick.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like six, eight and two.
[SPEAKER_05]: 180 pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would drink like a couple of Miller
killers, which I think were two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: cans of beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're, I don't know what
level of white trash you had to be to know
[SPEAKER_05]: about the Miller killers, but,
uh, I was at that level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we, we had them in our fridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were these giant fucking cans,
like super sized cans of beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would come crush two of them and
then jump in his, his police car and,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Hey, what's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: My son was just saying goodbye to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the day he's going to play with his
little buddy, Jude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to, uh, say goodbye to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was a weird thing to just
kind of, and then get kind of get older.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I got older, I remember the entire
vice squad would, would have, would come
[SPEAKER_05]: to my mom's house and she had a pool and
there would be like a pool party in my
[SPEAKER_05]: backyard with the entire vice Winnipeg
vice squad.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd all have these like sort of black,
uh, wife beater shirts with the,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, with Winnipeg vice and a neon pot
leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like, I was like,
okay, that's like, these are not my
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like just swimming in my,
I was a bit of, uh, it was a bit of the
[SPEAKER_05]: black sheep in my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: How awesome is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like this is a whole panel full of
people that could have potentially been
[SPEAKER_05]: that in their families, or at least,
you know, the person who was to educate
[SPEAKER_05]: their families in a way that their family,
that's what kids do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They blow your minds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to find some weird
thing that maybe you've pushed into a
[SPEAKER_05]: crevice and you, oh, I don't want anything
to do with, I don't want to talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just pull it out and put it right
in front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, I can't wait for my kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my kids have already done it,
but they'll do it more and I'll be better
[SPEAKER_05]: for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So try not to, uh, resent anybody who's I
ended up, you know, the years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, well right at high school,
I had a, uh, I ended up working for a con
[SPEAKER_07]: man and he ended up coming over to the
house and saying, I'm going to get your
[SPEAKER_07]: mom to smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember him saying that to my mom
and my stepdad.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, yeah, not a chance in
hell, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, no, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: But years later, after I went through the
hemp industry and then I was in cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry, then my mom was like,
so I'm losing my memory.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I try this marijuana?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, it worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to have teas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I start off with the teas.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a very entry, easy entry point
for, cause she had smoked earlier in her
[SPEAKER_07]: life, but she didn't want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was worried about coughing.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was in her, you know, seventies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it was not something,
uh, that was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to, you know, to actually then have her
use cannabis and then decide, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: this works for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was life changing for me in that sense of
going from, you know, the, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe what you're doing to,
okay, well, what you're doing is fine and
[SPEAKER_07]: normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like it so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So normal said, I want to try this now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my mom's the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom worked for the police for 35 years,
was never going to use cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: never use it in her entire life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was like, she started using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She started going to bed with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she got a grow and a license,
and then she was cutting clones and
[SPEAKER_05]: sharing them with other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like this, like pretty
awesome growth of, uh, just being involved
[SPEAKER_05]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: She got right into it, you know,
planting it in her backyard, having a
[SPEAKER_05]: little indoor growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting, getting, getting cuts for her
brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: So did you show her how to grow or?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, my friend, Al, uh, this guy,
Reggie the Roddy from back in the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: Al has, was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was really like, you bring her,
you know, edibles and clones and all sorts
[SPEAKER_05]: of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really him more than me in
regards to that, but I had shown my uncle
[SPEAKER_05]: how to make hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were also making, well,
I'd showed her how to make hash too.
[SPEAKER_05]: She made hash with me years ago before she
even tried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember because she was,
I don't know how old she was at the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably 60 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: She made full melt hash the first time she
ever made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just was like, and that was with a cake
mixer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when we used to make six star
full melt bubble hash with a cake mixer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we're all professionals now
and we use professional equipment and we
[SPEAKER_05]: all have very high levels of skill.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do remember those days where I would
just put the little Walmart cake mixer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go buy like four or five of those
things before I went to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be like, yeah, dude, I'm going to
bring all these little, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then giving away bubble bags with one
of those little cake mixers was just,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to have been a part of that
point in time where I got to go to
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamaica, a group of people who just have
so much biomass available.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was even before they were planting
plants just to extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just had so much trim or mash as they
would call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That it was a no brainer to go there and
make hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone to this day, if you're going to
Jamaica, bring a set of bubble bags,
[SPEAKER_05]: find a cool dude that has access to a
field, make some fresh frozen bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you leave, just leave the bags
behind because it's a really like
[SPEAKER_05]: life-changing thing to leave a grower with
those bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly they can, I mean, personally,
I wish I could just go to Jamaica and buy
[SPEAKER_05]: the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to make the hash
every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took days of my time to be like,
just to try and buy like a 32 gallon
[SPEAKER_05]: bucket in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, that's going to cost you
like 150 US dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, and it's going to be square and all
weird and fucked up and not fit your bags
[SPEAKER_05]: and just, I don't know, you know,
Nicky T you've been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've dealt with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Finding, finding the right barrels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about ice?
[SPEAKER_09]: You end up finding these blue ones,
these blue ones, these like, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I think they're like from the
fucking government or some shit,
[SPEAKER_09]: these blue barrels that we ended up using
and they're the right size, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're food grade too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the ones.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes time and you don't realize
everything is so slow in Jamaica that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, when you get there, like if I wasn't
me and imposing my will and just nonstop
[SPEAKER_05]: working at making this happen,
I eat the ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be fucking militant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then even still, it takes two and a
half days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, I just started going to Jamaica
for like 20, 30 days at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're on like a five or a six day
trip and it takes you two or three days
[SPEAKER_05]: before you even make your hash,
I would be happy to just arrive and pay
[SPEAKER_05]: someone like a good fee for some nice
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we've got, you know, fully temp
control labs and fucking the hills of,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, of Negril and orange Hill and shit
fucking that we built over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unbelievable, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been back in too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many years.
I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really got to get back there,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to go backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get to the yard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang out and smoke some, some beautiful
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love putting it on top of the steam
pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember freaking the steam pipe guys
out cause they'd be like, no, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: put it on the coals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like moving the pipe away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, dude, trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just let me put this on top of the
coals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, you know, it was like,
Hey, you got more for the coals.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got more for the coals, just dropping
six star right on top of the coals while
[SPEAKER_05]: vaping herb underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about this before,
but if you have an amazing cultivar and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're vaping the, the, the flower,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the hash off of the flower while
simultaneously taking a dab of full melt
[SPEAKER_05]: hash or live hash, rosin or something
along those lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is like the tastiest fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to hit a rip right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we hitting?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to make me want to break out
the steam chalice and take a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first kind of discovered that my
own minor realization, certainly many
[SPEAKER_05]: people knew before I did, but that was
kind of like, you know, one of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: vaporizers that I couldn't really figure
out a vaporizer that existed before that
[SPEAKER_03]: and how powerful and strong life is a
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't see it like in India or
Jamaica or sort of any of those spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Nick and Pete, what are you smoking
on, Nick?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, this is some of my triangle.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm smoking a lot of, a lot of OGs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gone back to like smoking my ghost
OG, my triangle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then like, I've got, I started this
morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I started this thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on split four right now, but I think I
started it with some spritz or it's real
[SPEAKER_09]: like, it's runs candy type of vibe,
but it has this extra little citrus from
[SPEAKER_09]: the, from the Mac lineage and the,
the grape pie lineage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I saw your interview at Terps Basil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The girl's like, what, what do you rather
have?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies or OG?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that's why when you said OG,
I had to laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a thousand percent OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, okay, fuck, I guess you like
the OG.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, it's real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, you ask me right now,
I'm like, I got a ghost OG right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I got the triangle fucking right
next to her fucking.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, why, why do you like the OG?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hits the right receptor site for me,
you know, it, for my pain in my lower
[SPEAKER_09]: back, my sciatic nerve issue, it helps
with that, but I can still function.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clear headed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's creative.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, and then the flavor on top of
it, the, the tennis ball, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: gasoline, lemon fuel type of vibe is just
up my alley, I guess forever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once, once I found OG Kush for the first
time in my homie, Jorge's shed,
[SPEAKER_09]: he opens up this bag, you know,
turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were doing a bunch of work back then
and I was like, Oh my God, I have to have
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I only want that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's different than the, the diesel or
whatever it was, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I needed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And since that day, over 20 years ago,
I can't have enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: I still grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having an issue right now though.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm almost like it's genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some, you know, might say that it's like
that HLVD thing going around.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be something like that,
but fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been growing these OG cuts,
this, you know, ghosts and the SFV and
[SPEAKER_09]: triangle and stuff for, you know,
20 years or some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're just now starting to have some
issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if I can work my way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of it or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing that I can like cut from just
the tops and kind of work my way out of a
[SPEAKER_09]: weird situation, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I definitely want to TC them and clean
them up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess is the goal now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I've had these things for so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's scary when that happens to like
special.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's garden hands too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got people that had been in my garden that
aren't as crazy as I use a different razor
[SPEAKER_09]: blade for every plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got 30 moms right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm OCD.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm super clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everyone's like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it takes being like that for
years, but then, you know, I just went on
[SPEAKER_09]: tour.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm traveling so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't be the only one to have my hands
on these OGs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we wish your OGs the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, due to the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: May they be null and void of HLVD virus
not exist in them and maybe, or HLVD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that shit's terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I'm pretty sure I had seeds from a
champagne hash plant that were 25 years
[SPEAKER_05]: old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I popped those seeds at first,
I thought it was like that bitumen
[SPEAKER_05]: membrane that was stuck on the caudaladon.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the seedling first popped up,
I didn't take it off fast enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes that can like, you know,
damage the caudaladon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if the first set of leaves come
out, the epicoddle, they can kind of even
[SPEAKER_05]: be damaged by it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of thought it was that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was cutting it and cloning it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just growing like it had some
fucked up virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after 25 years, I just I let it go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not have the tools available to me
to keep that particular one alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also cracked a lamb's bread around that
same time, which, Caleb, that's another
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting thing that happened in
history.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cultivar in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people mispronounced it
or couldn't understand the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_05]: patois.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they turned it into breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people for a long time
thought that it was the lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very human thing for us to kind of
create those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only imagine how many of those
misunderstandings are a part of our
[SPEAKER_05]: everyday, you know, conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that one was a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lamb's bread, for sure, as it's a biblical
it's definitely the lamb's bread,
[SPEAKER_05]: not the lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never saw a single cultivar that
they called lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lamb's bread just seemed to be like a kind
of land racy, long flowering, narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: drug cultivar, aka sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw lots of different plants that they
called lamb's bread that were all nice in
[SPEAKER_05]: their own right, but certainly not the
same population.
[SPEAKER_09]: My first time to Jamaica, you know,
I started talking about the OG and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, man, may I have the most wanted.
[SPEAKER_09]: They called it the most wanted,
but then you start seeing what they call
[SPEAKER_09]: OG.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, you know, Jamaicans have a
tendency to want to breed in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's how the island has survived is from
breeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you can't blame them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anytime I brought in a clone only
cultivar to Jamaica, they're like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh yeah, man, we're going to breed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, no, no, no, no, keep this
one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, that special one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, mine may often breed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so many people bringing genetics
there over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was probably some really special,
I would guess that anything that was even
[SPEAKER_05]: close to a land race would have come from
India or that sort of side of things that
[SPEAKER_05]: would have ended up there in those earlier
days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do you think, Sam, you spent some
time in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can remember the time that some guys
were on the street trying to sell herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, they walked up to me and
said, hey, man, you want the pineapple
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I says, well, I know a little bit
about skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to explain to them that I bred
the first skunk, but they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to sell me pineapple skunk,
which was nothing to do with skunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: but whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were like street dealers since then,
like many of the actual growers know who
[SPEAKER_05]: you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's like a very different,
yeah, those guys that used to stand out on
[SPEAKER_05]: the side of the road and you just drive by
from the airport.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of wild times for as illegal
as it was that they were standing there
[SPEAKER_05]: holding like big spears in their hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 420 people walked up to me and said,
hey, we're watching right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a nice number.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been, I do, like I have mentioned
before, I plan on doing 52 episodes of
[SPEAKER_05]: Hash Church this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will be very consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone has any ideas or wants to sort
of, you know, have a little think tank in
[SPEAKER_05]: regards to ideas and concept, it does take
a lot of time and energy to plan a show
[SPEAKER_05]: each week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard to get people to commit for
a specific show in particular,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, and I don't think every show should
be that, you know, the deep dive on very
[SPEAKER_05]: specific subjects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do also like these shows where you
invite a variety of people and everyone
[SPEAKER_05]: just sort of speaks about whatever happens
to come up in conversation or in regards
[SPEAKER_05]: to what they're doing or what they're
looking up to, what they're going to be up
[SPEAKER_05]: to here in 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to hear from any of you that are
on the panel right now in regards to what
[SPEAKER_05]: your kind of 2025 plan things are,
what you kind of, what you're thinking of
[SPEAKER_05]: doing a little differently this year than
maybe you did last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to try and grow a little bit each
year because humans, we do tend to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a quick thing with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to hear from you, Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say my pivot has kind
of been crazy from 2020 when I managed a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and was getting my degree to go
on back to working with athletes and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 2025 has been focused on the people who
are going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we already have their attention and I
think that community knows that we exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 2025 is trying to find a meeting place
for the people who will not listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything once you say the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a group of people who once you say
cannabis, they hear all the negativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal this year is to talk about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that there's human and animal
endocannabinoids, there's plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, and then there's synthetic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my company has created a course that
we're marketing to the NCAA, Major League
[SPEAKER_00]: Baseball, all the pro sports leagues,
and we're using athletes as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: target audience to teach about the
endocannabinoid system because it relates
[SPEAKER_00]: to their performance, it relates to their
diet, and it relates to meditation and
[SPEAKER_00]: mind-body stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we can get all of the pro
athletes, this is why we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky Williams doing this type of stuff,
our goal is essentially to shoot this off
[SPEAKER_00]: like a flare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these scheduling like happens,
it could be like a mountain that crumbles
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't want everybody to feel like we
have no way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the endocannabinoid system is why
we like the shit that we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not educate people on that as a way
that we'll always have out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll always be our kind of anchor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my initiative in 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, like I think people get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, you know, they're ready to talk
anti-cannabis and you tell them that
[SPEAKER_00]: bears, you know, hibernate using
endocannabinoids, when you tell them those
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, it takes them on like a
totally different journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I would invite anybody to
join us on this journey because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just athletes, it's fitness, it's
wellness, it's mind-body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of like the whole
essence of, you know, Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Hash is our gateway, but it's a
gateway to a more holistic approach as
[SPEAKER_00]: civilized people, as we call ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'd love to have an episode where
maybe we bring in some athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people would like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also applies to first responders and
veterans too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I mean, this is everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is our people who need it most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's my 2025 pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a dope episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm in for sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting it at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the last four or five,
well, at least four decades, I've tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out because it's no use talking to
the converted, reaching to the converted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you want to do is you want to reach
the unconverted, whether they're prison
[SPEAKER_03]: guards or sheriffs or preachers or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever is the anti-cannabis people should
be the people we're trying to reach.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that too, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got to start finding a lot of those
people and inviting them on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know where the people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause what I realize is science doesn't
change policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a researcher, I wish it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what changes policy?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people all knowing some
information that the politician doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, what are these people
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should come to this meeting and hear
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll be, now they'll be swayed
to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think like those people who are
anti are always, you know, the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: will make the biggest difference if we
teach them just a little bit of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wade has his hand up and welcome Wade and
happy new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And great conversation this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed the first part of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking, I'll back up for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal for 2025 is to learn how to ask
for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really good at giving help to other
people, but I am spectacularly bad at
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it occurs to me that an excellent
topic for one of our shows would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole area of compassion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've got, we managed to change
the laws around cannabis because of its
[SPEAKER_01]: effects on the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most people, that means it's
effect on my health or my child's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's, it can't hurt to
remind everybody that it's the needs of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that got us where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in too many places, the adult use
slash recreational part of the market has
[SPEAKER_01]: overrun patient access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's particularly an issue if you
don't have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have money, you can usually find in
a legal state, you can find product and
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's what you need and works for
you, but it's typically not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we really need to do and what we
really need is, I think I've heard Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: say, cannabis should be as inexpensive as
cut flowers in a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we could carry that through to
the medical products that we know can be
[SPEAKER_01]: made from this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just stop there for the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly can think of a number of folks
that would welcome the opportunity to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about their work of providing cannabis
products to folks who need it at no cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been one of my things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a topic worth taking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go back to listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably have more to say today,
but right now that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it, Wade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are all great ideas from
Steven's sport medicine, endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: athlete episode to Sam talking about
inviting the other side of the argument
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of preaching to the choir.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be a rather intense, some good
episodes of past church.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I welcome that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Wade, of course, with a beautiful
idea for a show with the basis on passion,
[SPEAKER_05]: that sort of thing that seemed to be the
thing that pushed cannabis over the
[SPEAKER_05]: federal legalization here in Canada and
certainly statewide legalization down in
[SPEAKER_05]: the U S it's so crazy that the guy who
prosecuted Mark Emery in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington was the same guy who like
spearheaded like legalization in that
[SPEAKER_05]: state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what a strange, strange world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compassion is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can remember about 20 or 25 years ago
when the attorney general excuse me,
[SPEAKER_03]: the surgeon general in America was about
to be submitted for appointment by I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: it was from Clinton because it was from
Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they invited me to come and talk to
her before she was taken a friend of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Senate and the Congress for approval
because they were worried she had come out
[SPEAKER_03]: for teaching children masturbation instead
of having sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had come out in favor of teaching
allowing cannabis to be used in American
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were worried that she didn't have
the science strong enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went and talked to her because at the
time I was really at the top of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pyramid when it came to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went and talked to her and I started
to explain why they had sent me the
[SPEAKER_03]: Democratic Party had sent me from Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's and I says, What is it that you
were going to say when they question you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gave her a couple of hard questions
and she goes, Oh, I don't care about the
[SPEAKER_03]: science anywhere in there as much as
compassion.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it helps people, we have to be
compassionate to ill people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was hard for me to disagree with
her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I says, You know what, that is the
best approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Jocelyn elders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jocelyn elders, who was a really nice,
sweet lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I went and met her at her office
in in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's it going to be now?
[SPEAKER_18]: R.F.K.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Oz, Dr. Oz, some other TV celebrity
that this guy is going to point to
[SPEAKER_18]: basically be a human hand grenade inside
our government.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, yeah, I'm very concerned about the
direction that does the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: government not need a hand grenade inside
their government right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just curiosity.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got is about to get the keys to the
White House.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone just got a vaccine from a company
that are serial felons.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the most powerful person in the
world should not be a puppet to dictators.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's always been that way,
though, scarily enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think that the past,
however many governments there have been
[SPEAKER_05]: in both of our countries have not been
like puppets to a dictatorship.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's this is a completely different
situation than any other person that's
[SPEAKER_18]: taken the realm at the White House.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm high enough.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I don't want to turn this into a
political conversation, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: this is the work reality that we're living
in.
[SPEAKER_18]: But Marcus, let's talk about Hashchurch
episode.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, one of the things that you
and I have been have bantered about is
[SPEAKER_18]: perhaps doing a solvent.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we had a solvent list episode,
right, with Nicotet and all the,
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, masters of the solvent solvent
was realm.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, why not do a solvent based
episode?
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dedicated to the memory of our friend
Indra, who's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Horatio.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Horatio.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just trying to think of who would make
a good panel for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I was thinking like Chris
Barone, you know, potentially getting
[SPEAKER_18]: giddy up.
[SPEAKER_18]: I, you know, just don't know, like the
Busy Bee people maybe.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's a lot of innovations going
on in solvent extraction and you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: it's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring on Murphy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Murphy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: Murphy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so proud of Murphy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I met her across the street from
one of our first dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: She was in the salon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to see how far she's come from
budtending for our shop after I pulled her
[SPEAKER_09]: from the salon to like just running the
hydrocarbon world.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, she's like one of my most pride,
you know, proud moments.
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: You should be, Nick, because he,
she is really you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_18]: she doesn't have a chemistry degree at
all, but I can tell you I've sat in many
[SPEAKER_18]: of an audience and listened to her speak.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything she says is just right on time.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, she does her homework.
[SPEAKER_18]: She's very thorough and you know,
the quality of the work speaks for itself,
[SPEAKER_18]: doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you could be the worst hash maker
in the world and know all about it,
[SPEAKER_18]: not be able to translate it to somebody.
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you went in her wake,
you have basically labs that are producing
[SPEAKER_18]: high quality diamonds and getting the most
productivity out of their machines and
[SPEAKER_18]: doing so safely without blowing themselves
up.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, yeah, I'd be the boss.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be doing some R&D right now,
you know, just some more fun, different
[SPEAKER_09]: things, utilizing centrifuges instead of
heat and pressure, if you will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Nick, who else would be good for a
solvent?
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I was thinking like trying to
get the Incredibles crew, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe reaching out to Derek.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm pretty good and in with Max and Telly,
but who would... Either way, Max,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you get a hold of Max, let him know
that he still owes me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, no, sorry, it wasn't Max.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Telly, Telly, Telly, Telly.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love them all.
[SPEAKER_18]: I probably wouldn't go there, but who
would be good to get on a hat?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a girl by the name of... I think
her name was Jacqueline.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: She made her own reactors.
[SPEAKER_05]: She flew up and met me at my facility
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: She had a diamond miner.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe she has a degree in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of good ones out there that
I can think of teaching classes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had mentioned the Busy B guys,
you know, he's a good guy, Boris and them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could bring on, you know,
even the solvent guys, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: the guys that are distributing it,
like Solvent Direct.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could get them to sponsor it and bring
them on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, some of the equipment side
of things like Alex at C1D1 Labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work with all of those guys very,
very closely still.
[SPEAKER_09]: To this day, there's no division between a
lot of us hydrocarbon and solventless
[SPEAKER_09]: guys, even though I got it on my sleeve.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was thinking about, like, JD,
JD Garrick from Illuminated.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think their rigs are just about
the best that are out there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, Nick?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, people are talking really good about
the Illuminated crew and they've been
[SPEAKER_09]: doing a lot of rounds lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Chemtech centrifuges, you know,
for separating sauce from diamonds.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, they have the explosion proof
centrifuges that are used there.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of innovation going on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But talking about playing with even the
solventless side is playing with
[SPEAKER_09]: centrifuges now, which is a trip,
you know, separating membrane from oil
[SPEAKER_09]: with centrifuges.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was doing with Murphy and
them.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the same thing with ultrasonics
also, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing it several decades ago with
ultrasonics and alcohol and just doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: ultrasonic shake for less than one minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we got was just pure gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the cool thing to realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The yield was only about 85%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the cool thing we realized with
using a centrifuge rather than pressing is
[SPEAKER_09]: under vacuum, you know, you can basically
utilize a lot lower temperatures and
[SPEAKER_09]: control temperature under vacuum utilizing
the centrifuge and strains like Oreos that
[SPEAKER_09]: like to me are one of the blandest strains
out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some crazy terpenes came out of pressing
via centrifuge cultivars like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's some cool, you know,
retaining volatile compounds, if you will,
[SPEAKER_09]: with that technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm intrigued by it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really seen it be viable yet,
but always future playing is what I love
[SPEAKER_09]: to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that would be a great episode
on Hash Church, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could get like Murphy and get a few
of these other folks on there to talk
[SPEAKER_18]: about solvents.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's solventless and solvent is
like the yin and the yang, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's there, you know, it wouldn't
be one without the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: like we copy a lot of what they did for
sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in the beginning, it's where the
term even came from, where the term
[SPEAKER_09]: solvents was I was just basically copying
what I was seeing in the hydrocarbon world
[SPEAKER_09]: and being like, well, I want to replicate
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to copy that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make something that dabs with
zero residue.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And Marcus, we have basically we put on
hold the episode about the abstracts guys
[SPEAKER_18]: getting them on with with Nick,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to have the volatile sulfur kind
of I want to have that show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that show, I think Nick is the
gatekeeper to that because it's a matter
[SPEAKER_05]: of everyone is availability, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not his necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's his two colleagues who put the
equipment together that was perceiving the
[SPEAKER_05]: one trillionth, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every time I asked him to speak about
that when he worked at Yakima Chief Hops
[SPEAKER_05]: and they were like finding files,
that's when they found the fourteen
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred files and in the hops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was because of this piece of equipment
or it was really multiple pieces of
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment kind of jerry-rigged together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, these two people are the
people that can speak to that piece of
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones that did it and they did
and they ran it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he just doesn't, you know, want to
speak on their behalf, even though he has
[SPEAKER_05]: no, yeah, because it's totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd love for the abstract and you and
a whole, you know, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, Ian gives a great talk,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_18]: He gave a talk.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he gave two talks at BizCon this
year and one of his associates Twinkle
[SPEAKER_18]: also spoke and you know, she gives a
really good talk.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah, I mean, this is I think like the
cutting edge frontier of cannabis
[SPEAKER_18]: chemistry today is these thiols.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like we know about the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_18]: We know about the cannabinoids,
the thiols.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think of like some of the last nuts to
crack here.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other thing that's really cool
about it is that, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_18]: approaching this.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love the word that they use.
[SPEAKER_18]: They call them flavorants, you know.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, these are flavorants.
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, would they be different in
different, you know, plants or different
[SPEAKER_18]: fruits or different vegetables?
[SPEAKER_18]: No.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mother Nature has the same chemistry set
in all of her products.
[SPEAKER_18]: Plants and all of her fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, they find similarities
between hops and cannabis, but they also
[SPEAKER_18]: find some of the dankness that you find in
certain other vegetables and some of the
[SPEAKER_18]: citrus notes and some of the fruity notes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, again, there's lots of
commonalities in those chemistries.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the Hash Church audience would
love that because I think it would be a
[SPEAKER_18]: great discussion to understand.
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, part of the artisan nature of
small, you know, artisan cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_18]: preservation of those volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe they're not necessarily terpenes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe they're these sulfur compounds or
esters or aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_18]: But these groups are basically at that
frontier cracking that nut.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's, to me, the most exciting stuff
going on in cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Laura.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if they're contributing to
modulating or potentiating the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to find that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to find that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's really, really interesting to
me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're going to find that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to be, I think.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm actually going to speak with Ian
this week.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know, but he's got a couple of
projects in mind.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, yeah, how they potentiate and
modulate is going to be part of that
[SPEAKER_18]: discussion, Sam.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I'll reach out to you between now
and next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Laura.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to keep that rolling.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to comment on the
episodes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Steven, just three quick things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Steven talked about the one with the
athletes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to see an array like the kind
of spread of a boxer with an X game
[SPEAKER_13]: athlete, with a tennis player,
with a soccer player.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be cool to see the spectrum of
athletes and their perspective to see them
[SPEAKER_13]: connect on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the one with service people,
I would love to for a Cal Fire person to
[SPEAKER_13]: be on there talking about their grow,
because there's a couple of Cal Fire guys
[SPEAKER_13]: out here that have their own garden.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple people who were former
cops, former deputies in the area of
[SPEAKER_13]: sheriffs that have their own grows.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a different world here.
[SPEAKER_13]: The cops kind of approach it differently.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it'd be interesting to hear that side
of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on the hydrocarbon side of that,
I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would personally love to see some of the
guys from Leaf Labs California.
[SPEAKER_13]: They work the Busy Bee system.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't speak much to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that their building is basically a
closed loop.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were responsible last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: They made three million grams just in
their hydrocarbon department alone.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've been doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's some big producers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Big shout out to Gary and Micah and those
guys who run the lab up there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So those would be some great guys to hear
from.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_13]: He schooled me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Frenchy schooled me.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was talking to this group of
hydrocarbon guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thought Frenchy was just going to do
the old solvent lists is somehow superior.
[SPEAKER_13]: But he was like, you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was saying how that technology is
precious.
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually comes from France,
Nice, France.
[SPEAKER_13]: Terpene extraction is a really old,
ancient, precious art.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a precious art to his place from
Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't say it as eloquently as this
gentleman did, but he really schooled
[SPEAKER_13]: these.
[SPEAKER_13]: They, their jaws dropped to the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like, I was not expecting Frenchy to
say that, but that was excellent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kind of hearing his perspective of
how deep of a connection he has to that
[SPEAKER_13]: side of terpene extraction.
[SPEAKER_13]: Coming from the perfume industry for so
long ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The understanding of preserving those
aromatic volatiles the best that we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a big part of the hash
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's why I just love hash
over rosin every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way the glands hold in everything just
seems to be more preserving.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, it seems to be, well,
it's the delivery system that the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: decided to produce it out of.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like to just have it in that
little casing, that little gland head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, uh, I'm always the most excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like rosin and whipped and greasy and
sugary and all the different ways.
[SPEAKER_18]: Marcus, you know, it dawned on me too,
as I was looking through some previous
[SPEAKER_18]: episodes, a hash church from years ago,
that maybe we should have, um,
[SPEAKER_18]: Jessica, uh, back on and maybe even like a
patients episode, you know, where we can
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe, um, Wendy and Colton on and,
you know, um, see how they're doing,
[SPEAKER_18]: see how these patients are doing,
you know, um, we're all patients in a way,
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wendy and Colton.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just taking notes while we do this.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was going to mention maybe,
maybe doing an analytics episode.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where we do an episode comparing analytics
and yields, um, from different strains,
[SPEAKER_17]: whether it be solvent lists or solvent
based dry sift versus water hash versus
[SPEAKER_17]: hydrocarbon per se.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it'd be cool to bring everyone
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Rebecca, you said, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, well, uh, you were talking about the
patients one again.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Jessica and, uh, Jessica from
Pittsburgh and Antonia, her daughter.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, I was thinking of a forest,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a forest.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, we haven't heard from him in a
while.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, Wade, is, is there an update on
those folks?
[SPEAKER_03]: A pyramid, but he came to medical campus
and, uh, I went and talked to her and I
[SPEAKER_05]: started to, sorry, I had to mute Dr.
David's mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, and welcome Dr. David Allen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, his, he came in, I think he had a TV
on in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, uh, it was coming through loud,
but, uh, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good buddy.
[SPEAKER_18]: So wait, I had asked if he'd heard from
forest lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, the short version is Silas has
been free of seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, going on four years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's in high school, um, still has
some challenges health-wise, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, the type of diabetes that's
inherited from the genes is now a new
[SPEAKER_01]: threat in Silas's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole nother dimension about
getting food into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he's, he's doing well enough that
he's as big as forest is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really know if any of you met
forest in person, but he was, he's a large
[SPEAKER_01]: human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, Silas, his physical body is
doing quite well other than the diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there is a challenge that the,
uh, specific version of a plant that was
[SPEAKER_01]: named MediHaze um, long story short,
yeah, that particular version of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we seem to be, uh, out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we're getting low on the oil that
we made from it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so forest has been, um,
exploring what other cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: what other versions of the cannabis plant
might provide that exact lovely
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of chemistry that gave such
miraculous results for, for Silas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to say that forest himself out
of survival has, has really pulled back
[SPEAKER_01]: from any cannabis work other than trying
to keep Silas healthy and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go to school and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's the report on forest and
Silas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will, I've spoken to forest just
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll ask him if he would be open to coming
on the show and talking about his
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last four or five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: The MediHaze oil that you're talking
about, was it analyzed for terpenic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we do have, uh, test results from,
uh, different farmers of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any of it in front of me,
Sam, but, uh, yeah, I assure you,
[SPEAKER_01]: forest is working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I will get up to speed with him
on what's, uh, what he sees as a potential
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit for Silas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I would love to share that
information, um, with you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's another great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have it in the notes here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good idea for shows, which just as I
looked up and saw Dr. Allen on the screen,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, there's like probably a
couple more we could throw in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more good ideas we come up with for
shows, the better, less stress on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can make sure we deliver something
positive every week for geez, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the three to 400 or 500 people that seem
to, uh, want to hang out with us for three
[SPEAKER_05]: or four hours on a Sunday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing Dr. Allen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, go ahead, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, just, uh, some quick, uh, more,
I guess, episode ideas, um, perhaps like a
[SPEAKER_10]: more music one.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are like rappers now that
specifically rap about dabbing and hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I bet they'd be an interesting talk
and also, um, more on what Wolverine Dabbs
[SPEAKER_11]: was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there are like a handful of people who
are going to wash and make rosin or hash
[SPEAKER_11]: from whatever their favorite cultivar is,
no matter what the yields are.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so like highlighting, I guess,
like the people who are doing that with
[SPEAKER_11]: the turpaniline dominant stuff,
the Hayes hashes, like the Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_11]: hash, like, uh, Jerry with first cut farms
or someone on the East coast that also has
[SPEAKER_11]: a Vietnamese hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're the only two people I know,
like in the whole world that do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, that type of, um, yes,
episode would be interesting, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, uh, hash and food pairings,
which is definitely like a bleeding edge,
[SPEAKER_11]: um, with like the, the chef at the
concierge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Campus Alex or the hash sommelier and,
um, the food and hash fruit pairings,
[SPEAKER_11]: rare fruits and rare hash pairings that
she does.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there's a lot that goes there to be
like breaking the stigma of hash for
[SPEAKER_11]: flower users or the completely
uninitiated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have them all down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I particularly liked the hash and food
pairing once I did an interview years ago
[SPEAKER_05]: with my friend Merlin and it was kind of
in that vein.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was this guy, Pete Evans,
and he seemed to be a pretty cool dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, I guess he was pretty
mainstream back home, but just right when
[SPEAKER_05]: I met him, he just was like, and just like
took a right turn in his career and became
[SPEAKER_05]: this like, he was like the enemy on TV in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just like, uh, yeah, I'll tell you
when mainstream comes after you and wants
[SPEAKER_05]: to decimate you watch out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think it might've happened to him
at least for his career, but he was a cool
[SPEAKER_05]: guy and it was all, he was a chef.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had sold like, I don't know,
20 or 30, um, uh, cookbooks and he was
[SPEAKER_05]: quite well known.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a very mainstream chef in
Australia, uh, very well known like on T
[SPEAKER_05]: they're cable TV and stuff and,
and very well known.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he suddenly became very, um,
he definitely would have been speaking
[SPEAKER_05]: against the COVID-19 vaccine vocally right
when it was happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, uh, that's who Pete was.
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless him.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing Dr. Allen?
[SPEAKER_05]: I muted you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you have to unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can push this button that says ask to
unmute and it might bring up a button on
[SPEAKER_05]: your screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is trickier to find the mute and unmute
button when you're on this zoom on a
[SPEAKER_05]: phone.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there you are, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy new year.
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy new year, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a couple of things I would like to
say about this conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the first thing is growing cannabis is
a human right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's why, because if you can't put it in
your food, if it costs $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can't grow cannabis,
it prevents you from using it as a
[SPEAKER_16]: nutraceutical.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, everybody should know that
cannabis is a nutraceutical and metabolic
[SPEAKER_16]: essential.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason it's a metabolic essential
is because if you block the CB1 receptors,
[SPEAKER_16]: sperm cannot enter the ovum.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's necessary for you have an intact
endocannabinoid signaling system for
[SPEAKER_16]: conception to occur.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I call it the endocannabinoid
signaling system because as you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: many of the scientists that, that studied
cannabis, uh, were affected by the society
[SPEAKER_16]: that hated cannabis and they didn't know
the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they named it the cannabinoid
system and it's not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that always irritated me.
[SPEAKER_16]: They endo and even Rushulam called it the
endo cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the, I call it the endo cannabinoid
signaling system because that tells the
[SPEAKER_16]: function of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a chemical communication system that
regulates all, all of anatomy and
[SPEAKER_16]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's the endo cannabinoid signaling
system.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you as always, Dr. Alan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you as always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, uh, that you should definitely be
in touch with Stephen Philpott and with
[SPEAKER_05]: what he's doing with his course and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you would be of good value to
Stephen to, uh, uh, put, put you guys,
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, I'd love to talk to anybody to
collaborate, collaborate with.
[SPEAKER_16]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Elaborate, not calibrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not calibrate, it's collaborate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the endo calibrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about it in my head,
but you did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You sneaky Pete.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some good ideas for shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, can I suggest one more shoe markets?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got 52 to, uh, fulfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, one thing I'd like to suggest we talk
about is, uh, cannabis and mental health,
[SPEAKER_12]: because I don't think that that's
discussed enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think for some people it's been such
a massive tool and key for them to access
[SPEAKER_12]: their life and their community that I
think this would be a great platform to
[SPEAKER_12]: just have one more place where we can talk
about this, where people are actually
[SPEAKER_12]: listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's pretty, pretty good
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a very tricky one in the
sense that do you go the way where you
[SPEAKER_05]: only show people who had good mental
health?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, experiences from it, or do you also
add the other side of the scope,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is, which I only know about this
because I had a roommate who definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: was not better off smoking cannabis,
at least to the levels that he was doing
[SPEAKER_05]: it at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so there's some people who are
affected negatively by their mental health
[SPEAKER_05]: from, from cannabis, whether it's
overusing it, whether it's like taking
[SPEAKER_05]: high concentration tabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only met a few of them in my life,
but I have happened to live with one and
[SPEAKER_05]: knew him very, very, very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly wasn't mixing it up and I
was certainly not biased to be painting
[SPEAKER_05]: that picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I tried to sort of deny that picture
for a long time as I was quite younger,
[SPEAKER_05]: but as, as it was undeniable at one point,
I sort of, I could see it that,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, yeah, not maybe not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wade, you've got your hand up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump in because, uh,
one of the things that I think hash
[SPEAKER_07]: church, uh, you, you hit your mute again,
Wade, you started into that and you said
[SPEAKER_07]: hash church, then you hit your,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, shaky hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think it's one of the challenges
that we on hash church need to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: We routinely glorify heroic doses,
be it dabs or, uh, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, six star, um, in a, in a bowl,
uh, with a trail of wooden matches and
[SPEAKER_01]: screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a certain glorification
because we, the panelists actually have an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid signaling system that
loves that experience that feels in
[SPEAKER_01]: enlivened uplifted, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's true is that is not the case
for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start talking about mental
health and cannabis, I really think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to put into that conversation
how the dose dependent cannabis is and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you take it into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis chemistry is radically
different if you're eating it as versus
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, but we, we need to share
that information is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing I would say is,
um, I love getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't tell you how proud I am that you
call it the endocannabinoid signaling
[SPEAKER_16]: system.
[SPEAKER_16]: We w we should spread this worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you're not the only one
that thinks it's important to have the
[SPEAKER_05]: proper, um, language chimera who's not
here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is in the YouTube chat or he was
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, he's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he's very much about like making sure
that we share the same language,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's an accurate language is that
it's the properly agreed upon language.
[SPEAKER_18]: Terminology is very correct.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Mark, two other ideas for episodes of
it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we, we did this once before we had the
all woman panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then did we ever pull this off?
[SPEAKER_18]: Spouse church.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we ever do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We never, we never did.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never did spouse.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we weren't, we, if I remember
correctly, weren't you and I thinking
[SPEAKER_18]: about this and we weren't going to tell
anybody.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then all of a sudden there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Your wife was going to start it.
[SPEAKER_18]: My wife was going to get on.
[SPEAKER_18]: We were going to have spouse church.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: But we can't tell anyone it's going to
happen, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't, we can't telegraph it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, make it spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, two crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have a dozen ideas now just from
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I will be reaching out to each and
every one of you that offered me an idea
[SPEAKER_05]: because you will be helping me organize
and co-host that episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: So throwing all these great ideas,
Dr. Mark, but, uh, well, Caleb as well
[SPEAKER_05]: dropped three and yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should be good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Should be fun to Caitlin's idea of mental
health.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think somebody good to have on
that idea, like panel, uh, would be Dr.
[SPEAKER_13]: Miyabi shields.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and I think also, um, Dr. Ethan Russo
as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, that would be an amazing, you know,
that's just two to start, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: that'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This, this month we should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing from Dr. Miyabi as well as her
colleague, uh, Riley, Dr. Riley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Riley.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been in touch with both of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're planning on coming on and letting
us know all about their new podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also spoke to them about
potentially being a part of, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Allen and I's new show, the cannabis
journal club.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all coming together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I wrote that down, uh,
for Caitlin's show on mental health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll have to, well, what I would
suggest that everyone that gave an idea
[SPEAKER_05]: like Stephen, who talked about sports
medicine and the endocannabinoid signaling
[SPEAKER_05]: system and the athletes, uh, Sam,
who talked about inviting the other side
[SPEAKER_05]: of the argument for some, for some rather
intense episodes, Wade with his idea for a
[SPEAKER_05]: show on compassion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mark came in with the solvent episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've already been a little bit on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're creating, this is how it's easiest
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We create a list.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we create the phone numbers,
the email contacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once I have multiple ways of
getting ahold of them, I can track them
[SPEAKER_05]: down and it becomes fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think we should do a solvent,
uh, less show, I E a full mouth bubble
[SPEAKER_05]: hash episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also Dr. Mark, which was, I just have
it as Nick Ziegler, the abstract twinkle,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick Ziegler, his two colleagues,
you, Jeremy Plumb, Chimera, Stunkman Sam,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, the patient show with Wendy and
Colton, Jessica and forest and other
[SPEAKER_05]: folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that ties into possibly similar to
Wade's idea for a compassion episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wolverine buds mentioned an analytics
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Caleb had a bunch of ideas,
music, rappers who sing about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, uh, highlighting the people who are
washing terpene, terpene dominant
[SPEAKER_05]: materials, like the real small percentage
of the small percentage and then hash and
[SPEAKER_05]: food pairings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I have a doctor show with you,
Dr. Allen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Caitlin mentioned cannabis and mental
health, positive and negative sides of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I added Dr. Mia B and, and, uh,
um, Dr. Ethan Russo there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Dr. Mark mentioned the all woman panel
and Dr. Mark also mentioned spouse church,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is pretty, pretty hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a bunch of ideas that those of
you that are watching right now,
[SPEAKER_16]: the 400 Mark, I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, please.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, many anti cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_16]: People come up to me and one of the first
thing they say is, uh, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_16]: associated with schizophrenia and,
um, you know, there's no studies that
[SPEAKER_16]: proved a direct correlation, but,
but here's some information for people.
[SPEAKER_16]: People have been smoking cannabis for
hundreds of years and the incidence of
[SPEAKER_16]: schizophrenia is the same in every
country.
[SPEAKER_16]: All over the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, and, uh, the incidence of cannabis use
has skyrocketed since the fifties.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if schizophrenia was directly
associated with cannabis use, then there
[SPEAKER_16]: should be a massive increase in
schizophrenia since the 1950s,
[SPEAKER_16]: which has not occurred.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, does that mean that's delineative
that there's no correlation at all?
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, no, it doesn't, but, uh, people that
are in mental trouble use cannabis because
[SPEAKER_16]: it calms them down.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you would expect schizophrenia
people to be using cannabis at a little
[SPEAKER_16]: bit higher rate than the average person,
but there should be schizophrenics
[SPEAKER_16]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the same thing about driving.
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, they, they associate cannabis with bad
driving habits, but there's a U S patent
[SPEAKER_16]: on, or there's a study on this.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called, uh, uh, driving habits under
the influence or sec is called sexual
[SPEAKER_16]: differences in the driving performance of
people are using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what they did was this was an NIH
study, national Institute of health.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what they did was they took people and
they put them on driving simulators and
[SPEAKER_16]: they, they would put like animals driving
out in front of them and they would test
[SPEAKER_16]: their reaction times and their amount of
crash avoidance.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, you have to kind of look through
the whole study to really delineate what,
[SPEAKER_16]: what's really going on because the summary
is a, a government summary and they're not
[SPEAKER_16]: going to say, okay, it's, it's safe to use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you read the tables, especially
table two, it proves that women,
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, what they did was they, they give them
cannabis and examine them.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they would, or they let me do it
first without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they would let them do it after
smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And women had no difference in,
in reaction time or crash avoidance,
[SPEAKER_16]: but men had 1.1 seconds faster reaction
time and three times better crash
[SPEAKER_16]: avoidance.
[SPEAKER_16]: So now this isn't a definitive study that
shows everything, but on some studies,
[SPEAKER_16]: apparently even government studies,
it shows that you are no worse a driver
[SPEAKER_16]: when you're smoking and maybe even safer
driver, uh, when you're smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_16]: but you can't just look at the summary.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to look at the charts to
determine what I just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just coming out of left field constantly
with all the most random, awesome shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Allen for sharing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of studies, you know,
in the last, uh, you know, five years
[SPEAKER_07]: regarding, you know, safety and,
uh, you know, travel in, in vehicles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course the NTSB and others have
buried these studies because they don't
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily want that information out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you actually do do a Google search
on it, you will find quite a few different
[SPEAKER_07]: studies in different countries regarding
cannabis use and driving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we, of course, uh, here in America,
we are dealing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the insurance institutes are still trying
to find a pathology or a way to test for
[SPEAKER_07]: how high you are, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there is actually no test to
figure out if you are intoxicated
[SPEAKER_07]: regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is tests regarding, right,
how alcohol is done.
[SPEAKER_07]: But currently the only way to know,
you know, you can do a blood test until
[SPEAKER_07]: there's cannabis in your system,
but that can stay up to 40 plus days
[SPEAKER_07]: depending on your usage, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is no definitive test that
proves cannabis impairment at this time
[SPEAKER_07]: scientifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is what a lot of us have
found anecdotally from our own experiences
[SPEAKER_07]: from using cannabis and driving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but it's fascinating that science is,
you know, caught up to the anecdotal
[SPEAKER_07]: discussions as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you could do a deeper dive on,
you know, some of those studies regarding
[SPEAKER_07]: in countries because there's European
countries in the EU have done these
[SPEAKER_07]: studies as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have proven exactly what Dr.
Allen has stated is that the, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: the cannabis drivers are sometimes safer
than non cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the same person not using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition, there's probably a major
difference between chronic users who are
[SPEAKER_16]: experienced and new users.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, Steven, you just said that we all
metabolize cannabinoids differently,
[SPEAKER_07]: so they'll never be able to find a test
that will be able to single shot is what
[SPEAKER_07]: your science is telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand why the blood alcohol
content work, it's because we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how alcohol is metabolized by the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that consistently enough to go,
if you have this much alcohol in your
[SPEAKER_00]: blood, we're going to consider that into
impaired or intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, you would be trying to like
shoot a moving target, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like in space, trying to do
something crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the officer would have asked you,
are you a chronic user or a newbie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's just so many factors that
play into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like even the medical use,
you know, I'm like, Hey, what about the
[SPEAKER_00]: person who has Parkinson's who consumes
cannabis to actually stop their tremors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they then safer when their system has
now been regulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids don't actually equal
impairment all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a net increase in
function.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, uh, Dr. Zachary Walsh,
who's based out of UBCO, he did,
[SPEAKER_19]: um, I remember back in 2018, I want to say
that he was doing some research into
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis use and driving.
[SPEAKER_19]: And just like you guys are saying back
then, he was communicating exactly the
[SPEAKER_19]: same point that it's very individualistic.
[SPEAKER_19]: As well as someone who's new to it versus
someone who's experienced with cannabis
[SPEAKER_19]: would have different, you know,
potential levels of impairment.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so ultimately it's problematic to try
to create like a standard protocol.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas with alcohol, you know,
blood alcohol content is relative to how
[SPEAKER_19]: much alcohol is in you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if you're bigger, small,
maybe if you're a bigger person,
[SPEAKER_19]: you can have a bit more alcohol.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're smaller, you could, you less
would put you over the limit, but with
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabis, it doesn't really work in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're missing the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how they should be doing the
study.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what you think,
how well someone reacts or doesn't react.
[SPEAKER_05]: The study should be about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give keys to a person who hasn't
consumed cannabis and they jump in the car
[SPEAKER_05]: and they drive away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you get that same person high on
cannabis, maybe uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them will take those keys and get
in a car and drive.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the difference it has from alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the study because alcohol inhibits,
you know, you're like, Oh, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Dunning Krueger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alcohol is like Dunning Krueger on crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like steroid Dunning Krueger.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just like, I'm so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fucking, I'll be okay to drive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is like humble pie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got higher than I want to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a hundred percent of people will be
like, I don't want to drive right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great point.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cannabis has its own governor.
[SPEAKER_16]: I, especially, you know, if you smoke
cannabis, I don't want to drive.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll find something else to do.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's, it's actually its own
governor.
[SPEAKER_16]: It prevents you from going out and being
crazy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it time and time again, mainly
because I guess I was experimenting with
[SPEAKER_05]: these super high percentage and quality
and purity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone I was around me was kind of
getting exposed to this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes unwittingly where they would
just be like, Whoa, that was really
[SPEAKER_05]: strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people would go and get in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd follow all the steps that they were
going to do, but then they get in their
[SPEAKER_05]: car and they would just sit out in front
of my house or maybe down the street at
[SPEAKER_05]: the stop sign, but very close.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was like 25 to 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would just sit there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'd kind of realize and be like,
Hey, like I don't can't be sitting out in
[SPEAKER_05]: front of my house, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a heat score, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Get in my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd bring them in the house and then
just be like, wow, like, that's so
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they left my house hammered,
like beyond drunk, like barely able to
[SPEAKER_05]: make it to their car, they would for sure
drive like for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would think that is an absolutely
great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dunning Kruger should do some alcohol
tests because there's something to be said
[SPEAKER_05]: for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that that weird mentality where you
think you're better at something or more
[SPEAKER_05]: capable of something in an in a mindset
that you absolutely are not brave and
[SPEAKER_04]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brave and crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you that's a liquid courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might be right about the Dunning
Kruger thing though, because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars to confidence curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the less knowledge you have,
the higher your confidence is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the moment you get, but the moment you
get 1% more piece of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: your confidence drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the less information you have,
the more confident you will remain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's no such thing as an expert in
the endo cannabinoid signaling system
[SPEAKER_16]: because we're in the infancy of this
science because the science has been
[SPEAKER_16]: repressed by law for 40 years or more.
[SPEAKER_16]: And no one knows everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: And my advice to you is if anybody says
I'm a expert grower, be careful because
[SPEAKER_16]: they may not be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was like the great debate of
LeBron James and Michael Jordan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Jordan never ever ever in the days
called himself like the greatest to ever
[SPEAKER_05]: play the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's other people do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have other people saying that for
you, then great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they can they can do that if
they like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're saying it yourself,
like I remember when when Sam and I
[SPEAKER_05]: started Legends of Hash, and people would
like I can't remember where I first saw
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with these attacks, like those guys
are so full of themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They think they're legends of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sam and I were like, What the fuck is
this guy talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're, we, we were their master
baiters.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they, we were selling the idea of
like, appreciating hash being a hash
[SPEAKER_05]: aficionado.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really what Legends was about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would, we would sort of
promote for the evening, a legend like one
[SPEAKER_05]: year, it was the gardens of Kaffur,
which Sam was talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it was also different, like,
sort of characters in hashish cultures
[SPEAKER_05]: over the years that we would celebrate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: City, city.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We we celebrated him one year,
there was a whole variety of them that we
[SPEAKER_05]: did over the 13 years that we did it in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Babakoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Babakoo was another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you came and sat down at the
Legends of Hash dinner, there'd be a
[SPEAKER_05]: little folded out piece of paper for you
that would that would have this storyline
[SPEAKER_05]: on who we were celebrating that year at
the Legends of Hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, we never were celebrating
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring back the real legends.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring it back.
[SPEAKER_16]: The original gangsters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a small, special little event.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it'd be fun to get a lot of
those people in a room together again one
[SPEAKER_05]: day, because that was, that was quite an
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those old Amsterdam days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would have known that those would have
been the days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have never guessed that Amsterdam
would change so drastically in regards to
[SPEAKER_05]: how it viewed Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You surprised me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't that surprise you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just ask me a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was wondering if it surprised you
at how Holland, the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective on Cannabis changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved to the Netherlands after visiting
it in 84 and 85.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, it's completely changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, we were driving down the
freeway and my friend Rob was smoking a
[SPEAKER_03]: big giant Reaper and we pulled,
a cop pulled up next to us and put his
[SPEAKER_03]: finger at Rob when we were driving and he
freaked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was going to eat the joint or
do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cop shook his finger back and
forth and pointed to seatbelt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob didn't have a seatbelt on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once he did that, the cop drove up and
said goodbye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way you want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today, that's not how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will absolutely drive you while
intoxicated and take your license away for
[SPEAKER_03]: a period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be pulled over while
you're driving or under the intoxication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's easy enough for me to avoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love puffing, but I don't have to be
puffing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire time I'm driving in a car,
it's like you could just have a giant
[SPEAKER_05]: session way before and get whatever you
need to get out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not one we're going to be
changing the minds of many on anytime
[SPEAKER_05]: soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think personally, I don't think there
should really have to be a test.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if it's an intoxication,
whether it's a pharmaceutical or alcohol
[SPEAKER_05]: or even someone that for whatever reason
was legitimately unable to drive properly
[SPEAKER_05]: on cannabis, if you're like a police
officer, you should be trained at least to
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize what being intoxicated looks
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean you have to identify what
they're intoxicated on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to be like, I don't feel
comfortable letting this person drive.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Australia, I saw police pulling over
cars and testing the passengers for
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that on the way to Mullumbimby or
Nimbin?
[SPEAKER_16]: It was on the way to Nimbin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like some Kootenay shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did stuff in the Kootenays like that
back in the day where if you were pulled
[SPEAKER_05]: over during the season where it was time
to plant your plants and you had any type
[SPEAKER_05]: of gardening gear like shovels or pots or
soil or tarps, it could really lead you to
[SPEAKER_05]: be under an investigation just from
getting pulled over at a roadblock with
[SPEAKER_05]: gardening supplies in the back of your
truck.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally called that though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nimbin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weak sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wow, like you really don't just
dislike this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they hate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a very strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost disconcerting how much they
hate it.
[SPEAKER_16]: They hate it because they can't use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sometimes I think that's a good part
of it, but there's got to be a reason why
[SPEAKER_05]: they hated it in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of appreciated the using of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some other value they get out of
it by hating on it, by keeping it illegal,
[SPEAKER_05]: by making it unaccessible.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge value that they get for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's yeah, that's another show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So too is freaking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who said earlier?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they freaked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Rob freaking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole show right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go into the depths of what it is
that is freaking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is the worst feeling ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens in an instant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Often it happens from a thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the worst reaction where I don't
know if it's just like, I always think of
[SPEAKER_05]: it as like pumping a giant shot of
adrenaline into my body, into my brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows what exactly is happening in
the chemistry of the infamous freak out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And can any good come from freaking out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Next on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one level of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't all have to be, I got high and
had a bad experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally the same experience that
you just said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or realizing that you have to do the Jedi
mind trick in the moment, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no, this is not the marijuana you
were smelling officer.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, this is not the situation that you
believe it to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It read those situations.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got stories.
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember with pride when I was busted
about 15 years ago in a hotel room,
[SPEAKER_16]: I was set up and there was like five
police in the hotel room and I'm sitting
[SPEAKER_16]: there on handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I told the police, you guys don't have
the education or the educational level to
[SPEAKER_16]: understand that you're hurting people in
your own family by enforcing these
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_16]: People in your own family could benefit
from cannabis, but you don't know that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said that to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like an MD at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you were actively doing surgery.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty crazy when they started
arresting the surgeons.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it really goes to show you that
like all you have to do is speak out in
[SPEAKER_05]: promotion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why for so long, so many people hid
their cannabis use because it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: like, it just kind of wasn't worth the
potential life altering problems that came
[SPEAKER_05]: with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking to all of you residents of the
state of Texas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: I got something to say about that.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a really important point.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, as a heart surgeon, I was a
specialist in protecting the heart from
[SPEAKER_16]: what's called reperfusion injury.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I read the cannabinoid patent
cannabinoids as antioxidants and
[SPEAKER_16]: neuroprotections.
[SPEAKER_16]: And in that patent, it actually says that
cannabis CBD will be used for open heart
[SPEAKER_16]: surgery, um, uh, during coronary artery
bypass.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I immediately recognize, holy shit,
this has great potential, but I couldn't
[SPEAKER_16]: tell any of my colleagues anything about
this because if I said anything about
[SPEAKER_16]: these cannabinoids can protect the heart
and brain during surgery, it would
[SPEAKER_16]: immediately out me as a cannabis use user.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I couldn't say anything to my fellow
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to mention one thing you were
talking about cannabis and driving the
[SPEAKER_03]: first studies that showed that cannabis
was likely making the driver safer was
[SPEAKER_03]: done in 1994 in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a study by
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. HWJ Roeb, R-O-B-B-E in 1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had to do it in the Netherlands
because they could not get permission at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time to do the actual driving studies
in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they came, worked with the university
here and did the studies and did it was
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely true that the, uh, driving was
safer because people had a tendency to
[SPEAKER_03]: slow down rather than, you know,
the way a drunk will speed up cause he's
[SPEAKER_03]: invincible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got bunches of them because I used to
sell them from the international hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: association.
[SPEAKER_16]: This reviewed on cannabis journal club for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try and find you a copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's tucked away with all the rest of
my cannabis, uh, 10,000 fricking items
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say it's more than 10,000,
but I could just be completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll make sure you guys get in touch
and to help out in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just, I do have a stack of those books.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just not here at my house,
but I might have a single copy here,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I can share with you, but,
uh, at the very least I can, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: connect you with the book.
Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Robert Melamed had the biggest
collection that I know of, of cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: scientific articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got, I've got four or 5,000 PDFs
and I've got, uh, more than 2000 books on
[SPEAKER_03]: the subject.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you need to be involved in cannabis
journal club.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on the list for certain.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of the few MDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Alan, do we have any way to figure out
or find out what happened to, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Malameed's work?
[SPEAKER_07]: He passed away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the other year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do we have any idea if he left his,
uh, his work somewhere?
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a, uh, a number to one of his close
friends, but, uh, that's all I have,
[SPEAKER_16]: but he was a genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved listening to him talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a real great way of speaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could definitely feel and see how
intelligent he was, but he was also like a
[SPEAKER_05]: tripper and a, you know, like a real just
lover of, of getting high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: He made connections between nonlinear
thermodynamics and the way the body has
[SPEAKER_18]: evolved, which is really a very insightful
way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if you think about it ever since
big bang, the universe has become more
[SPEAKER_18]: random, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Entropy is increasing and he was able to
kind of pull it together into understand
[SPEAKER_18]: why certain biological phenomena are
underpinned on defeating thermodynamics
[SPEAKER_18]: and coming from someone like myself,
who, you know, I'm a PhD chemist.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to learn thermodynamics,
every part of it, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_18]: I could really appreciate his thinking.
[SPEAKER_18]: He was definitely a very unique person.
[SPEAKER_18]: In the way he thought about solving
problems.
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss him and I never met him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he only made it onto a couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_18]: He was on a couple of episodes,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was super confrontational when he
got on, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I remember him coming to blows.
[SPEAKER_18]: I forget with who, maybe with,
uh, Todd, who didn't, didn't they have a
[SPEAKER_18]: little bit of a, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was something I always, I always got
a kick out of that when it happens on hash
[SPEAKER_05]: church because it's funny, but,
uh, yes, he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um, yeah, he, he, he has a couple of
interesting YouTube videos up,
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, that are definitely worthwhile
watching, but you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: you guys talk about your literature club
and everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to participate too, as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have you on the list.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm one of those people who believes that
we do have a crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can see into the future by ironically
looking into the past.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so when the scientists look at the
scientific literature, we were all
[SPEAKER_18]: standing on the shoulders of giants,
even Michelle Roger Adams.
[SPEAKER_18]: They were all standing on the people who
came before them and the collective body
[SPEAKER_18]: of of peer reviewed research dealing with
cannabis is now tremendous.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lifetime's worth of literature
out there on just about every aspect of
[SPEAKER_18]: the endocannabinoid signaling system.
[SPEAKER_18]: David, did I get it right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: On the, on the, on the plant, on genetics,
on, uh, every aspect of just about every
[SPEAKER_18]: type of medical conditions and how people
have sought to, you know, treat them,
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, with, with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we know they're anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that they promote apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_18]: We know that they inhibit tumor
angiogenesis, which is a very powerful
[SPEAKER_18]: mechanism for, um, basically stopping
cancer in its tracks.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think David, yeah, David,
you, you would, I think totally agree with
[SPEAKER_18]: me in this assessment is that cannabinoids
are, are, are more like the phyto
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabinoids in particular are more like
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get it right.
[SPEAKER_18]: One of these days I'll get it right.
[SPEAKER_16]: But so we're documenting history,
right?
[SPEAKER_16]: The true history.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's going to be a lot of
propaganda, false history about this and
[SPEAKER_16]: we got the true history.
[SPEAKER_18]: But the, the, the, the nourishment of
humans with the phyto cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope I said it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cannabinoids is, is nurturing a system
that in your body can suffer from what,
[SPEAKER_18]: um, people have termed endocannabinoid
deficiencies that our bodies.
[SPEAKER_16]: Say the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they had to alter it cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if, if our body is able to make its
own level of two H E and an atomized
[SPEAKER_18]: people don't need phyto cannabinoid
supplementation.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that basically what the theory says is
that endocannabinoid deficiency is why
[SPEAKER_18]: humans use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's a, it's a complex system.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not just a system of, of what
makes the cannabinoids is a system that
[SPEAKER_16]: transfers to camera cannabinoids and a
system that degrades the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_16]: after they've been used enough and you
don't want their use to continue working
[SPEAKER_16]: and you degrade the cannabinoids so they
don't stay around longterm.
[SPEAKER_16]: So here's something that happened to me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I fed my little Chihuahua a little bit of
a cookie, cannabis cookie, and he was out
[SPEAKER_16]: for three days.
[SPEAKER_16]: He couldn't walk, couldn't stand for three
days.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what I got from that is the system
that removes the cannabinoids in Chihuahua
[SPEAKER_16]: was wasn't as robust as the system in
humans.
[SPEAKER_16]: So different humans, different animals.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have different abilities to metabolize
cannabinoids once they're there.
[SPEAKER_18]: But David, isn't it also true?
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, so the fact that cannabinoid or
that the metabolic products of these are
[SPEAKER_18]: fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're stored in, in fat.
[SPEAKER_18]: And as you burn fat, that those compounds
are then released.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's sort of an evolutionary mechanism
to hold on to these beneficial compounds.
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as our bodies can, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So the fact that you can smoke a joint
today and still have so many nanograms of
[SPEAKER_18]: THC in your bloodstream next week,
that's actually something that our body
[SPEAKER_18]: has evolved to do, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Provide a constant level.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I think again, that's, that's what
sort of hampers the law enforcement aspect
[SPEAKER_18]: of being able to do a blood level alcohol
measurement.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, like they do with alcohol to say,
okay, you have so much THC in your blood.
[SPEAKER_18]: Therefore, regardless of how you behaved,
regardless of how you were able to pass a
[SPEAKER_18]: field sobriety test, this number from this
biological assay tells us that there's
[SPEAKER_18]: enough THC or 11 hydroxy THC or whatever
is in your blood to make you intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_16]: They want to change the reality.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not how dangerous you are.
[SPEAKER_16]: We got a number that says you're
automatically dangerous.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're not, they're not saying that
you're dangerous and you hit something.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're saying we got a number that says
we can put you in jail.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope in the future, one day people will
be like, back in the day, if you smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: this one flower, and drove a car,
you could go to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you grew the flower, you could
like, they could kick your door down,
[SPEAKER_05]: shoot your dog, take your kids and put you
in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope people are like, no,
that never happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: That couldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, in, in a free market economy,
when people make money off of those
[SPEAKER_18]: activities, they want things to stay as
good and fucked up so they can keep on
[SPEAKER_18]: making their money.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about people who, people who sell
breathalyzers.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a, the drug testing industry,
Marcus, is a billion dollar industry,
[SPEAKER_18]: billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't want people, our companies,
to not drug test their employees because
[SPEAKER_18]: they're trying to make sure that their
livelihood is derived from that revenue
[SPEAKER_18]: stream.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they don't want that revenue stream to
go away.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't they just test them?
[SPEAKER_18]: That company has got a big yacht in some
harbor somewhere and he needs to make sure
[SPEAKER_18]: that he keeps that yacht.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, yeah, there's a tip top shape.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a, I'm sure it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you also think about what
communities and civilizations of the past
[SPEAKER_13]: would have to say, if you told them what,
like what we did and no, no more hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: They would be like, you guys did what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like they would be so confused.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, at that point when it was in
everything, it was baskets, paint,
[SPEAKER_13]: like everything, people, sales,
people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you told them like,
oh yeah, that's not going to be allowed
[SPEAKER_13]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: They would be like, what?
[SPEAKER_18]: Laura, do you know back in William Penn's
colonial Pennsylvania, and you were a
[SPEAKER_18]: farmer, you were taxed if you did not grow
up.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_18]: You get taxed if you did not, because what
did her majesty, the queen of England need
[SPEAKER_18]: to conquer the world back in the day of,
you know, the British empire?
[SPEAKER_18]: She needed ships and what do you do?
[SPEAKER_18]: Ships across sails and ropes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sales and ropes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't have found the new world without
the, uh, without hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the only, only natural fiber that can
withstand seawater in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why they used it for ropes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the other thing is, and the Dutch,
cause who was building ships better than
[SPEAKER_05]: those motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_18]: As, as they mow, as they mowed down the
old growth, whenever they found a tree
[SPEAKER_18]: that was like straight for like 80 feet,
that was immediately cut down and sent to
[SPEAKER_18]: England or sent to the Netherlands to make
mats out of, because they needed long,
[SPEAKER_18]: strange or long straight, um, uh,
trees to make masts, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So another, listen, here's an important
thing to remember for people on the church
[SPEAKER_06]: discussion that was actual cannabis
sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So think of the timeframe.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like, you know, this is free.
[SPEAKER_06]: The use of and discovery really by the new
world of cannabis Indica, which is the
[SPEAKER_06]: drug THC producing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all that fiber back then was hemp,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's none of that was we're not what we
use today to describe sativa is,
[SPEAKER_06]: is an equatorial drug plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But cannabis, the, the word, the,
the name was given to the, to European
[SPEAKER_06]: hemp or Northern European hemp,
which is cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why like, you know, we went
through that period where we started
[SPEAKER_06]: calling it like narrow leaf hemp and broad
leaf hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really like, I think it's,
I think people using the word sativa say
[SPEAKER_06]: this, the word sativa means useful or
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's the Latin trans translation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And um, so yeah, we're really talking
about a fiber plant and a seed plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: not a drug plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we say sativa.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, another Dr. Alan Epiphany that I would
like to spread to these people is cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: and hemp are in fact money.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you legalize cannabis or hemp in
your state, money will come to your state
[SPEAKER_16]: in one of two fashions.
[SPEAKER_16]: If the people can grow cannabis and hemp,
they will get the money and they will
[SPEAKER_16]: spend the money inside the state and the
whole state will prosper.
[SPEAKER_16]: If the people are not allowed to grow
cannabis outside cannabis cartel
[SPEAKER_16]: companies, I'd like to call them carpet
bagger companies.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you guys understand what
that word means.
[SPEAKER_16]: Carpet bagger companies.
[SPEAKER_16]: So carpet baggers were the people from the
North that came to the South.
[SPEAKER_16]: After the civil war and they would extort
money from the South and they were called
[SPEAKER_16]: carpet baggers.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if the people can't grow carpet,
baggers will come to your state and they
[SPEAKER_16]: will extract the money from the state and
they will spend it outside the state.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can't argue with that statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Alan, I, I supplied the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name of the book and the full name and the
DOI of the, I forget the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wrote it.
[SPEAKER_18]: The driving study for Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in the chat, David, if you want to
see it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll definitely look that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I wanted to jump in on one other
quick little note.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about the pronunciation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabinoids are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I always thought it was
cannabinoids too, but the more I traveled
[SPEAKER_06]: and got involved with international,
um, like the, the neuroscience side,
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis, the researchers that,
that work in the field of discovering
[SPEAKER_06]: everything that's going on in the brain
and how, how the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_06]: works.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all use the term cannabinoid,
not cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, they'd be surprised when they find
out they were tricked by the society to
[SPEAKER_06]: call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that's not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no, that's not it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an American centric idea that,
that cannabis is pronounced that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other countries, other countries
pronounce it cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so it's, it is in the way that we
pronounce it in North America that makes
[SPEAKER_06]: us believe.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a victim of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tomato, tomato thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pronounced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How it's pronounced.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I just wanted to add to,
um, to the idea of the music artists by
[SPEAKER_13]: Caleb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Oh, Caleb too, when you were talking
about Jerry and that Vietnamese,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, hash, I'm actually smoking that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's actually been what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just put two and two together.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, Oh, I'm actually smoking
Jerry's hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I just realized that, but,
uh, it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's there's nothing left, but it was,
Oh, his, uh, Vietnamese, uh, land race
[SPEAKER_13]: strain that he has is, is really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, uh, I wanted to add to Caleb's music
artists.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this is changing the topic.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't want to forget is,
um, I really like the, this group out
[SPEAKER_13]: here, local to Mendocino called the Mendo
Dope Boys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they are a music group.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a rap music group, but they've
also been growing for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've definitely been reprimanded
many, many times been rated many,
[SPEAKER_13]: many times, but they're known really for
their big ass plants because here in,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, here in, uh, you know,
they were like, okay, well, we can't grow
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll just grow really fuck it big.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they were known for huge plants,
but they were one of the first music
[SPEAKER_13]: groups that I've ever seen personally.
[SPEAKER_13]: That, um, man, they took the biggest pot
you could find the biggest smart pot.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could find maybe 500 gallons,
but they planted one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_13]: genetics they have in their library.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they, they tamed it to go around a
platform that, that, that eventually
[SPEAKER_13]: housed their recording studio.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the plant became their recording studio
and they would step up into their cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: plant and record their album.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and they did it all for the recording
of their album.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, um, uh, oldie, he actually,
the lead singer, the lead of the group,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, and bleezy oldie and bleezy have a mic
stand.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the biggest cannabis stocks
and you'll see them on stage with a huge
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis stock, you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I think it would be really
interesting to get a perspective from,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, growers who are also, um, music
artists.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if both of them have ever
been.
[SPEAKER_05]: On hash church maybe once, but I've
definitely reached out to them in the last
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of months and been like,
gotta get you guys on be sweet to have you
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a good episode for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I could get quite a few artists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask this question earlier
and we only have about 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I'll ask it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to see what everyone's
favorite cannabis based song was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it'll be nice to, for the people
watching, they can kind of go check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, these different songs for me,
my all time favorite cannabis song is got
[SPEAKER_05]: it right here by Cisla.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if anyone's ever heard
that track, but check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cisla Kalunji.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would dub that tune.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to dub it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's such a good tune, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like such like just arms in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, this is such a tough tune.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we just don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we just don't care, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's uh, that sums it up quite
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_05]: The favorite cannabis tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke two joints before you smoke two
joints and then you smoke two joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the toys.
[SPEAKER_06]: The toys did the smoke two joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Billy Boyow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he uh, I'd have to go with like uh,
30 days in a hole or tool the pots or man.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just so many of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I always associate with Sam is um,
I've got five on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Caleb's got the list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Billy Boyow one spliff a day cause he did
that tune when he was like 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he cut that, that tune when he was
like 12 in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody feels like working when Panama red
is back in town.
[SPEAKER_18]: Panama red.
[SPEAKER_18]: You steal your woman, then I'll rob your
head.
[SPEAKER_18]: On his white coat, he comes strolling in
the town.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody feels like working when Panama red
is back in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, reefer man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, it was from the twenties,
but Murphy's law did it back in the
[SPEAKER_07]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I've, I've always, I come from
the punk hardcore side.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were the true stoners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over on that side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, I mean, but I mean back in
the nineties, when I used to go to all my
[SPEAKER_07]: dealers, you'd always hear, you know,
legalize it, you know, which was always,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you got to give it up for,
you know, Tosh, you know, for really
[SPEAKER_07]: putting it out there and laying it out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it took his own life in the end,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: By speaking truth to power.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he has always been an inspiration in
the music, even though it is mellow,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: His music's super good.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say Marlon Asher,
the ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's super classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Drip seven 10 just dropped that in
the, uh, info warrior jello by Afra grow
[SPEAKER_05]: more pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't snort the Coke.
[SPEAKER_18]: I only smoked the sense of media.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a, there's a super funny video on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_18]: Pato bantan bantan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's, here's a little note.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play in a band that,
uh, we were quite heavily into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, as I, as I always have been,
the name of the album was green fat and
[SPEAKER_06]: tasty.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually find that on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a song particular called the leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were, we were very, very pro
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a, I had a band too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number five back in 1991.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, we were growers as well
as dealers in West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, yeah, we wanted to just do
something that would call out to other
[SPEAKER_07]: stoners.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, we, we got that from high times,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, of course I would come to meet
and know and grow and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah, it was surprising how many
people knew what the band name,
[SPEAKER_07]: but then people were like, what does this
Aurora Borealis number five mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that five times the intensity of the
Borealis?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was just a fifth seat selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Props to that Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, the closet queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked that up in Holland back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of our first grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the mid nineties, 90,
95, I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys would know this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Who did the police and helicopter song?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, is that Ecomouse or I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, John Holt was the original.
[SPEAKER_09]: John Holt was the original.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Marlin was on Marlin did a version
of it, but, um, the original I believe was
[SPEAKER_09]: John Holt.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're definitely correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is history.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've run all, I run all of those.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have all the originals on seven inch
still.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody mentions Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe in church cause they're still
like busting out songs as we talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many good, everyone's got their
favorite.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a, I have a Garza tune like folder
for when I DJed cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think today there's probably 20,000
songs in that folder.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: All different genres, you know,
and started as just reggae donja tunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caleb, do you remember the name of the
song that I told you with that mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: haze and skunk?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll look it up right quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm afraid I'm so spaced out that,
uh, I honestly can't remember the name of
[SPEAKER_03]: the artists or the name of the song,
but it's a great one.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're getting all high on that oxygen.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Cheech and Chong did a song said my
mama and my papa try to tell me how to
[SPEAKER_16]: live, but I don't listen to them because
my head's is like a sieve.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_18]: no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit positive herbs.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Positive herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was an H N I Y O R A H.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to mispronounce it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a dub plate of that song too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Positive herbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you saying, Caitlin?
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Bob Dylan's everybody must get
stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, I can't believe I didn't say this,
but Puff Puff Pass by Prophecy,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I had on my channel for years and
years and years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prophecy is the homie in the left hand
side.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of kids singing that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in Cuba, I was paying the local
great band, the Cuban band.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cuban bands to play uh and uh they
wouldn't play it correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they would play was uh the cockroach
couldn't dance anymore because he's lost
[SPEAKER_03]: his uh vigor for revolution.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, that was the original cannabis song.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like who?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there was earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In India and places like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, this is history.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is this is history that's literally
sitting in Sam's closet in a box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there he does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even a closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an entire room and probably more but
there's something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendo dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Richie Spice dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

forth, I'm super stoked to just get good
[SPEAKER_05]: people into good conversations and
dialogues and I feel like every once in a
[SPEAKER_05]: while, we knock it out of the park and our
our words are important and they they mean
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff to other people that are watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's uh no better reason to do
something than that.
