[SPEAKER_01]: It's a competition wakeboard boat I know
chilling like a villain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think the only thing I can say in us
like an Australian accent if you say the
[SPEAKER_01]: name Jennifer Lopez It's the easiest name
to say in an Australian accent Jennifer
[SPEAKER_01]: Lopez Jennifer Lopez, that's my Australian
accent anyway, we've been through this
[SPEAKER_01]: before let's keep it up
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little angel holding a pot leaf,
you know Just standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit of a low low temp
Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna we're gonna boil that resin
up again
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the classic the classic shrimp on
the Bobby Not sure I pet mad it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a variety can't imagine Ron and I
grow in one thing, but I love the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling a Congo crop Has an Aussie I want
to crucify you mate I know it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize to all Australian people all
around the world I do love my Australian
[SPEAKER_01]: brethren and sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of them up in Whistler They
hold it down tons of Aussie people
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian people work on Whistler
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every year we have Australian Day and
it is quite an experience to party and
[SPEAKER_01]: rage with the with the Australians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't think that's true at all Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean some do for sure, but my buddy
Wally duck puffs the fire I got friends in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia like the mullin bimby mad nat
man in mullin bimby who grows the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: super exotic rare terpene profiles that
you have probably never even experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: so although yes, some people smoke out of
billabongs plastic shitty bongs It you're
[SPEAKER_01]: right fires everywhere but Australia is
very lucky they can grow Incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: quality herb on a massive scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very very powerful Sun and
Yeah, I know I fucking give my props up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia as this cannabis thing comes to
fruition I don't doubt that Australia will
[SPEAKER_01]: be a powerhouse in the cannabis world
They've got the they've got the Sun When's
[SPEAKER_01]: the last time you smoked a hash joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's probably on my video that got 1.3
million views the hash The hash joint
[SPEAKER_01]: video was the last time I smoked one
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that a good hash church yesterday,
I felt the same way about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like super stoked on it Cleaning out
this minor chas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Was very impressed with Peter Peter had
some great nights You know, he was very
[SPEAKER_01]: kind and compassionate and loving
individual and I was very glad that my
[SPEAKER_01]: hash church cohorts I didn't jump down his
throat because sometimes the hash church
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are a little bit harsh They'll be a
little you know, so it was good to have
[SPEAKER_01]: Indra in there who's very, you know
spiritual and I was very impressed with
[SPEAKER_01]: chimera chimera came and dropped,
you know chimeras like a scientist So he's
[SPEAKER_01]: also not always on point with the sort of
airy fairy sort of but he really liked
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter He loved his vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought that the information Here's the
bottom line about Peter Peter knew his
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, you know, he knew his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew his bacteria He knew his
information and that's what we love on
[SPEAKER_01]: hash church when someone can share
information with us I mean I learned a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: I can honestly tell you that I didn't know
most of what Peter was talking about and
[SPEAKER_01]: for me like a huge You know, I never call
us experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Didn't know Todd even had a new show to
be honest But that's awesome that he has a
[SPEAKER_01]: show and that he's doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that he's choked at me And he
doesn't want to do hash church anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of how it goes, right,
you know Start your own show.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can get lots of people You know,
he brought lots of great people on to hash
[SPEAKER_01]: church So I suspect what he would do is
maybe to make his own show and bring a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of great people Onto his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey the more the merrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that Todd continues to do his thing
I certainly don't have a dislike for Todd
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, he backed me into a corner
and tried to get me to You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he tried pulling a Bit of a power trip on
me and I absolutely will not be powered
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to hash church Todd is
always welcome on hash church,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yes hash church I do believe he quit
hash church recently and someone just said
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could comment on his new show So I
suspect he's moving on and forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what his channel is But if
you just Google Todd McCormick,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe his show will be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it will blow up Maybe he'll realize
hash churches church is something special
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just not that easy To bring
people together and run and and create a
[SPEAKER_01]: show I think at hash church is something
really special and I want to hold on to it
[SPEAKER_01]: and You know make sure that you guys have
oh He posted it in the hash church page.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see we'll see what's what's
going on there Anyway, I don't think I
[SPEAKER_01]: would probably want him to be advertising
in my hash church group For his new show
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys get me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like isn't That a bit of a
classless sort of Kind of maneuver so
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, I'm gonna have Peter back again
All right Saturdays at oh There we go He's
[SPEAKER_01]: got my whole Scott.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got let's see He's got Mel Frank Tom
Alexander son skunk man, Rob Clark cave
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome technologies and Todd McCormick
Hey looks like it'll be a great great
[SPEAKER_01]: great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to give him props, you know,
it'll probably Be a great show and I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be upset about it I want people to
have more access and honestly if his show
[SPEAKER_01]: became the show It would probably be a
huge relief to the hash church crew But
[SPEAKER_01]: hash church is special and it's not just
about inviting great people to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: Come together and so we'll see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's gonna be an interesting
year 2017 we got some Pretty good news
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna mention it yet, but it's
very exciting and We'll see what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: go if invited?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean probably like I said,
I'm not sure I don't want to get into a
[SPEAKER_01]: war with Todd Todd and I have very strong
egos very strong egos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Exactly drew bingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some negativity there that I
don't like to get into I've had it before
[SPEAKER_01]: with him and I'd prefer To not you know
get into it on that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So We'll see what happens All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I gotta get going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've We've done it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I can't get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta give some papers away I got my kid
knocking on my door, but I'm gonna hang
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna puff some bowls and It's the
greenhouse, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your relationship?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's becoming like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really listen I'll tell you know
what you guys want to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just put it right out there Todd Is
not a fan of oh, that's a bummer You guys
[SPEAKER_01]: got it sorry I bumped out there I went to
push something and someone sent me a
[SPEAKER_01]: message And it all changed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not a fan of Indra He finds Indra to
be not his favorite person and it got very
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable for me for him to try and so
what happened was when I invited Indra
[SPEAKER_01]: last time on to hash church Todd got very
upset and he said that he felt like I
[SPEAKER_01]: Blindsided him and I was like,
oh god.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would never I would never try to
offend you and I offended him So he I
[SPEAKER_01]: invited Indra on you know for me hash
church is bigger than Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bigger than Mark Richardson It's
bigger than Tony Verzura.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bigger Than any of us that are on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so when we're having a good
conversation and Indra fits into it I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to send him the link.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to send him the link people love
Indra They love his stories just because
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd thinks he's not a good person and he
thinks all these negative things It
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean that's what hash church
thinks and I tried to explain that to him
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got where he was coming From in the
sense of how he felt I blindsided him and
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that Todd I really didn't
try to blindside you but this is bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: than you it's bigger than me it's a it's a
thing that we have to kind of put our egos
[SPEAKER_01]: aside a little bit and I Learned my lesson
with her ratio our egos clashed so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both left, you know and never talked to
each other again and so I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that happen with other good long-term
activists and friends in the community So
[SPEAKER_01]: I will continue listen bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We slayed hash church this week It was an
unbelievable episode one of the best in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions and I'm gonna keep inviting
people like Peter and new people that you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't heard about because let's be
honest some of these older guys as awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: as they are and I always want them on the
panel You know, they they need the youth
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a nice mixture of the fresh and
the and the and the old With a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of us middle ground guys kind of what we
call we're called the new old guys Peter
[SPEAKER_01]: was the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He totally impressed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved his knowledge I felt great about
Alec from SC labs and we're just gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going we're just gonna keep inviting
great people in and we'll see what We can
[SPEAKER_01]: do with hash church episode 146 coming to
you soon in the meantime We need to give
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these papers away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's yeah said he was gonna be
coming back to hash church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely That's yeah fata Mike,
you know We got to inspire more shows more
[SPEAKER_01]: people doing the good things and we the
more the merrier because let's be honest
[SPEAKER_01]: if hash church falls to the wayside
Wouldn't it be nice to have a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: other shows that were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going and that you could get this
information from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just I think it would be really
really wonderful Oh me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt that Todd was one of the most
valuable Assets of hash church hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was huge asset to hash church,
but I can't let that You know you just
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're an asset doesn't mean that
you can start making rules for a show
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really just a show that you're you
know that you're a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, how's it going Tanner?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just live on the internet right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Buddy, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my little guy came to give me a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sad now So I'm gonna have to let you
guys go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I accidentally bummed him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very sensitive and Hash church will
never fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give these papers away to oh Let
me see let me see let me see let me see
[SPEAKER_01]: let me see I don't know who to give these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah tanner is a killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's such a good little dude He is such a
good little dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be a dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I did upset him by answering him
the way I did I I said it out loud So my
[SPEAKER_01]: wife could hear me so she could maybe come
and get him out of the room Which is all I
[SPEAKER_01]: ever require for the 20 minutes that I
film live each day and well almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: single day He's on that door knocking
trying to get in so it is what it is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the meantime rolling papers, I think I
think God it's almost easier to like say
[SPEAKER_01]: pick a number or something, but I don't
think we'll do that I think we'll yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: give it to Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send Todd up and give us some papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah He does smoke joints Would love a
bubble man memento.
