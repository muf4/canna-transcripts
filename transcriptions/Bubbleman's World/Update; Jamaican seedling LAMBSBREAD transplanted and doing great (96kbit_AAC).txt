[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
doing a little seedling Jamaican lamb's
[SPEAKER_00]: bread update for you So she's doing just
great She was planted at the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: time as the hash plants and you can see
the difference in growth On both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not nearly as strong or As
fast growing could mean that I have a male
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna complain happy with the male
I'll pollinate some strains that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll still get to try these genetics,
but Of course like every grower on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of wishing for a female I'm not a
breeder every breeder would wish for a
[SPEAKER_00]: male, but I'm wishing for a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway the update today She's ready to
get out of this little pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling her a she Absolutely So just
gonna give her a little bit of a moist
[SPEAKER_00]: moistening.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was pretty dry Let that soak in a
little bit And then we're gonna go right
[SPEAKER_00]: into this one gallon pot that I have I
don't have a ton of room right now for
[SPEAKER_00]: this But I am making room with it in under
my light until I get back and I can get my
[SPEAKER_00]: new tent going and whatnot I'll have much
more room for now One gallon for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: week of this little seedlings transplant
plant life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think that it'll be okay I've got the
one gallon three gallons in the five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots So I've got all the bases
covered All right a nice nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting system for a For a two-week old
clone seedling I should say Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we'll get that down nice and set Just
get our earth back in there our soilists I
[SPEAKER_01]: should say Just Yeah, this plant was
probably ready to transplant a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while ago and I didn't really really
realize it so I Was a little bit surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: at the health of the roots on the bottom
there Impressed with these genetics so far
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another thing that I did with this
one John was over and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that Jamaican seedling needs some
Sun man so he He got me to put it outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and I did I listened it wasn't too too old
But I thought you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Jamaican genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably so used to the hot hot Sun
and I'll tell you the minute I put this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing out Side it just it exploded and yes
to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did put the other ones outside as well
They just did not explode on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: level So there we go Our Jamaican lamb's
bread hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I don't believe it was a pure
pure Sativa I think that it had some cross
[SPEAKER_00]: in it with that organ strain that I've
mentioned The way there she blows guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: girls Jamaican lamb's bread Transplanted
So keep an eye out for this little girl or
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to be very documented
throughout her whole life Thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: watching. Peace
