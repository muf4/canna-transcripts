[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with Brett from West Coast
Concentrate and we are going to be doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: review today of the Vape X-Hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great little pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little brochure that tells you how to
use the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was pretty impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll photograph it in lay it into the
video so you can see the simplicity of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, step one turning on the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little red light goes on on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wait for, if you turn it up to a
certain temperature, you can wait for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn green and then that indicates that
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently it's pretty sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used the unit before so it is
quite funny that today both Brett and I
[SPEAKER_00]: who have never used this unit are going to
review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the title should really be the
review from the total new noob
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the accurate review of someone
that's used the unit for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months, learned all about the little
intricacies and sort of subtle nuances and
[SPEAKER_00]: mastered the sweet spot of tweaking it to
the point where, yes, this is how the unit
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're total noobs today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're total noobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought we would also nail it with
a terpene gauntlet so we weren't sure if
[SPEAKER_00]: we should do just pure terpenes which
could still happen or if we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing bubble hash with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see what happens as we come
along here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pamphlet's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely nice and clear and
precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It explains the whole unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit comes with a really, like dude,
tell me that's not a fatty, that's a fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: little piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it feels like it's like seven ml
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely, it's definitely probably
eight ml thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice pipe that just fits right on
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit itself takes these little nails
and I believe we should have one laying
[SPEAKER_00]: around right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you this cool little wooden
piece that fits five of these and I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: you got one that can be in the unit as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them in five packs like that
which they sent us a nice little five
[SPEAKER_00]: pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this little guy here you fill up
with your concentrate or your terp dab or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is you're going to be hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drop it into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the pipe on top and because we're
thinking of doing pure terp rips here for
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning, I think that's what we
should do now that I'm getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we should definitely keep this from
getting hot before we put the terps in
[SPEAKER_00]: because just from dropping that in for a
few seconds, it's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like quartz rod as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it dissipates its heat very well,
meaning that if you left it in there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty long time, you're still going to be
able to pull it out by the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a little ring on the top that
you could possibly, I guess, grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's totally doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this piece just doesn't get warm at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still on the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still, we're still heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that it takes a while,
the initial time to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly accurate unit in its
temperatures from what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, what are we starting with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to do pure terps,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do pure terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just start off with this guy
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll leave that one for dabbing and
we'll go in fresh for the terp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the big jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You afraid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're green too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what he said was as we drop it
in, we'll turn it down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will lower the temperature of the
heat that the unit's putting out and allow
[SPEAKER_01]: us to get, you know, all the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that go in or did that go out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, never leave your terp jar undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, when you have a nice vial,
sorry, dabber that you have terps in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's best to try and keep it from dripping
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you, let's see what we can do
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you the first one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cord is going to be absolutely
ridiculous for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to turn it down at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to turn it down as we
drop that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just turn it right down now to
one third and give yourself the freshest,
[SPEAKER_00]: fullest, straightest terp rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the tiniest little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard that the units are whistlers
when you don't put the water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a whistler.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that for taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I'm going to have to go for
one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too much of a punchy in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it done?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I just share yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want one of your own as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dissipated, dissipated, which is
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool down like incredible.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Jesus because, uh, well that was
extreme, extreme dropping right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at temperature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go up a little higher because
what Tony was suggesting was we go up to
[SPEAKER_00]: about the halfway point on the temperature
gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no markings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature starts at what I would say
is about seven o'clock and it goes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side to about five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half would probably be, you know,
between one and 12 and two somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got it up to half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going red right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what Tony said is get it up to
that little bit hotter and then just drop
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as you drop the nail in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the temperatures, uh, which makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat, the heat in the unit is getting
lower as you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have thought to start at a much
lower temperature and then lift it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Hey, Tony's been the one tweaking this
and playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I trust his judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see what he thinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, as you see a little slight vapor
build, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the airflow down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orangey or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's total triple OG in the back
end on my tongue and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the beginning, it was when you said
orangey, it was like rinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just shifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as I'm talking now, my entire mouth
is just completely satiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted on the lips as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different from dabbing it off of a
nail by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that that was very like almost
abrasive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a direct heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying earlier, definitely
is a little bit more harsher on the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you get more at, at a once,
um, but it's almost too much to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a nice little turp machine right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we'll go for a new nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were doing a new flavor,
we're going to hit the purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a total buzz off that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not smoked any hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke any hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke any hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke any hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge dab, but like a partial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turp a lot ready to drop in and go turps a
lot purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe the feeling I have from
that single.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different flavor than I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is really a unique unit in the
sense that it's going to be a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: abrasive than those nail hits for doing,
um, straight pure turp rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it's pretty, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: so pretty efficient in terms of clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor that you get overwhelming your
mouth and your palate is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm definitely going to go for one
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this cools down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way we did the cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a, that's a, that's a
winning situation right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually, I'm going to turn it back
up a bit at that temperature up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause remember we're turning it down,
getting it up and then we're turning it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess next time when we do it,
um, when I'm cooling this, just turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: back up to it's halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so far so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on our set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had your second dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going on my second now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's definitely a heady spacey,
almost like that's trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you only had one,
I know when you dab hash, after you made
[SPEAKER_01]: it through 12 of these, the modulation is
like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can put water in the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely surreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the cannabinoids are really
just these like nice friendly little
[SPEAKER_00]: things that just in, you know,
they, they're companions to the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One without the other is not a special by
no means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different for sure though,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, it's trippy different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your opinion, but for myself,
I'd almost rather the terpenes alone than
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoids alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, by no means do I need them
medicinally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them more so recreationally and
medicinally for my separated joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the terpenes seem to just help me
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't leave me in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just smelling them will, you know,
help me out more than a dabbing a little
[SPEAKER_01]: dab of hash would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the medicine cherry AK 47 time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became really apparent to me,
uh, as soon as you know, we had access to
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes that the THC and go all the
cannabinoids were less of a, less of a big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal than I thought they were,
you know, everybody wanting high THC
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm impressed with how buzzed I am off two
little terp reps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was trying to say.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice too, when you haven't smoked
hash in the morning, you're able to really
[SPEAKER_01]: tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, I smoked a lot of hash this
morning, so it could be that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had a Skype call that went for like
an hour and a half with skunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't even count how many bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real for certain myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I didn't smoke any this morning,
so it's nice to see the effects for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just waiting for this to get green
here.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a cherry AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on number three and we have three
more clean nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go through the next three,
um, which is the red Congolese,
[SPEAKER_00]: the long Valley Royal Kush and the AC DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do a quick cleaning of the
nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just torch them to make sure they're
totally clean and yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't get any aftertastes from the
past previous rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hitting the cherry AK 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying earlier, the cherry is
definitely like a nighttime, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go for a nap after this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't want to go for a nap
after this one, but it's a terpene that I
[SPEAKER_01]: use to, uh, to, to down my ash in the
floor bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just super hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're a variety,
it makes sense that they're hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's a little warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned it up for you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get this to cool off real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an oxidizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that second one go in.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like really, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get to take it right to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry AK for Mr. Bulb Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just turned it up cause you had it at
one third.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start at one half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go down to one third.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it went right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of fun little way to load it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the lightest vapor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just tastes completely and exactly
like AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the bud, the sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the one that tasted the most
like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they, they all have that very
strong gorilla glue is very much gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those cushions, but this is just,
yeah, it's bang on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely one of those units that
leaves you just kind of wanting to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting it until you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more even after that,
it's definitely a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: counterintuitive in that sense that even
as I 'm hitting it, like I could hear
[SPEAKER_00]: someone type, no, no, bubble man sucks
slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like inhale less and go slower cause you
don't want to cool the chamber down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure what kind of a chamber
they've got in here and how efficient it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it stayed exactly at
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you ready for the red Congolese?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely ready for the red Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most excited for the red Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, happy that you're, you're like
hitting these.
[SPEAKER_00]: First I'm excited and then passing it down
to me and I get to see it on your face and
[SPEAKER_00]: get to hear you from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much thanks to Tony for hooking up the
relationship with the vape exhale folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, much thanks to the vape
exhale folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, great unit, especially for
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't dabbed even hashing it yet,
but for terpenes, it seems to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more superior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than say, just dabbing it on your hot
nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a full drop of the red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to try and do this
time, I'm going to try and inhale slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, yeah, I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll be conscious of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're total noobs hitting
this thing for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in two months from now, we may very
well be hitting it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have had water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony, uh, urged me to leave the water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be much more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're milking it up real nice and tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that looks so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell the bunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see how you explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost celery-esque to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, but not celery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely got that undertone in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That vegetation taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm stoked to give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got a code.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a code for the people that want to
give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the good folks at Vapix Hale created a
code.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that it's stay melted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I should check just to make sure
because, uh, oh, it's stay Terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay Terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: S T A Y T E R P Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it across the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital S, capital T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you use that and you're going to get
50 bucks free vape nails when entering the
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously when you buy a unit,
uh, such as this, they're going to send
[SPEAKER_00]: you one free box of nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a $50 value.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you the access to,
to be able, if you are dabbing Terpy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, use five different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without having to clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I go for red congolese,
just like you hit it slow and easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it milking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say gentle is a, is a nice word to
describe your celery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as you exhale it, it turns from a
vegetation to a spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely peppery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that beta cariophylline in there,
but some other unique things that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see enough of, but it's,
it's probably that mercine, piney and
[SPEAKER_00]: deluminium combination sativa haze sort
of, uh, terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our palates would be a lot more used to it
if, you know, we weren't in a prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: based stage where everybody's growing
cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I left a little bit of a,
Oh, a little bit of a ring in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, a little golden ring.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, we have the Long Valley Royal Kush
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not going to cry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the most intense Kush smell that
I've smelled in a long time coming off a
[SPEAKER_00]: terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, yeah, that might be the
strongest Kush I've ever smelled in the
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's made some great ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to double you up, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we can get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just turning this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really enjoying this terp gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite different from the terp
gauntlet that, uh, D420K and I did with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one really felt like a, we gotta do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta, you know, we were like,
but this just feels like, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do like a hundred of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much of a, of a stony eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, yeah, it doesn't get you higher
and higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes like zoop, zoop, zoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're, you're changing the
direction of the, of the effects and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a damn beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely feel like you can do it all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been waiting for this unit
basically to do this sort of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: because I haven't heard of another unit
that exists that I could really pull this
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the quartz nails sliding into the
glass and that is just, uh, it cools down
[SPEAKER_01]: nice and quick too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can put our dad back into it and you
know, oh man, can I have a hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than waiting 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, I will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Valley Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely the way to hit it is
nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't cool the element.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting consistent heat the whole
time, which is allowing you to vaporize
[SPEAKER_01]: those, uh, terpenes efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that makes you come back for
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that cushy, cushy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gas on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mad gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mad gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely no turps left in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give that a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, uh, it's draining them good with
the, uh, temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I feel the temperature is
really a good temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not feeling that I'm getting any sort
of distasteful burnt popcorn, any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost at anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are just extremely subtle
that you could see in a normal session.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people wouldn't have the palette for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd say, well, it's not strong enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't give me enough of an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely see that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a connoisseur who's, you know,
super into different varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would definitely appreciate this
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not, not saying that anybody else
wouldn't, they just may not have the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, palette to understand why,
why the taste is so subtle and so complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the tiniest little, tiny little
drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was turps, but might
have to just, uh, wear those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was red Congolese for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a little bit nerve
wracking with the value of the turps and
[SPEAKER_00]: the drops and this, that, and the other
thing, but we're doing about what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: call quarter drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't $10, uh, us dollar drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching and you're freaking
out, um, they're more like $2 and 50
[SPEAKER_00]: cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would definitely say that is so well
worth the, like I would pay five,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 bucks to hit a dab of it, let alone,
Oh, nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, what again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was the, um, AC DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the real strong flavors and
tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're clean as a whistle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can smell it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, there's like no residual turps
smell on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like warm quartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that just smells
like warm quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't realize they were quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, but then when you see how
they're cut and you understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that it's like, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quartz is hard to work with for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeeze that little tiny mini almost
nothing drop out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like putting this unit on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mesmerizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just seeing a little bit of vapor that you
are creating, knowing how much flavor that
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of vapor is, is pulling them
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty phenomenal experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of unexplainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the AC DC by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this like flavor of herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get way, way back in the day
that just reminds me of like herb I puffed
[SPEAKER_00]: in high school that wasn't, wasn't the
kindest, wasn't the best flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but had a particular flavor that I just
would get time and time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got six down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush cleaner, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited about this Kush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely an overwhelming taste and
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you dab it with,
it seems like the Kush cleaner comes
[SPEAKER_01]: through over anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's definitely the boss when it comes to
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of mini, mini quarter drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit left in the dropper for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely the freshest like
cleaning supply one so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's phenomenal taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that lemon scented pledge in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely say lemons over oranges for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, uh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like, again, that's a pretty
strong smelling terpenes, but there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: really residual smell.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not waiting very long either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're noticing edits each time I grab
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait about a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just long enough that I wouldn't
want you to sit here and watch me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, blowing on it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a minute between each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for us cooling them down in
between terpenes as well as obviously to
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid it from just evaporating as soon as
you put it on a hot surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to go crazy on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so overpowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that hit is courageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have put a drop in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you're going to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the zest and the zing of the Jack
Frost for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that zest is lemon to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lemon zest, but then there's like,
there's this back end of the cleaner of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, of that Jack Herrera, of that like
strong spicy haziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super subtle, but it's right in
the undertones of the end of the rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can still taste the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first initial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take 10 more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one did we start with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we had, didn't we have one other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start in this little corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll hit a nice, a nice fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe how good that was,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like insane in the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I see the smallest amount of
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wipe down the beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beard oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beard oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beard oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going for some Covella.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covella is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.
Yeah.
Covella.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Hey, when you're doing a turp
gauntlet with your buddy, who's driven in
[SPEAKER_00]: from the city with 12 flavors of terpenes
and you've, this is the first time you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever used the vapic tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: God is that nice coming out of those two
little slits on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even really looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, $2.50 dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those quarter dabs are more than enough,
but I have to say when you do an
[SPEAKER_00]: accidental half drop or a full drop,
I don't think you'll be upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a really nice, enjoyable way to
enjoy, you know, not every dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a blue moon, which I think you've
gotten like three now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a great experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: An experience that I've not had before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done anything like this either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done all sorts of things with the
turps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a nice hit coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'll see the reaction as being
a super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really loved about that was it was
so smooth the whole way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavors really coming up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like really coming out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say complex, it's complex in the
sense that most palates don't recognize it
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could imagine my palate barely
recognized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as I'm talking, I'm getting the
full taste of a sour diesel coming out in
[SPEAKER_00]: my tongue and around my lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get such satiated turp rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way from running from that
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense that the code for the
discount would be stay turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for the longest while it was
about the melt, melt, melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it seems to have switched over a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now because we've achieved the melt,
it's a very nice compliment to add some
[SPEAKER_01]: pure cannabis to our turpies.
100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we are going for the AF GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: AF GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely happy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to taste it alone is what I'm
excited for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I haven't had that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just had it with honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a beautiful drop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you guys know, he just keeps giving me
bigger and bigger drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And myself as well included.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like we're kind of rounding
the bend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got only four flavors left,
including this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's on his fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got three left after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the Cali Orange OG Creamsicle
coming down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the Swiss Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to finish it with the Gorilla
Glue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different than I thought it was going to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had it with honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow factor I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: AF GUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just wanted to pull that guy out.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much finding that 90% of the
time when you go back for the second rip,
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing is so efficient that you might
be tasting the rip from being inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the water is not in there,
the turps aren't holding the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet if we put a tiny bit of water in
there, it would taste like the Jack in the
Box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the turps would hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be held in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good hint on that one, Tony,
for letting us know not to put the water
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as we've gotten through this
super quick, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these idiots.
Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're going to hit this AF
GUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting kind of used to the feel of this
machine, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a bit tippy at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not feeling that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making room for the extension cord changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it definitely did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not knocking the turps over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: AF GUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't grab me by the nuts,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little warm, or just that flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was like the different way of
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked for a few seconds while it was in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started hitting it, it was
already like evaporated in the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it was a little more like...
Less oxygen, more turps probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely, I might do the next one
like that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely does say in the pamphlet as
well, wait till the vapor starts emitting
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also not for pure turps,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's for cannabis, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure turps might be just whatever you
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're your turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're your, you know, this is a learning
experience, hitting turps like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, of course, there's going to
be people that are out there saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the safety precautions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to be inhaling these?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not promising you that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we're doing on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you feel the urge to try a bioassay
with it as well, by no means are we saying
[SPEAKER_00]: you should go out and huff terpenes 24-7,
and you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have confidence that we have been
inhaling these terpenes in profiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis and hashish for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hasn't caused us any problems as of
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what happens in the next 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years in the science of learning about
these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be certain ones we want to
omit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be ones we want to breed for
that are, you know, the strongest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: modulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what better way to learn when you
don't have a chemistry lab than to use
[SPEAKER_00]: your bioassay and test it out for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you definitely hit the nail on the
head there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no really better person to tell
you how you feel from something than
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science will come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't see any bad effects
coming from this just in terms of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been using them every day for a
while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure Boatman would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like the way they make me really
feel nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not nice in a way that's never again
replicated that you're searching out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're chasing the way a lot of different
drugs actually do to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that chasing of the sugar high or
chasing of the whatever kind of speed
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just find that it's similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always happy and uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that one strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was the Cali Orange OG
Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you turn it down or did you still?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did turn it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely turned it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burn nice and clean or evaporate it off
nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm digging the files.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say these these little these
little guys could be I'm sure Blue River
[SPEAKER_00]: could figure out a way to make quarter
drops available to just make it real easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to put them in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm a little nervous with my
dropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Orange Calio OG Creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one just dipped in there so
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop our tenth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for it to come through the little.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just see a little bit of a mushroom
cloud emit from the little quartz tube
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Orange Creamsicle on the start and
Calio at the end.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just completely blown away by the
quality of the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every different variety is a totally
different experience in terms of your
[SPEAKER_01]: taste buds which leads to a totally
different experience in terms of your
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swiss Tsunami is next on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your fave.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little droppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple more flavors left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss Tsunami and the Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the CBD flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always find when I give them to someone
as well, they'll be like, oh, what was
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter which one it is, if it's a CBD
strain, one of these ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered high CBD, I would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am definitely more on lines with what
Chimera said on Hash Church a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago which is I look forward to the day
that we call these things what the
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents are that make them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile and the cannabinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more than a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a lot more to the end user than,
hey, this orange creamsicle is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one I just hit was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say almost the longer you let it emit
out, the more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of what I noticed on that one as well
that I did like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's coming right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely one of the more enjoyable ones
there too, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that's, I mean, almost hard to
describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jack Frost-esque but not as zingy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't linger as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't linger as long, but it's
definitely got, or maybe it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a more subtle, less like,
you know, because it's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's overpowering at first and then
just dissipates next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lingerers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, of course, a movie that we are
calling out right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think you know the name of the
movie that that little scene was from
[SPEAKER_00]: where Buddy says to his buddy,
Lingerers, type it in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if someone already typed it in,
I want to see how many of you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: movie reference that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a stoner movie or a
cannabis enthusiast movie if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the term stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to our last one, bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm feeling pretty modulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use the word stoned,
but I'm definitely feeling something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a good little vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just holding a vibe down with 12
flavors, 12 cultivars of terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: here from Blue River Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, of course, the Canadian
distributors for the Blue River Extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're looking for Blue River
Extracts, you can send an email to
[SPEAKER_00]: thewestcoastmelt at gmail.com because
many, many people are going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: where can I get those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can I get those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, VapeXHale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can pick those up at vapexhale
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys have, they have their shit
together pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a pretty great customer
service going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just all around, they want to make it
easy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the code STAYTERPY, S-T-A-Y-T-E-R-P-Y,
and you'll get yourself a nice $50 value
[SPEAKER_00]: of these nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's nice to have extra nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a necessity if you're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having droppers for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could mix them all up, but it's not as
enjoyable of an experience in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you're paying for them, so you want
to be able to use them as efficiently as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you something that I've never
had the experience of that Darren and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even have in our terpene gauntlet,
and I guarantee you it has a lot to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the water and the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these, I got to taste it
unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not taste a single rip of one of
these, particularly where we went from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, the Long Valley Kush from the Red
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very different tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never tasted one after the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, too, less of a lingerer in
the water, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just delivers that profile that you
put it in the courts every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no smell to it other than warm
courts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that leads us to believe there's no
terpenes left in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty cool aspect of the unit,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to have a little terpene
party with your friends and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: half a dozen to 12 flavors, this is
definitely a nice option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still, for sure, the minute we're done
this, I'm going to want to do some terp
[SPEAKER_00]: nipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, nothing wrong with
taking a freshie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one, so it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went for like a damn near full drop,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that emit first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocking that full drop of the Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, let it emit, he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting how the other one pushed up
harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenal hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely one of the bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dial was turned down substantially,
so it was actually at a much lower temp
[SPEAKER_00]: than I normally have hit the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 12 cultivars of terpenes in
their purest form profiles, terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not single terpenes in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give that like an 8.5 out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely, yeah, great experience,
great unit, great terpenes, great company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I give it a 9 out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bumping mine up to a 9 out of 10 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've told you where you guys can hook up
with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that you enjoyed the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably going to go off camera now
and hit many, many terp dab modulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those phytocannabinoids in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the West Coast mounts right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fat lady has some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for inviting me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just thought we would throw in,
at the end of this gauntlet, a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs to show you what it's like to
actually do a terp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hit a little of the West
Coast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some beautiful Green Crack Gaud
73 and some Green Crack Gaud 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got such a nice profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying it out of the VAPEX ale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try it out of the VAPEX
ale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn it up a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to go big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely get that impression that it's
super efficient machine, so you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to go and drop a big glob on it by no
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to dip into the Red
Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice little terp dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you've seen, what I've done is I've
made a clear vial with one drop next to
[SPEAKER_00]: all my 10 drop vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the vials that I prefer to dip
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to dip into a full 10
drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're down to the last couple of
drops, we understand that you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is, just a tiny little dab in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to have to go much
higher on our temperatures than just
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting for it to get green here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll have a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to try putting some water in
the bong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if we did this correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this little guy loaded with a
bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just the top piece and then
the bottom doesn't chug at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want the water to go in and
leak into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bubble dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's going to be quite an
enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't look like it wouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a lot out of that little dab too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny little bit hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a little too hot, but
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our first dab all day too for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: To load it into a nail and hit it through
a pipe, it's taking away the...
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely taking away the scooping
out and then dropping a glob and seeing it
[SPEAKER_01]: all bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really just kind of naive to what's
going on in the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to try it at a lower temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try it at a lower temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like it gave off a little bit
more than say like a nail would.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's enclosed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been something that you and
I would adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to split that one and it was still
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you like to turp dip into for
this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do... You pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go for the cush cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I let him pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured if I'm going to pick for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I might as well pick something
that we're going to fiend over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking like we thought that we were
hitting the turps on such a low temp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's almost like I think we should try
hitting the hash on that low temp as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit lower anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had it turned up substantially
more, although it gave a cloudy,
[SPEAKER_00]: rippy, super cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a drink of water before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear my palate as it went green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming up the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is ready to rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can smell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty surprised at how much it's
ripping for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I smoke hash all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's twice as much in there this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grab a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, does that smell good?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite ones so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: That combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kush cleaner is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: As if you're getting 40 rips from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we showed them what it was like
with the hash because we're doing just
[SPEAKER_00]: pure turpedit rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: People might not have realized that this
thing is a champion if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually take serious fucking hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did by no means put like a quarter of a
gram dab in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a .1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe .2.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's done though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this little wooden guy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to give a big thumbs up to
the Vapix Hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really, really glad that we threw some
bubble hash in there from the West Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbed it up, turped it up with a couple
of nice flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kush cleaner being like an all-time
new favorite up there with the Master
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout Jack Frost combo.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need any more information about
this video?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it down in the comment sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks for watching Bubble
Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Bye.
Bye.
