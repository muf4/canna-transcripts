[SPEAKER_13]: Episode 9, and I've already got a few
folks in the house.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, hemp guy?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to figure out why my camera's
not on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Soma's figured his out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hayate Matsuzake!
[SPEAKER_11]: I got help.
[SPEAKER_11]: I needed help.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And nice to see you, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Little hash church in the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Debbie's here with the Golden Gate
Bridge behind her.
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing, Debbie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or should I say Deborah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it says?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it does indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no idea how to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can rock, Deborah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm bubble man Marcus Richardson,
so I've got three silly names here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got my Japanese friend's name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: His laptop right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Matsuzake.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, welcome, Hayate.
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on, everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, great to see you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morning, skunk man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morning, Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morning, Deborah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a while since we've had a hash
church, you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been so much going on in the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and Soma's going to melt some hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the first time I saw Soma do
that was probably a very, very long time
[SPEAKER_13]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 2001 or 2002.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm telling you, dude, because I picture
that Jason Lee bubbler that you bought
[SPEAKER_13]: from me in the background as you're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it right near where I am now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, lots going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it would be a kind of a good
idea to have a little gathering of hash
[SPEAKER_13]: church alumni here, maybe some new,
maybe some old and just kind of get
[SPEAKER_13]: together, not with any really particular
narrative to discuss or script,
[SPEAKER_13]: but really just, you know, get together
with all of you guys, find out what's
[SPEAKER_13]: going on in your neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_13]: With all the, I mean, full blown madness,
you know, I'm trying, I want to try and
[SPEAKER_13]: keep it positive, but at the same time,
I want to hear exactly what everyone's
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of going through these days in
regards to all the madness.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of madness going out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to check out London and
Germany and Berlin?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I saw that one in London.
[SPEAKER_13]: How many people was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as many as in Germany.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see Germany, but I saw London and
looked like Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just put some pictures up on my
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Germany was outrageous, you know?
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I thought the picture of London was
pretty outrageous.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Germany really must've been outrageous.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked like over a hundred thousand
people in London.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and over a million in Germany.
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, people are out protesting and here
we are just puffing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a couple hundred people watching
in the room right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Puffing is one of the best things you can
do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, obviously we're all quite biased
and we've been saying this for a long
[SPEAKER_13]: time, but when you hear mainstream media
people, when you, when you hear Dr. Bonnie
[SPEAKER_13]: Hendrie, who's our health lady here in BC
say, you know, just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: stay at home with friends and smoke some
joints.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did she just say to hang out with friends
and smoke joints?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did she say smoke joints?
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: She was talking about like puffing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's, you know, we're allowed to
smoke joints now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So why not?
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, it's at the point right now
that every time I go out and I roll a
[SPEAKER_05]: joint, I actually, I got like four or five
in front of me soon as when I light up a
[SPEAKER_05]: joint with some friends, I just hand them
one now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's, you just can't share anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's like that puff and pass is roll
one for your friend.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's the Jamaican way,
to be honest, the Jamaicans taught me that
[SPEAKER_13]: so many years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were just like, well, why do you want
to pass your joint around?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, why don't you just roll your own
spliff?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, man, I never even thought
of such a thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And same reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, you know, why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we always want to share something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like here, you let up a joint first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to do is such a big part of it,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think the bigger reason was in
America, a joint used to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's, I mean, in Jamaica, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why share?
[SPEAKER_03]: I recognize that voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_13]: You recognize that voice.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a, that's the skunk man Sam in the
house.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome Colin, Colin Paul.
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at, look at Mark Scaldone.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a, that was a pretty fancy shot
you had there, bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we call, that's what we call
the money shot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not scared of the investors out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_13]: The money shot.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how's everybody been doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, what's been going on in the
world of all of you, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: what's, what's, I can honestly say that
absolutely nothing has changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: In my life.
[SPEAKER_10]: I stay at home.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never go see anybody and everything's
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never go see anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't lose any cars.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was socially isolated.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was socially isolated.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got to expand on that one,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: That, that shit is funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, not now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drive it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Sam's a big enough man to
acknowledge that that shit happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was classic.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It never ever happened to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's just, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is the story that sort of leads
into, um, Oh, what the heck is his name
[SPEAKER_13]: now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Karma.
[SPEAKER_13]: Karma genetics has a cultivar called,
where is my bike?
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone's like, what the fuck is
that?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, it was the amnesia haze crossed
with that biker push.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was like, I think one of the first
guys to ever smoke it basically came back
[SPEAKER_13]: and was like, I lost my bike, which is not
really the most, like lots of people have
[SPEAKER_13]: lost their bikes in Amsterdam,
particularly people who go there,
[SPEAKER_13]: who rent a bike and have never been there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the place all looks the same.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you park your bike out in front of a
little spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the next thing you know, you're
walking around, you get separated from
[SPEAKER_13]: your bike.
[SPEAKER_13]: That bike's gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you never ever do this, especially if
you don't walk it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no doubt about that, but doing it
with a car is like the next, like the next
[SPEAKER_13]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always lost my car.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no one even got a new car out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some Omasita says someone got a new car
out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Without even knowing the story.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm loading up some, uh, lime juice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm popping 87, a little bit of rosin that
I squished with Flav the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else using tons of edibles during
this whole COVID thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been, I've been doing edibles almost
every other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the sauna and I ate a bunch of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got in the hot tub.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a few sweats on the edibles and my,
I'm not on my phone when I'm in the sauna
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not talking that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mostly like internalizing and it was
fantastic eating edibles at the sauna.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been just popping a lot, not so much
eating edibles, mainly because I'm working
[SPEAKER_13]: in the lab five days a week.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can't just get utterly destroyed and,
and still operate multiple lab technicians
[SPEAKER_13]: and multiple modalities of extraction and
all highly regulated QA and all this other
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff that you have to sort of deal with.
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, puffing has certainly been my
friend.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's probably why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can, do you guys hear my shop
got looted and robbed and closed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible, horrible, horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually see it in your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that disappointment in your face and
usually, usually, usually I never see that
[SPEAKER_03]: in your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your face is like optimistic, like,
you know, inspiring and it still is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but now I know that look.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it in your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened to you and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, maybe that's why I'm eating the
edibles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got to like shut down that thought
process that happens, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when something really bad like that trauma
from it, you know, because it was bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys all, all 10 dispensaries in
Oakland got targeted by looters and
[SPEAKER_00]: robbers, like every one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the majority of us lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our security cameras, our doors,
our windows are all of our weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our money, all of our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, because the Oakland police
department, I don't blame the robbers per
[SPEAKER_00]: se.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame societal issues, of course,
being so bad, but also the Oakland police
[SPEAKER_00]: department didn't help us at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually left our place unguarded for
eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys were able to get a thousand
pounds safe out of there in that course of
[SPEAKER_00]: that eight hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's some bullshit for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember back in the day when someone
drove a car through the front of the
[SPEAKER_13]: compassion club, which would actually
later end up leading to me getting busted
[SPEAKER_13]: with compassion club cannabis because they
didn't want to keep it at the facility
[SPEAKER_13]: because they were getting robbed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, these guys drive a car through the
facet, right through the window.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is in the nineties, late nineties.
[SPEAKER_13]: They get this, the safe had to be close to
a thousand pounds as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was ridiculous how far they moved it,
scraped up the floor, bent the door.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was just somehow cracked the tiniest
bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it had like 35 pounds of Renee in
the safe.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this little crack was like,
you might as well have had a thousand
[SPEAKER_13]: light grow in full bloom inside that safe.
[SPEAKER_13]: It stunk so bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: The cops showed up and Hillary was certain
like, Oh, this is not going to go well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they guarded that safe for like hours,
just standing next to the safe,
[SPEAKER_13]: not doing much.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like they were standing there
with their guns out.
[SPEAKER_13]: They just were a presence.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, how hard is that for the
police?
[SPEAKER_13]: Police department to be doing,
I mean, in my opinion, I would be probably
[SPEAKER_13]: one of the safest places to be still hang
out next to the safe.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you got your cop car there.
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's going to come and bother you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really sorry that happened to you and
all the rest of the millions and millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends lost $2 million,
like so above, you know, millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in their facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, the police felt so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have stepped up a little bit,
at least to be preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the weirder conversations I've
ever had with the police, which I've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot at the point, but yeah, the captain of
the police department's like, how about
[SPEAKER_00]: next time, we'll guard it, just bring it
all down to the police department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll sort it at the police department
during the civil unrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are like, Oh my God,
is this really happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: The police tell me to bring my weed down
so they'll put it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the police always said crime
doesn't pay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's their motto.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why people don't trust them.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, man, like even your motto's way
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're not going to smoke a spliff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you better smoke one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam, when's the last time you smoked a
spliff, Sam?
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I had either women or slaves
at my house.
[SPEAKER_13]: He went there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Only Sam.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to know the context of that
without thinking Sam's a total douche,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, and I can promise you he's not,
but that was borderline over the,
[SPEAKER_13]: over the, over the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't smoked a joint in 19 years
myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: You haven't.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_20]: I smoked a joint last night.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_20]: Wedding cake, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was delicious actually.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish, I wish I could, I don't know why I
can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know, it has to be great
weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it has to be great weed for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: But something happened so much after I got
turned on to bubble and I was making
[SPEAKER_13]: bubble in 99.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was getting Renee and it was so
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_13]: It almost blasted out my, my nose and my
taste buds with this Renee profile.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for two and a half years, I smoked
that shit chronic every day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then someone was like, Hey,
like, uh, this is a really, it was a super
[SPEAKER_13]: nice joint in Jamaica of like lamb's
bread.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, you got to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just took a little, little puff of
it and it just tasted like, like an
[SPEAKER_13]: ashtray.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just like, it was wet on the end
and it was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I was like, I've ruined joints for
myself, which was really actually quite a
[SPEAKER_13]: sad day.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't stoked about it at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like, I couldn't get back to the
perspective because I like many of you
[SPEAKER_13]: absolutely loved joints.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I would look at it the way Soma's
looking at his.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was only like 20 something or 15
years in or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: like I wasn't 50.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I could go back and enjoy it,
but I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the commercial market, but it's
nowhere, you know, can't get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to, I know Marcus is trying to.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say that some of the newer stuff
I've been smoking on these, these really
[SPEAKER_20]: expansive poly hybrids that have just been
super worked.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean the terpene profiles on some of
them are really.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love them in, in, in pure form,
diluted on plant matter and wrapped in
[SPEAKER_13]: paper and glue.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll met you on that.
[SPEAKER_20]: But last night was, was interesting.
[SPEAKER_20]: I, I, as you know, I'm not huge on joints
at all.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, yeah, I mean, I didn't smoke the
whole thing, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: definitely, definitely got to know it.
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's everybody, what's everybody
smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you guys, Soma, what are you
smoking on out in Amsterdam, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is like five different kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always call it Soma salad because almost
every time, unless I'm testing something
[SPEAKER_03]: out, I'm always making a mix because
that's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my favorite kind of split.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're working on that.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're really enjoying lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got this amazing labnesia going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terpenes are very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: They must be super funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nice growth patterns, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the sounds of that, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: You picked two pretty darn good ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, listen, I love that haze,
that narrow leaf drug cultivar terpene
[SPEAKER_13]: profile that is just, you know,
we, you know, in North America,
[SPEAKER_13]: we call it exotic.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's those exotic, exotic flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when it's the Southeast Asian
one, it's super exotic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, I mean, shit, I remember you
breaking up that 26 week sativa at,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think David's from Ripper Seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were making hash there and you were in
the back room in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was, it's funny because there's
a video of that on my channel.
[SPEAKER_13]: All these different stories often that I
talk about, I'll be like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's actually a video of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: On this, on this YouTube channel,
it's pretty trippy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have the video of the experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: 26 week haze was the longest I'd ever
heard flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to grow one back in the day that
was about 16 weeks that we thought was
[SPEAKER_13]: long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even that's long these days.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's long, but that 26 weeker that you had
was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be available too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one that went till under natural
photo period in the central coast of
[SPEAKER_10]: California.
[SPEAKER_10]: It went until April the 1st and I called
it April Fool's Haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was planted, you know, like in
September or something like that,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it just took forever to flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a plant that I'm running right now,
so I'm in like weeks to fix the flower and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just starting to get buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, this one's going to go probably
that 16 weeks because it is a Colombian,
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 weeks of Piva Colombian with a Grosko
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, you can tell us like,
Oh, it's going to go that long.
[SPEAKER_10]: What photo period do you put it on,
Jarny?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I'm on 11 and a half hours a day
because I'm trying to match my PPFD to get
[SPEAKER_05]: the right moles a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got 30 moles a day at 756 PPFD at
my camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a major pH problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was heating up 4.5, so I'm trying to
come up with something fast at my camp for
[SPEAKER_05]: like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your pH was that low for two weeks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was light stress in the
beginning and it was light stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was hitting them at like 1,500 PPFD,
1256 to 1,500 at 18 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I went into flower, things
changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started seeing light stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then through that, my meter started
failing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went into PPM to a nutrient lockout to,
well, at least the team is now better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're recovering.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other ones probably won't,
but I'm actually being able to see longer
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll recover from them and be
able to see what I get from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the photo period right now,
we think, sounds 11.5 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I'm at 750 PPFD at the top of
the camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that gives me 30 moles a day,
I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you can usually speed up flowering
or shorten flowering, depending on what
[SPEAKER_10]: you want to call it, by not doing 1212,
but doing 11 hours of light a day or
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also introducing the plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like how Johnny B went deep on that
answer.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much were you expecting Johnny B to
answer like that, skunk man Sam?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Johnny B tried to be Mr. Science.
[SPEAKER_13]: He did a pretty good job on that light
answer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to give him a little high
five there.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's carnificating, you know, what he
knows about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I like that about Johnny B that he
goes deep and he's like, he gets into shit
[SPEAKER_13]: and he's like, Hey, I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_13]: He never tries to act like he's the big
expert, but he's like, he's got great
[SPEAKER_13]: information and he's learning it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's here to share it with us.
[SPEAKER_13]: So fucking thanks, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to share it with people in
that pH low.
[SPEAKER_05]: 4.5, like really showing people because it
looked like it was nutrient burn and I
[SPEAKER_05]: thought it was a nitrogen burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I thought it was light stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was so many.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm testing my meters like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually with the blue lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one guy I brought in,
he goes, your meter's eight years old,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, only good for two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your meter's dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, why doesn't stuff last
forever these days?
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was his lesson for me was,
it was really, I have three, not double,
[SPEAKER_05]: triple checking my calibration.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually not comparing with another
pen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So having two is, is now I'll always have
a second pen to double check with things
[SPEAKER_05]: because I relied on one meter for so long.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I appreciate your honesty,
your transparency and your courage in a
[SPEAKER_13]: time when so many people are so afraid to
show any vulnerability or weakness on
[SPEAKER_13]: social media.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you are just blasting it out to the
world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I fucking got bugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I fucked up my plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what you're doing is, you're making
the mistakes that they're all afraid to
[SPEAKER_13]: either talk about or share or show.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're doing it in a way that are
allowing people to be like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe that's what happened to my plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, cause people are, the internet
is horrendous.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, uh, it's, you know,
you, you go on there and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_13]: you're under full attack.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if you just posted, if it wasn't you
posting that picture and it was anyone
[SPEAKER_13]: else, you know, they would just be like
fully destroyed on social media.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at this new, like people are not as
willing to help.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do really appreciate your ability to
share your mistakes with everyone and get
[SPEAKER_13]: past them and show how you can continue to
grow healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, it's the plant that always
teaches me to grow forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and it's showing me, uh, like I had
that amazing canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The root was doing so well and I was so
proud of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, it is kind of like at
any second you can, that's how quick you
[SPEAKER_05]: can lose a crop and people really,
I mean, I I've never had this problem
[SPEAKER_05]: before and it went through everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good to be able to share with
people at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are teaching me so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I'm sharing, I'm learning so much
coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause now everybody's like, go try this
and your pH gotta be 6.6.
[SPEAKER_05]: These, the lights are more like Ferraris.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to tune up your
engine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to need to add a little bit
more of this and change your, like there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a few different things that I'm learning
going into this new phase of the next
[SPEAKER_05]: level growing with VPD, with LEDs,
with looking at those canopies,
[SPEAKER_05]: but looking at the PPFD, look at the
amount of moles the plants are getting a
[SPEAKER_05]: day and really dialing that in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like right now I'm learning that with
LEDs, like I can come in at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: last couple of weeks of my flowering,
add a far red, the plants feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: they're in the shade.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to actually just elongate
more and get bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the research that's coming
out of, uh, AppleD technologies,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is Bruce Grimsby from, and this is
all NASA research right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty cool to see how the
direction with LED growing, cause I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been growing with LEDs for so long to see
it gets next step in the future of
[SPEAKER_05]: growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always say in this green rush right
now is LED lights for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the biggest green rush right now
for the industry is LED lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there's so many lights on the market
now, before you just go buy an HPS bulb or
[SPEAKER_05]: a dual line gamete.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many LED lights on the market
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's, it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_05]: What light to choose?
[SPEAKER_05]: What light not to choose?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which ones work for what application?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got ones for veg, ones for flower,
ones for lake flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's pretty cool to see how we're
able to dial this in now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been down the rabbit hole,
huge learning about PPF, the full
[SPEAKER_05]: synthetic flux density and the amount of
photons are leaving the light source and
[SPEAKER_05]: the amount of X hitting the leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's just so much more to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I always love sharing this with
you guys because I kind of want you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: to share back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hit me up and let's talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I love so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bong rep, I have to say, dabs away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bong rep, indeed.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was, uh, that was awesome,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm, uh, I'm always stoked.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was stoked when you got into the,
the, the act of water that was unique and
[SPEAKER_13]: different.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a lot of people were doing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course tons of people are,
are, are light experts and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_13]: but you're, you're honest and trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's like your, your,
how you differ from a lot of these
[SPEAKER_13]: different people.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're actually trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not out to direct people in the
wrong, in the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So cheers, Johnny B and cheers everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_13]: On the panel right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate you all showing up
here today for a little Hash Church,
[SPEAKER_13]: something we haven't really done in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, me and Colin have a project we're
working on together.
[SPEAKER_00]: After meeting on Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, um, well, you guys know that
Magnolia has a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and there I was dabbing probably last
time I was on the Hash Church and COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: was just heating up and I'm looking at the
rig going, and I think we even talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we clean those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can use them in a public space
and I could use it and then it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned and somebody else can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do you actually flip the
glassware in a, in a commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: setting in a dab bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we had our panel discussion here,
everyone was like, uh, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we couldn't really come up with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and Colin formed a little committee
and have been working for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, Colin, do you want to
tell them about the SOPs at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Colin developed the SOPs and now we
need some other people to peer in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do peer review.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's been super fun.
[SPEAKER_20]: We just kind of been meeting, um,
once a week after hours, just,
[SPEAKER_20]: um, chatting about the need for clean
utensils in a, in a social setting that
[SPEAKER_20]: could be used at time and time again and
how those things are turned over and what
[SPEAKER_20]: that means in terms of, of disinfecting
things and how to keep that, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: really clean for the, for the user.
[SPEAKER_20]: So they feel safe and they feel,
they can say, you know, a place that they
[SPEAKER_20]: can go to, to really use their medicine.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've just, you know, we put together
some guidelines and kind of a,
[SPEAKER_20]: an overview that we're working through
right now.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we'd like to pass it around to
other, you know, other people on the panel
[SPEAKER_20]: or just other people in our community to
get feedback.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can develop this to a set policy.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can help shape that moving forward
post COVID and how people could use that
[SPEAKER_20]: to inform their businesses and a lot of
[SPEAKER_20]: other things as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, when you say, I think we've,
we've got a good framework together and I
[SPEAKER_20]: think we, you know, we have, uh,
you know, we've got a good set of people
[SPEAKER_20]: that are, that are on the panel right now.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think, you know, as Deb was saying,
I think we, we'd love to, to have
[SPEAKER_20]: everybody's thoughts and ideas,
you know, kind of circulate into this
[SPEAKER_20]: document.
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's actually multi-step,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start with the clean surface to
clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to clean the goop off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to, uh, sanitize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to disinfect it and,
you know, then you got to keep it safe in
[SPEAKER_00]: between use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, our hope is to, um, post COVID
not have the government come and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to get COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can just step in and be like,
well, we came up, we took months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a big survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We peer reviewed them through a bunch of
scientists and experts and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's been pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really cool guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, uh, want to take this chance to
welcome, uh, Josh and Kelly, who I saw
[SPEAKER_13]: just come, come into the room and a little
bit ago, dragonfly earth medicine in the
[SPEAKER_13]: house.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, also wanted to welcome Valerie Corral
who's in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see her picture up and, uh, Peter,
Peter from soil balance pros back to work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, and she's a great person to visit with
us.
[SPEAKER_13]: So welcome all of you guys, uh,
to hash church today here on Sunday
[SPEAKER_13]: morning, at least where I am.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Valerie.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, uh, it was so good to hear you speak
the last time you were on with,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, Josh and Kelly, they did, they were
doing the DEM pure series and you ended up
[SPEAKER_13]: on there, I believe.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was, uh, it was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I even learned some new stuff about you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought you spoke so authentic and
so from the heart.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was totally like hair standing up
on my arms the whole time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the back of my neck, I was like,
damn, like I remember how amazing you
[SPEAKER_13]: were, but then I was reminded by how
amazing you are.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, yeah, really welcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty inspired group here, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's easy to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Being with a, with a damn pure is pretty,
uh, damn pure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, we had a, had a really nice
communication with all the communications
[SPEAKER_14]: leading up to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a ton of work that's going into
this, uh, process.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Josh and Kelly and just the immensity
of the, well, really that everyone's doing
[SPEAKER_14]: right now because we're trying to,
uh, rise up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So to speak with the limitations that we
are all facing and the challenges and
[SPEAKER_14]: still with the deep connection to one
another.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it makes it a great opportunity,
but, um, challenging.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just really appreciate these
opportunities to chat with, with my
[SPEAKER_14]: comrades and inspired folks here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Valerie, did the fires bring any
problems to you, to your collective?
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we thought that our North County
fire burned from the mapping, but it turns
[SPEAKER_14]: out that third fire in Santa Cruz in the
last almost 50 years, and it did not,
[SPEAKER_14]: it did not burn.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got in sneaking in and they have to do,
you have to do it, get around the,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, you have to put those plants need
water.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really scorched and hot,
but.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's safe passage, safe road in behind,
you know, through properties.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, you know, another good,
it's good fortune just again.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's tragedy if you,
um, it's tragedy if you're in the way,
[SPEAKER_14]: but nature does this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, kind of, uh, I was reading
that, um, quote by, uh, Dr. Martin Luther
[SPEAKER_14]: King.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, uh, riots.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are the protests of the unheard and w you
know, this is what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't in the streets and we've,
we've, um, we're hearing nature's riot
[SPEAKER_14]: and, um, we haven't listened so well.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, even with, we just all have to put
our ears to the ground and to each other's
[SPEAKER_14]: heart and try to more deeply listen to the
greater needs that are surrounding us
[SPEAKER_14]: because the world's in a riot and our
people are too, cause we haven't heard and
[SPEAKER_14]: haven't listened.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, it's getting louder and hotter
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but, uh, yeah, I was just thinking,
you know, even, uh, a thousand strikes and
[SPEAKER_14]: COVID COVID it's like this nature's bio
terrorism and, um, and fires and
[SPEAKER_14]: hurricanes and tornadoes and it's nature,
but it is, it is profound and impactful.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm getting ready to host some people
again that are displaced.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of, a lot of people in this and in
this vicinity right now are in deep
[SPEAKER_14]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that many of you have been
faced with, with this as well as this
[SPEAKER_14]: problem with facing these issues as well
in, in your communities.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, we're going to host some folks
here and, uh, it'll be nice to have some
[SPEAKER_14]: new, new safe, protected COVID protected
folks in the house.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's a, it's a crazy time,
a time that we have to reimagine how to
[SPEAKER_14]: deeply connect.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we can deeply connect,
but it's interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: We walk around with masks on and try to
see each other's.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've just, I've just gotten to saying
hello to people because it's hard to tell
[SPEAKER_14]: if someone's smiling or not.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, I think that, um,
we want to connect.
[SPEAKER_14]: We really do, but it's not that simple
process.
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I digress here, but thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big love and respect to you on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And on that note, and that's, that's the,
that's the, the big energy that's been
[SPEAKER_12]: going in to everyone's farm this year,
I think is just to bring that self
[SPEAKER_12]: reliance and just that, to bring that
stability through your own work and
[SPEAKER_12]: through your own community and,
and realizing that you're as strong as
[SPEAKER_12]: your community that's around you and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the big love to Brett from Dos Paros
there in Santa Cruz who did lose his home
[SPEAKER_12]: and Cruz extracts few farms, you know,
that did lose their farms.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's ways you can reach out to them and
help them.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's been pretty hectic.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been pretty hectic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like Valerie, you just said,
you know, people hit the streets,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are hitting the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's just such an
amazing term for, you know, community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Communing with, with our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say hit the streets and when we
say that we're out protesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're with community, we're, we're,
we're with our, our, our people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's more important
than ever that we reach out to community
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, that even though we might be
behind masks, we have this incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to reach out to community and
connect almost on a deeper level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, even though it's through
screens and we can't touch and we are
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated physically, we're able to go
deeper than I know that we've ever gone
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the work that's getting done through
community and through connection is
[SPEAKER_01]: astounding right now in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have so much love and
appreciation for all of these amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are connected to this master
plan, doing the good work for the whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Valerie, for your work and
everybody else here on this panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Debra and Colin and everything that
you were doing at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big love to everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw Soma.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen him in a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us today, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much heart.
[SPEAKER_13]: Totally welcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great to see and hear you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Peter, how about yourself,
bud?
[SPEAKER_13]: How have you been?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm super grateful to be here with
all you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been doing a lot of work in the last
couple of years since I've been on Hash
[SPEAKER_19]: Church.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been a while, I think, or maybe a
year since the last time around there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like it's been forever since I
even did one.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, even in this 3.0 series,
there's only been nine of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've been doing a lot of hemp
consulting lately.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we consulted for 160 different hemp
farmers in 2019, which was a journey then.
[SPEAKER_19]: We kind of went into large-scale
industrial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we tried to help a lot of these guys
transition or learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_19]: organically.
[SPEAKER_19]: So chemical farmers that had been
historically accustomed to pushing a
[SPEAKER_19]: button to take care of their problems were
now coming into this whole new era.
[SPEAKER_19]: This whole world of growing and being in
integrity and in a different consciousness
[SPEAKER_19]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was unbelievable to see how a human
being could actually get reconnected to
[SPEAKER_19]: nature through the experience of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: So guys that had been traditional chemical
farmers to actually be like, wow,
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe this is the gateway to a whole other
energy or world that can teach me how to
[SPEAKER_19]: become more integrated with nature.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I got to experience that firsthand with
hundreds of farmers.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's incredible, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: See, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: So to see some of the things that are
happening now, the relativity of what had
[SPEAKER_19]: happened in my experience and watching
these farmers, it's like an education that
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe right now what we need to do is all
as a community, like Dragonfly was saying,
[SPEAKER_19]: is kind of come together in a more
integrated, interdependent way,
[SPEAKER_19]: where we're understanding that taking care
of our earth right now for her,
[SPEAKER_19]: she's crying out to us, is so important to
solve a lot of these issues from the
[SPEAKER_19]: ground up.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's what we're doing with soil
balances right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're trying to take care of the soil
because the more we care for our earth in
[SPEAKER_19]: a considerate, compassionate way,
relatively speaking, everything should get
[SPEAKER_19]: a lot more balanced.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the idea of chemical farmers
transitioning into a more sustainable,
[SPEAKER_13]: regenerative, organic way and having
revelations about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was far out.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hadn't heard of the term chemical farmer
before.
[SPEAKER_15]: In a way, being a chemist, that kind of
excites me, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is a chemical farmer just a non-organic
farmer?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that what you're defining?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the guys that are using systemic
fungicides and biocides and synthetic
[SPEAKER_19]: ferts.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a conventional farmer.
[SPEAKER_19]: A conventional, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: What a nice word they gave themselves
though.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're like chemical farming,
like they could actually grow and make
[SPEAKER_15]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything's a chemical.
[SPEAKER_15]: What the plant is doing is making
phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's not distinguish between.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we do distinguish between a little
bit because phyto in front of chemical
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of changes the definition of that
particular chemical, at least in regards
[SPEAKER_13]: to where it came from.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so then that gives people their belief
systems, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: They're like, well, I trust nature,
but I don't trust DuPont.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, you said you consulted for a couple
hundred businesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of them grew a crop in 2020?
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, how many of them in 2019
actually made a profit on growing hemp?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, we consulted for 160 pretty
large scale operations.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, 95% of our customers are not
growing hemp again this season.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're sitting on millions of pounds
of biomass that they can't sell.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've thought a lot about why that is.
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things that I believe is
that they spend so much money and so much
[SPEAKER_19]: time with the logistics of cultivating
that they didn't put enough focus on good
[SPEAKER_19]: cultivation methodologies and practices in
taking care of their soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the terpene levels inside the
finished commodity were like 0.1,
[SPEAKER_19]: 0.2% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: So then what they were doing is they were
taking that oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were actually processing it on an
industrial scale with ethanol and CO2.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what was happening is those processing
methods were burning out that very small
[SPEAKER_19]: amount of terpene content that was inside
of the flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what ended up happening was people were
starting to sell this full spectrum
[SPEAKER_19]: organic CBD isolate, really, because it
didn't have the most important compounds
[SPEAKER_19]: to the efficacy of the plant, as we all
know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Full spectrum isolate.
[SPEAKER_13]: That caught my ear as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard that, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would have to be distillate.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it wouldn't be full spectrum because
distillate isn't full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_19]: The CBD was going into these tinctures and
bait pens and edibles and topicals.
[SPEAKER_19]: People were using CBD, and they were
disenchanted.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're like, I'm spending $60 on this
CBD tincture, and I don't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I supposed to feel something?
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what ended up happening was my
opinion was that those terpenes were not
[SPEAKER_19]: in that finished product that was being
put out to the market on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the absorption rates in the
industry were really low because it didn't
[SPEAKER_19]: work.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was working.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was working.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they were getting it back.
[SPEAKER_15]: If the tincture is made with an extract
where the terpenes are retained,
[SPEAKER_15]: then they're going to have all the
plantiness and probably plant pigments
[SPEAKER_15]: going to taste like.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it's just made with isolate or even
distillate, then it's not going to taste
good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Mark, you got muted.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, a distillate with no terpenes,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, the flour has 0.1% terpenes in
it.
[SPEAKER_19]: The CO2 in the ethanol goes into an
extreme heat, as you guys know as
[SPEAKER_19]: processors.
[SPEAKER_19]: It burns out the small amount of terpenes
that are in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you look at the profiles of the
treated flour, there was only maybe five
[SPEAKER_19]: or six types of terpenes in the profile,
versus like what you guys are getting is
[SPEAKER_19]: like 20 types of terpenes or what
Dragonfly gets.
[SPEAKER_19]: They get a broad spectrum because they've
got that biodiversity in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're already starting out with a
disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you're burning them out.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, you know, again, it was advertised
as this amazing product that's going to
[SPEAKER_19]: heal.
[SPEAKER_19]: People started taking it and they didn't
really feel much.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so they didn't want to spend 60 bucks
again on a tincture.
[SPEAKER_13]: What about the idea of these farmers who
were conventional farmers?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm guessing their land was very
contaminated with synthetic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they're planting a
phyto-remediative plant like hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder what that plant would be pulling
up into its very being, like right into
[SPEAKER_13]: its cells, right into the resin,
right into all of those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's always my kind of worry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of those chemicals degrade though.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they degrade.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when they do, they're mostly degraded
by light and heat, but also mostly
[SPEAKER_15]: degraded by bugs, by microbes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, a lot of those, they're just
organic compounds and they're degraded in
[SPEAKER_15]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's not really too many persistent
compounds that are used.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's a few.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know the tobacco industry has one
called Radium-226 because it's how Joe
[SPEAKER_13]: Strobel, one of the first hemp farmers in
Canada, learned that hemp was a
[SPEAKER_13]: phyto-remediative plant because people
weren't really talking about it,
[SPEAKER_13]: at least in the small circles we knew of
back then.
[SPEAKER_13]: But this tobacco farmer, Joe Strobel,
who got the first license to grow hemp in
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada in over like 75 years, 1994 in
Ontario, he was a tobacco farmer and Jeff
[SPEAKER_13]: Kime was his partner, was a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_13]: They got it done.
[SPEAKER_13]: They planted this five acre experimental
field.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess because of this chemical,
this radioactive nucleotide that basically
[SPEAKER_13]: gets put into the soil, they have to like
test the soil every year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the hemp crop,
they tested it and it was shockingly low,
[SPEAKER_13]: lower than they'd ever seen it go down by
like some ridiculous amount.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what it was, but five or 10
times.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so then they had to test the hemp to
figure out what was going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was actually, that was the
information that came to our group that
[SPEAKER_13]: started that phyto-remediative project in
Chernobyl, growing hemp to remove
[SPEAKER_13]: radioactive nucleotides out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it definitely does that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It does.
[SPEAKER_19]: It does.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it pulls out heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_19]: It can pull out all kinds of different
locked up chlorinated hydrocarbons that
[SPEAKER_19]: are insoluble-ized in the soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things that we really tried
to do was cultivate the hemp in a highly
[SPEAKER_19]: biologically active system where the
biology on thousands of acres was dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was destroyed because of how the
compounds in a lot of these materials
[SPEAKER_19]: actually burns out the biology.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we had to do, because just to
digress a little bit, what good biology
[SPEAKER_19]: will do is it will actually grow on the
rhizosphere and it will kind of mediate
[SPEAKER_19]: some of the absorption rates of toxins
that go into the plant, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a beautiful natural thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the correct biology can actually
attach to those hydrocarbons, solubilize
[SPEAKER_19]: them and help them reach out of the soil
by increasing the bulk density of the soil
[SPEAKER_19]: and the porosity.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that way when water comes in,
a lot of those toxins are leached out and
[SPEAKER_19]: purified.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that isn't the case in a lot of these
large scale operations.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had to really do some preliminary
testing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We couldn't plant in areas where they were
doing cotton because of glyphosate drift.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, there were so many different
challenges that what we faced.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's been a battle, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been like 14 hour days working with
these guys and trying to help them,
[SPEAKER_19]: really.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, that's the whole focus.
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now it's unfortunate that a lot
of these farmers are not able,
[SPEAKER_19]: good people, kind, beautiful people that
want to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: They believe in this plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: They believe it's going to help so much.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're having a hard time on top of
all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's a question kind of to Dr. Mark
as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: As to Dragonfly Earth medicine,
because I hear Mark saying, well,
[SPEAKER_13]: those are, you know, he used the term
chemical wrong and I could see that get
[SPEAKER_13]: under your skin as a chemist.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all chemicals, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all chemicals.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, don't you believe,
Mark, Dr. Mark, that some of the chemicals
[SPEAKER_13]: that are being put on the scale on large
scale are destroying the soil?
[SPEAKER_13]: Or do you really believe?
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they must be right.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not destroying the soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what they're doing is they're altering
the life of the soil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's kind of like Mother Nature's
biome will kind of adapt to this new
[SPEAKER_15]: synthetic chemical that Dow or DuPont or
whoever is making in spring.
[SPEAKER_15]: But like one of the things that I noticed,
I mean, it's really interesting to hear
[SPEAKER_15]: you say all that, Peter, because the folks
around here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, where I live in Pennsylvania,
most of the Amish are also tobacco
[SPEAKER_15]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they understand growing a crop for
essentially essential oil or for to be
[SPEAKER_15]: sold for smoking purposes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're able to basically grow to the
volume at which they can dry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they all have these tobacco barns.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're really cool looking barns.
[SPEAKER_15]: The sides of the barn open like wings.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it could air out.
[SPEAKER_15]: The air has to exchange.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the tobacco gets picked right
around the time that hemp gets picked,
[SPEAKER_15]: actually gets picked just prior to that,
gets hung up in these barns.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I tell you, man, when you walk up to
the edge of these barns, I'm not a
[SPEAKER_15]: cigarette smoker.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't use tobacco in any form.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you walk up next to these barns,
man, that air is intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is really for a non cigarette smoker.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, whoa, you just kind of like blown
away by it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway, the first year that they
really grew widespread around here,
[SPEAKER_15]: most of these farms are on the order of
about 10.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are more like around 40 to 60
to 80 acres.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of them grow feed corn for for
the dairy industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty big in my area of
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, they're also growing tobacco.
[SPEAKER_15]: And where they grew tobacco, they have a
whole system where they have these carts
[SPEAKER_15]: that go out and they hang tobacco leaves
on the cart and they bring.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they didn't have all that worked out
for hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they needed to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So last year was kind of like a training
wheels years.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, a lot of them, they didn't dry
right away.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them had issues with bugs and some
of them had issues with some people
[SPEAKER_15]: brought dryers into the area and were able
to dry hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for the most part, I think they had a
pretty successful crop when they compare
[SPEAKER_15]: it to the return on value that they can
get compared to another crop.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of these folks are growing
ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, for the flower markets and
they're growing vegetables like tomatoes
[SPEAKER_15]: and melons, cantaloupes, watermelons,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is a different kind of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_15]: But to speak to your organic thing,
I think a lot of these folks grow
[SPEAKER_15]: organically.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what they're doing is they're bolting
on the organic certification onto their
[SPEAKER_15]: existing organic certification.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you already have an organic farm and
they've already been come out to certify
[SPEAKER_15]: it, to make sure that your processes and
really everything that touches the crop is
[SPEAKER_15]: organic and chemical free.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although they do list a list of chemicals
that you could use in an organic thing,
[SPEAKER_15]: just organic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, just to finally divide it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, organic chemical, unless we're
importing feedstocks from Mars,
[SPEAKER_15]: everything comes from planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_15]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been to Selma's house and I've seen
some shit that was absolutely not from
[SPEAKER_13]: planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bringing in some stuff from some stardust,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think for the most part,
I would say that what really stalled was
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of like the FDA in making an
exception of the FD&C rule so they could
[SPEAKER_15]: include CBD in things like topicals and
foods and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what that did is it created all
this huge glut of biomass that's on the
[SPEAKER_15]: market.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what that did is it made, so about a
year ago, the price of isolate from large
[SPEAKER_15]: manufacturers in like Portland and Denver
area that we're processing lots of have,
[SPEAKER_15]: price of isolate was on the order of about
5,000 to maybe 7,000 a kilo.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's for multiple kilograms.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they want to look for, you know,
big contracts so they could set up some
[SPEAKER_15]: big supply chains.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well now, the bottom has just crashed on
that market.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get those same kilograms now for
less than a thousand dollars a kilogram.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's such a supply, but there's no
real pull through in the retail.
[SPEAKER_15]: You say that and then you go on the
internet and you find all of these
[SPEAKER_15]: companies selling everything from gummies
to lotions to all this stuff that,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, is derived from hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of folks are putting either
isolate, there's this whole category now
[SPEAKER_15]: of tea free distillate.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in order for it to be farm bill legal,
it has to have a THC content of below
[SPEAKER_15]: 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a whole new industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about the new amendment that the DEA
just made to the definition of hemp?
[SPEAKER_15]: So what they're trying to do with that,
Marcus, is they're trying to harmonize the
[SPEAKER_15]: Controlled Dangerous Substance Act with
the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the farm bill basically says if it's
below 0.3% THC attempt, therefore it's
[SPEAKER_15]: legal by the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we all know that even if you purify
the oil or even if you shuck the buds from
[SPEAKER_15]: a 0.3% plant, you're going to purify
beyond that 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly when you make a crude extract or
a distillate or an isolate, well,
[SPEAKER_15]: not the isolate, but the distillate,
you're going to concentrate the THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't think they truly
fundamentally understood that when they
[SPEAKER_15]: passed the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what that's come up with now is
now, again, there's a whole new group of
[SPEAKER_15]: processors that are basically offering
what's called tea free remediate or
[SPEAKER_15]: distillate remediation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Will it take the distillate that's got a
THC higher?
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't matter though, because the way
that amendment sits is that the second
[SPEAKER_13]: your product becomes over 0.3%,
it's now a schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in your workflow, you're now
breaking a schedule one law.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's a major blow.
[SPEAKER_15]: What they try to do is classify something
called work in progress hemp extract.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the work in progress hemp extract,
so everything between the biomass and the
[SPEAKER_15]: diluted tincture itself is all,
yeah, schedule one.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they wanted to basically say,
look, if that's in a process where it's
[SPEAKER_15]: not being sold or not crossing state
lines, then it's okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it has created a lot of upset in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other thing that people were
doing, Marcus, we kind of talked a little
[SPEAKER_15]: bit about this on the chat is a lot of
people because of the price of CBD is
[SPEAKER_15]: down, they're converting THC over into
Delta A THC by Michelin chemistry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Professor Michelin for pointing
out that you can just CBD under a civic
[SPEAKER_15]: condition and in fact, I think when people
were making CBD distillate, and they were
[SPEAKER_15]: adding bleaching clays to the CBD
distillate, when they were distilling,
[SPEAKER_15]: they were observing THC over in the
product.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's because the clays
themselves are acidic in nature and are
[SPEAKER_15]: acidic enough to promote the isomerization
from CBD over the THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you get Delta A THC almost
predominantly, but you do get a little bit
[SPEAKER_15]: of Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's one of the issues with the
Delta 8 supply now, and you see Delta 8
[SPEAKER_15]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of that Delta 8 has beyond 0.3% Delta
9, which is part of what is problematic
[SPEAKER_15]: about that DEA interim final ruling.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they call it, interim final
ruling.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see the second part of it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I know that they're asking for
public comment.
[SPEAKER_13]: Before public comment, in the definition
change, they also made another change,
[SPEAKER_13]: which was for any companies that had FDA,
whatever the term is, compliance or
[SPEAKER_13]: approved or whatever, which I think one
company in the world has, they no longer
[SPEAKER_13]: have to apply for import or export
licenses to move their product over the
[SPEAKER_13]: border.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the part that left an even worse
taste in my mouth about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I saw that, I was like, oh man,
they are like lining up the chessboard.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark, you kind of brought something up
I've been thinking a lot about.
[SPEAKER_20]: I grew, I work with a 2,600 acre farm in
upstate New York that is fully
[SPEAKER_20]: regenerative, certified organic.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we, you know, they grow 30 acres of
hemp on rotation up there.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, last season, you know,
we've been asked specifically for tea
[SPEAKER_20]: free.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this whole year, it's just been
tea free.
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have tea free?
[SPEAKER_20]: But then, you know, as I look at the barns
and I look at the totes, I just,
[SPEAKER_20]: I question like, what's enough and how do
we all balance the amount that we grow
[SPEAKER_20]: versus what someone else grows?
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there is harmony and everyone does
have a place.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it goes back to the idea of
Appalachia and then the terroir that we've
[SPEAKER_20]: all been talking about specific regions,
only working with specific cultivars.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, what are your thoughts on what's
enough, guys?
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I think about this often,
you know, because it's, we've learned to
[SPEAKER_20]: scale, but you know, what's the right
amount to scale to, you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think my thoughts are that dragonfly
earth medicine and permaculture and some
[SPEAKER_19]: of the growers that I'm talking to with
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like if we actually have, again,
a deeper connection and respect and do
[SPEAKER_19]: things in integrity with our planet,
then a permaculture setting is actually
[SPEAKER_19]: going to produce the correct amount of
food that we can sustain our populations
[SPEAKER_19]: on.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they've already figured it out.
[SPEAKER_19]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_19]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_19]: Planet's intelligence is just so perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a sacred vessel that we just have to,
you know, allow to produce the amount of
[SPEAKER_19]: tomatoes and corn and cabbage and wheat
and soy that we need to eat.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it'll show us what we're supposed to
have, you know, what we're supposed to
[SPEAKER_19]: receive from it, the way that I kind of
see it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to speak with an analogy for a
second.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to speak with an analogy and
I've done this before, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So I always used to say that, you know,
THC is the deep end, CBD is the shallow
[SPEAKER_15]: end and the two ends of the pool are
connected together, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Mother Nature didn't make an
exclusion.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the analogy I'd like to use for the
tea-free thing is purple paint,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's purple paint made of?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's made of red paint and blue paint,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So, well, in the political year,
we'll call CBD blue and we'll call THC
[SPEAKER_15]: red, okay?
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have to separate the red from the
blue paint.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you can do it by chromatography,
but you get a big fraction in the middle.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where you get a lot of THC and CBD,
you have to bring right back through in
[SPEAKER_15]: your chromatography.
[SPEAKER_15]: So chromatography is just not,
it's an ugly process.
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't scale well.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to use a shitload of solvent.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the whole need to make a
tea-free product that is just completely
[SPEAKER_15]: just ludicrous, all based on, they didn't
figure, well, if the plants got 0.3g when
[SPEAKER_15]: they concentrated, it's going to be more,
you know, concentrated.
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as it's back down to the 0.3 in
the final product, that only puts it in
[SPEAKER_15]: tinctures and lotions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so you can't dab it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: At least they should be able to make it
harmonize in that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the work-in-progress hemp extract has
got to be something that they got to let
[SPEAKER_15]: hemp processors be able to handle,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if you're bringing in 0.3 into the
building, as soon as you concentrate it,
[SPEAKER_15]: as soon as you grind it, as soon as you
make an extract out of it, it's over 0.3.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the whole point of the industry is to
be able to extract and use the plant that
[SPEAKER_15]: the farm bill has already said is legal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and they let that happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: They let that happen right to the point
where the industry almost destroyed itself
[SPEAKER_13]: and there's no value in the product now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and Marcus, what that tells you is
how bright the intellectual furnaces are
[SPEAKER_15]: that are burning down in DC these days,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I apologize to jump in,
but Valerie, could you actually speak on a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of your experience on the
efficacy of the actual extract ratios of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant versus this whole conversation
around T-free or separating Delta-9 so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just isolated pure CBD?
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Alec.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there are a few things here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, many things on the table,
but as we look at the overproduction of
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD and we ask ourselves, well,
how did that even happen?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's obvious that it's the marketing
behind it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the trending.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what information came out and was
hyped.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a little bit like the conspiracy
of CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the QAnon, really what happened here.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even really true.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what occurs or may be found in
some titrations and in some instances is
[SPEAKER_14]: not true across the board.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, every single being is
unique.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my findings, now this is, you know,
it's limited, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's anecdotal, but I work with people,
so that's quite a good cross-section.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I find that without the THC,
the T-free is essentially, for the people
[SPEAKER_14]: with whom I've worked, essentially
ineffective.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to say that there is no benefit for
some people, there is.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would say it's very few.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very few, at least in our,
in our, the cross-section of our
[SPEAKER_14]: membership.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I think I think the
imbalance here is as the market become,
[SPEAKER_14]: as laws are written to take over the
market or control the market, a
[SPEAKER_14]: marketplace, no matter what market that
is, the danger is in the hype or the
[SPEAKER_14]: trending that surrounds that product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, I mean, there's an overproduction
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_14]: If we look at the, the reasons are many.
[SPEAKER_14]: And one, it's because, you know,
perfectly good farmers needed to grow
[SPEAKER_14]: something to be able to live on,
to gain enough revenue.
[SPEAKER_14]: But really CBD, it's, CBD is not really
the answer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying that it is not part of an
answer, but it is not the efficacy that
[SPEAKER_14]: relates to CBD only with cancers,
even with our unique group of epileptics.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that, you know, if we look at
the health of our patients and especially
[SPEAKER_14]: with children, especially with the
children that we work with, THC is a very
[SPEAKER_14]: profound part of their, of the healing
process for them, or at least to sustain
[SPEAKER_14]: wellness, to reduce seizure activity.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, I think that, again,
there, there are two different topics on
[SPEAKER_14]: the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: One is farming and maintaining the
relationship of farmers to the food and
[SPEAKER_14]: medicine, plant medicines, plant foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bioremediating.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it, it bioremediates as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but how, and that is not only food for
us as human beings, but food for nature,
[SPEAKER_14]: the planet as well, and the balance that
we bring into living and feeding off this
[SPEAKER_14]: planet and nurturing it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's a very, it's a, it's a huge
opportunity and yet we're not working
[SPEAKER_14]: together.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're working against an umbrella or
really a dome of kind of federal pirating
[SPEAKER_14]: and corporate, you know, the, how the
corporations in, how corporations
[SPEAKER_14]: influence the laws in order to obtain
complete control over product and the mass
[SPEAKER_14]: delivery of that product.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say, you know, that CBD trended to
be a great deal more than it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not, not that it doesn't have some
efficacy, because of course it does.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now without THC, I mean, we just,
again, that's within our group.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't see the effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just haven't seen it personally.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking about a handful of people
either.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quite a big number.
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it is not, you know, 10,000 people,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and Val, can I actually jump in
on that too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know, I know Jason David has the
exact same story as well, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the pediatric epilepsy kids that
he works with, you know, they found kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of, because there was so many kind of CBD
products in the market that were just
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated CBD, you know, they were having
issues with administering that to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatric epilepsy kids where they would
in fact have more seizures than they've
[SPEAKER_02]: had in recent time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ultimately I know Jayden,
his son and Jason's David whole journey
[SPEAKER_02]: with his pediatric epilepsy group was kind
of diving more into acidic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're finding more consistent
ability across batches to fight effect and
[SPEAKER_02]: healing than they would in just the batch
to batch kind of isolated CBDs where they
[SPEAKER_02]: were trying to find a kind of more whole
plant kind of side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I just wanted to kind of point
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then kind of to the fighter
remediation point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting because you
know, the endocannabinoid system is the
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the master homeostatic regulating
system in our body, you know, bring your
[SPEAKER_02]: balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like it's doing that to the
earth to where we plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much of the cannabis and hemp that
we're planting, inadvertently,
[SPEAKER_02]: is fighter remediating the soil and bio
accumulating all the toxins from heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals and historical agricultural
compounds that are used in the area
[SPEAKER_02]: thought to have, you know, multiple day
half lives turning out to have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, decade half lives when they're
in the soil in the dark, hidden under the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground because of how much they were used
in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, just this idea of
homeostasis regulation, and how kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is doing that to our body and in
healing, I feel like it's definitely doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that to the earth too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're when we talk about
planting hemp, it's like where we what are
[SPEAKER_02]: we planting it for?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is it going for drug medicines
for whole plant extracts are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatric epilepsy, kids and cancer
patients, or, or should it be going to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, grow, grow rope for multiple years
in fighter remediate the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and focus on that side of it,
you know, so that one day they can do
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant extracts instead of just,
you know, isolate CBD because anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that's doing isolate, isolate CBD is
essentially, you know, in a forced
[SPEAKER_02]: position to do that because of how much
heavy metals or pesticides are in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, be and that's beyond just
working to get around the point 3%,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, legal Yeah, it's the warp
regulation, you know, like the people that
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm working with are, you know,
again, they're, they're able to get into
[SPEAKER_15]: the shallow end of the pool, they can't
get go down into deep end yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they got to keep everything compliant.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this this latest interim ruling from
the from the DA is just problematic in
[SPEAKER_15]: that anybody who's taking, you know,
legalized hemp, which was made legal from
[SPEAKER_15]: the farm bill, it says 0.3% into their
building, now, as Marcus points out,
[SPEAKER_15]: as soon as they're processing it,
it becomes again, schedule one material.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that just, I think it just points out
the inconsistencies in the two.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, what I don't hope is that
they're giving Trump an idea to throw a
[SPEAKER_15]: Hail Mary here to save the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I should say that probably.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know, I think again, I really,
I understand what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_15]: Valerie, and love to be able to use the
whole plant spectrum of the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_15]: teaches anything it teaches us that single
ingredient medicine is just not
[SPEAKER_15]: appropriate and not correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think your your patient results
speak volumes to that point.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if you follow it back to its root,
it's really quite easy and simple to see,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, oh, how did CBD get so hyped?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, well, you had an enormous
amount of people who decided they wanted
[SPEAKER_13]: to make money in an industry like cannabis
that wasn't cannabis that didn't have THC
[SPEAKER_13]: that somehow had isolated through this,
you know, narrative that was created,
[SPEAKER_13]: however many years ago, oh, no,
this is hemp, a distant relative of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and Mark, we said before the,
you know, pharmaceutical companies have us
[SPEAKER_15]: lulled into believing whatever is wrong
with you, there's a there's a pill for
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that pill typically in the in the FDA
paradigm contains a single active
[SPEAKER_15]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the thesarine or bapaputabat or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know how they name those
anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: They just seem like to have some
fictitious name that doesn't, I guess,
[SPEAKER_15]: piss people off or is politically correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, if you listen to those
commercials on television, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_15]: The commercials more about all the side
effects you're going to get when you take
[SPEAKER_15]: this FDA approved drug.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's reason 12,967 that I do not
have cable television.
[SPEAKER_11]: Snip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get rid of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to mention that besides the
problem with low turps and the bad soils,
[SPEAKER_10]: in 2018, less than 50,000 acres of hemp or
CBD was grown in the United States.
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2019, 180,000 acres was planted for
CBD, and the CBD percentages were higher.
[SPEAKER_10]: So think about it, supply and demand is a
hard reality to fight.
[SPEAKER_16]: And having absolutely no infrastructure
doesn't help in any way, shape or form,
[SPEAKER_16]: because it's easier to do CBD,
because all you have to do is put it on a
[SPEAKER_16]: screen as opposed to actually crush the
herds, actually breath the hemp by water
[SPEAKER_16]: or biologicals, etc.
[SPEAKER_16]: So unless these CBD people invest in an
infrastructure, we're stuck with it.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, Etienne, and happy belated
birthday, brother.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Much love to you all.
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy belated birthday.
[SPEAKER_16]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that lamp, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seen that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Etsy.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a lampshade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to be able to pick up a CBD drink
out when I was out and about, but when I
[SPEAKER_00]: look at anything CBD on the menu,
it immediately repels me because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, is it some weird, bizarro
distillate?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know it's safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know it's not going to have any
effect, but just the idea to me now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a turnoff, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a marketing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once the market narrows and we can
trust the suppliers and how the CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: made, maybe we will be able to enjoy it
more in the real world.
[SPEAKER_10]: But assuming you can find pure CBD,
there is a use for it that I can mention.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you do is you make a small pipe load
of homegrown THC weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: You put a little sprinkle full of the pure
CBD on top of it and you bake it or you
[SPEAKER_10]: smoke it and wangle, bangle.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the benefits of the THC,
the terpenes, the full spectrum and the
[SPEAKER_10]: CBD kick in the butt.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: What we ended up doing was we had really
good hemp flowers, so we really grew
[SPEAKER_19]: sustainable, regenerative, organic hemp
crops.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we babyed these plants so well,
we actually got really high terpenes in
[SPEAKER_19]: the flower profile.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were getting between 2.5 and 2.7
percent terpenes in our hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great, Peter.
[SPEAKER_10]: What were the percentages of CBD?
[SPEAKER_19]: It depend on the genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_19]: It depend on the heterogeneous soil and
the fertilization.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of our customers were getting between
15 and 22 percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, contingent on the genetic capacity
before we had to pull.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before we did the aggregate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weren't the majority of those getting more
than 0.3 percent THC?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever I see people that had more than
15 percent CBD, they usually break the THC
[SPEAKER_10]: limits.
[SPEAKER_19]: That goes to the genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: What we did to go more along your point
was because we had about an average of 2.5
[SPEAKER_19]: terpenes and between 20 and 25 terpene
types in the profile, we extracted those.
[SPEAKER_19]: We extracted the terpenes from a lot of
this hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we added it to a lot of the CBD
tinctures that were out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had some experiments where some of our
customers would give that CBD what we are
[SPEAKER_19]: calling right now as an isolate to their
customers.
[SPEAKER_19]: With the terpenes added and without the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: With a lower amount of CBD, the efficacy
was like 10x as far as the- I understand
[SPEAKER_10]: and that makes a lot of sense,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, when you did that,
was the profile and the ratios in the
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes constant?
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, from the dried manicured
flower or whatever you were using to the
[SPEAKER_10]: finished extracted terpenes, did the
ratios remain or did you lose some of the
[SPEAKER_10]: more volatile amount of terpenes?
[SPEAKER_19]: We processed it at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a big thing that took us about
six months to try and figure out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We captured the good majority of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: One lab told us we had more than 30 spikes
within the analysis.
[SPEAKER_19]: We kept most of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: The smell also was the same.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you smelled the flower, versus the
terpenes, it was very- That tells you a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: If the smell is the same, that's a good
sign.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it was the same.
[SPEAKER_19]: When we took those terpenes and we added
them to these edible and topical products,
[SPEAKER_19]: people were actually feeling it.
[SPEAKER_19]: They were like, whoa, this is what CBD is
supposed to feel like.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know that this is what it was.
[SPEAKER_19]: You still got that full body relaxation,
joyous, creative, all those beautiful
[SPEAKER_19]: things that you get with this plant aside
from having the psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, what are we supposed to
be experiencing with CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am an expert with the shop and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: People don't know what they're supposed to
feel.
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, what we're finding is you need to
add terpenes at a milligram per
[SPEAKER_19]: cannabinoid ratio.
[SPEAKER_19]: People don't even know how to apply
terpenes yet in some of these products.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're saying, oh, there's terpenes in
your product.
[SPEAKER_19]: What we have found in our testing is that
for every- It depends on whether you're
[SPEAKER_19]: doing a tincture or a vape pen,
but let's say if you're doing a tincture
[SPEAKER_19]: that has a thousand milligrams of CBD,
you want around a hundred milligrams of
[SPEAKER_19]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good ratio on a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, on a tincture, or wait, I might have
said that backwards.
[SPEAKER_19]: On a tincture, you would want five percent
because otherwise the terpenes are too
[SPEAKER_19]: spicy.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd want 50 milligrams of terpenes
inside a thousand milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a natural ratio.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas in a vape pen, you'd want about a
hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what you're saying,
Peter, because you don't really find even
[SPEAKER_10]: bread for terpenes breaking much over the
five, six percent terpene by dry weight
[SPEAKER_10]: content.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be done, but it's not being sold.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot of work creating something like
that that breaks the five percent.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's been nice for us is we've started
to play with our terpenes in the THC
[SPEAKER_19]: market.
[SPEAKER_19]: People are calling us back some of the
vape pen companies that started to use our
[SPEAKER_19]: terps.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're saying that they're high for four
hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not really high, but four hours
later, they're still feeling the effects.
[SPEAKER_19]: They still have that essence.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also dial in the terpenes so that
you're just adding the ones that offer the
[SPEAKER_10]: specific synergistic effects with THC or
CBD, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I prefer THC myself, so that if you add
Mericine, Pinene, Limelene, and a couple
[SPEAKER_10]: of other ones, they will not only modulate
it in particular ways you'd like them to
[SPEAKER_10]: have the power to potentiate THC and make
it stronger.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are ham derived terpenes,
Peter?
[SPEAKER_19]: They're all ham derived.
[SPEAKER_19]: We did different extractions.
[SPEAKER_19]: When we used the good agricultural
practices, we got 25 terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_19]: profile, maybe more sometimes.
[SPEAKER_19]: In the other sides where we weren't really
amending the soils, we had five.
[SPEAKER_19]: What we're starting to see is that it's
not what one terpene does on its own,
[SPEAKER_19]: but what they produce in combination that
truly make them efficacious.
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you isolating your hemp terpenes?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you isolating your hemp terpenes?
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been playing with all kinds of
different extraction methodologies,
[SPEAKER_19]: but we can chat about that, you and I.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got something different, Mark.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to go to email.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... It's all
good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_20]: What I was going to say, Mark,
is...
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 68% total tack.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 11.7% THCV, 2.8% CBC, 5.5% CBG.
[SPEAKER_20]: But at 11% terpenes, this thing gets me
where I need to go really quickly,
[SPEAKER_20]: and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's actually more enjoyable on the
roll-off on the back end than something in
[SPEAKER_20]: the 80s to me.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can go back to it time and time again
throughout the day and not feel lethargic
[SPEAKER_20]: at all.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think, to your point, the module and
what Sam was touching on, the modulating
[SPEAKER_20]: factors of the terpenes are really
extremely important, more so than I ever
[SPEAKER_20]: thought and ever really believed to be.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think what you've been touching on
really proves that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's an awesome mixture, Colin.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's an awesome mixture out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this is beautiful too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really... There's less than 10
terpenes that potentiate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's maybe twice that number that
modulate the effects and make it up or
[SPEAKER_10]: down, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the Lemon G is a beautiful variety.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure a lot of you guys have grown it,
but for some reason, in the processing of
[SPEAKER_20]: it, it really translates for solving this
really well, but it's a really hard one to
[SPEAKER_20]: work with to get volume.
[SPEAKER_20]: It really doesn't... I love you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: You taking off, Soma?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's taking off.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a cool way to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, Colin.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I've been honing in on this process,
Marcus, as you know, and we've all been
[SPEAKER_20]: learning about this a lot over the years.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think to fractionate is really
interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think to add, to go back and look at the
terpene process, and I don't want to touch
[SPEAKER_20]: on the process too much because I think
like you all in this room, we have our
[SPEAKER_20]: things we want to hold to the chest,
but I think this is really important.
Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: In Hash Church, we used to talk about our
shit all the time before things changed.
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's cool, guys, I'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that extracting terpenes under
vacuum... I vote we change the names to
[SPEAKER_20]: Hash Secret Church.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Extracting terpenes, I think there's
several different methodologies.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's under nitrogen, under vacuum that
goes into cold traps and so on and so
[SPEAKER_20]: forth, and then there's the steam
distillation, and then there's even deeper
[SPEAKER_20]: things that are mixtures of all these
things.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really interested in working with all
those and putting it back as an ingredient
[SPEAKER_20]: like you all are, but I question,
I just want to open up the dialogue to
[SPEAKER_20]: this.
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you believe for terpenes would be
the right avenue for real extraction of
[SPEAKER_20]: the sesquiterpenes and the lot of the
monoterpenes that we know that transform
[SPEAKER_20]: and as they dry, how do we create these
experiences?
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's a very different case
structure on my palate when I smoke flour
[SPEAKER_20]: because it's sheer terpenes and they're
different types of terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: When we're extracting it, mostly for me,
it's fresh material, it's live,
[SPEAKER_20]: and I'm getting a very specific type of
terpene.
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to open up the idea that what are
your thoughts on these different types of
[SPEAKER_20]: terpenes and how they can be utilized
together to create these experiences that
[SPEAKER_20]: are more profound and closer to the
relationships that we have throughout the
[SPEAKER_20]: plant's life cycle, if you will?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I found the monoterpenes were much
more appropriate for both modulating and
[SPEAKER_10]: especially potentiation.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, what is mersene?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that monoterpene, Mark?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And mersene is kind of like the way CBGA
is kind of like the mother of all
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand exactly, Mark.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mersene is kind of like the mother of all
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So usually things that are rich with
mersene are rich with the other
[SPEAKER_15]: monoterpenes that mersene can easily be
rearranged to.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that other one was that hashesine
terpene, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: The degradation terpene that they find in
hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's just one of them, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know anybody who smoked hashesine
with THC to report what it does to THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't those guys?
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that Italian group did that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't smoke it with pure hashesine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I guess the point is that if you're
smoking old hash, aged hash, with a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: crust on the outside, you're probably
smoking some hashesine.
[SPEAKER_10]: That may be true, but that's not science.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just speculation.
[SPEAKER_15]: We could do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here we like to do a mixture of
science and speculation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, fuck yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: We do speck you science here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have some 10 year old hash sitting
here that's pretty crusty on the outside.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do a little experiment,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember we smoked some up in Pemberton,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_20]: That was that same stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: It probably was.
[SPEAKER_20]: Did it taste like perfume?
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember, but I was just super
lit.
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Fucking looking out the mountains with
you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got the craziest turf profile that
I've never ... When I first started
[SPEAKER_13]: smoking it, because I had a bunch of it
and I broke it up in a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_13]: ways and put it in a bunch of different
spots.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to see how it preserved
differently.
[SPEAKER_13]: The one that seemed to preserve the most
unique just hardened over completely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then this goo in the middle just has this
almost Mendo breath-like perfume taste to
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's insane when you exhale it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are any of you working with flavonoids and
their antioxidant capabilities and the
[SPEAKER_14]: capacity for that?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's 21 flavonoids found in cannabis or
23.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to explore them just like we
did with terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I found out was that flavonoids,
when you smoke them, if you take them
[SPEAKER_10]: orally, they're active.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you smoke them, they deactivate them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not contributing to the subjective
effects of THC, which is my interest.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they affected then by ...
[SPEAKER_14]: In extraction?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Invite Kansas for a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you just ask the question?
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not thermally stable.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they affected by low food olive oil
extraction?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same way?
[SPEAKER_14]: They are.
Yes.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark, why don't you chime in and explain
that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of them are what are called
glycosides.
[SPEAKER_15]: What glycosides are, there are two
portions to the molecule.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a terpenoid portion to the
molecule and there's a sugar portion of
[SPEAKER_15]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_15]: These things are absolutely thermally
unstable.
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, I think they're part of the
components that make distillate like
[SPEAKER_15]: orange and dark red.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you see some of those dark colors in
there.
[SPEAKER_15]: The one thing about flavonoids is that
they really have what's called a high
[SPEAKER_15]: extinction coefficient, which means that a
little bit of the compound goes a long way
[SPEAKER_15]: in terms of imparting color into it.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I do know is that they are thermally
unstable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any process that applies heat to an
extract will degrade those compounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen them in our chromatography come
after the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: Typically, what that means is that they're
really, really polar.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just normal phase chromatography,
just flash chromatography on the bench.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just a mixture of many,
many different compounds, at least we
[SPEAKER_15]: found.
[SPEAKER_19]: Room temperature is the key with the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_19]: Room temperature.
[SPEAKER_19]: Room temperature processing with a
multiple step distillation process is key
[SPEAKER_19]: to keeping the integrity of all of those
little guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you had some methodology then that
could actually then heat from its stable
[SPEAKER_16]: point to the vaporization of cannabis,
could there be a vaporization intake that
[SPEAKER_16]: way as opposed to a flash heat?
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an interesting thought.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't be wrong, but I don't think you
can distill them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they thermally degrade.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you talk about flavonoids,
it's a very general class of compounds,
[SPEAKER_15]: but the ones that are found in cannabis
for the most part are things like
[SPEAKER_15]: glycosides.
[SPEAKER_15]: Typically, you can't distill those.
Typically.
[SPEAKER_20]: The thing I run into mostly is at least in
the state I'm in with the license that I'm
[SPEAKER_20]: part of is we don't have anyone that can
really test for them.
[SPEAKER_20]: On the hemp side, there's someone in
Florida that you can send your material
[SPEAKER_20]: to, but it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm asking questions that no one has the
equipment to give me answers for or with.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very limited in terms of what we can
actually learn, at least for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have access to HPLC?
[SPEAKER_20]: The labs I work with in the state of
Massachusetts only go so far.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's three labs in the total state.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to have an HPLC in your lab,
Kyle, and you should have one that you can
[SPEAKER_15]: just do your R&D routine research with so
you can answer some questions for
[SPEAKER_15]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're in the midst of, it's a big
conversation, but yes, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been a slow burn for a lot of
reasons, but we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_15]: The common flavonoids, I do believe that
there's HPLC standards for them.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can actually develop analytical and
follow up with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can talk about it offline if you want.
[SPEAKER_20]: I will, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: Valerie brought up a good point.
[SPEAKER_20]: The flavonoids are really important in a
plethora of ways.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they're really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's cool that you brought that up because
it's a conversation I have with myself
[SPEAKER_20]: often.
[SPEAKER_14]: There has to be a way to retain flavonoids
aside from chewing on them.
[SPEAKER_14]: There has to be a way to retain them if
any of you explored that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Does flash freezing help or does that
destroy or shatter?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think she brought up a good point.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about room temperature juicing?
[SPEAKER_14]: Juicing is obviously a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cumbersome and, of course,
not available to the majority of people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially people who are ill who cannot
either wait to grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be good to freeze and freeze and sell
something or give it away either because
[SPEAKER_14]: of the dangers that are associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, are the flavonoids water soluble?
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, some of them are, but they're
not very water soluble.
[SPEAKER_15]: What they will create is an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a carbohydrate portion of the
molecule that's water soluble,
[SPEAKER_15]: but then there's a terpenoid portion which
is more hydrocarbon-like.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would create a soap.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would create an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the other interesting aspect about
it is that as cannabis ages, flavonoids
[SPEAKER_15]: are antioxidants and I believe that they
do have some role in our food and our diet
[SPEAKER_15]: to act as antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, we don't consume most of our
antioxidants in our diet by smoking them.
[SPEAKER_15]: We eat them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Juicing makes a lot of sense on that
level.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why the raw food, flavonoids are an
important part of the antioxidant culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems sensible to figure out a way
to provide them for people who cannot
[SPEAKER_14]: access them in the way that we normally or
whether it's socially or medically.
[SPEAKER_16]: What sort of juicer do you recommend for
someone to use?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I figure you probably need a
little more industrial strength using to
[SPEAKER_16]: work with hemp.
[SPEAKER_16]: It can destroy conventional machinery.
[SPEAKER_16]: What type of juicer do you use,
Valerie?
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you everybody recommend for the
people who are watching?
[SPEAKER_10]: Norwalk.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_14]: Norwalk is incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a particular model or is it just
known as Norwalk?
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just see.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know what mine is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a hydraulic press built into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent machines.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the part of the whole, I think,
Gerson therapy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gerson also has a juicer, but the Norwalk
juicer is generally the one that has a
[SPEAKER_14]: hydraulic press and I think some like a
vortex cutter, something like that that
[SPEAKER_14]: they talk about.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're expensive, so there are
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really know what is comparable to
it, but it is supposed to be the premium
[SPEAKER_14]: juicer.
[SPEAKER_16]: What does a Norwalk cost on average?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like 500 bucks or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, around there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get more expensive ones,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's $5,000 Norwalk juicers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but those are big industrial
machines.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not as big as you'd think.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're around a grand or so.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't bought one for 35 or 40 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll always find one on eBay for 500,
but I don't think you're going to find it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're probably more like 1,000
to 2,000 somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a money back guarantee,
but if you're going to use it and it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: really hard, good quality machine,
it would be tough to find a better one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder what alternatives.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, what about fresh pressing?
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked about juicing, but what about
pressing?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not talking like rosin pressing,
but is there a way to cold press?
[SPEAKER_16]: The cannabis in a way that would be
worthy?
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Doc?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would think yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're talking like cold pressed olive
oil, that kind of processing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It almost gets into the rosin category
because if you're actually squeezing the
[SPEAKER_15]: plant, aren't you going to thermally
extrude the oil?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're worried about the temperatures,
Mark, you could freeze it overnight first,
[SPEAKER_10]: then put it through that machine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: My mind was stuck on our last conversation
about flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking more along the lines of
what type of benefits do you see with
[SPEAKER_15]: flavonoids?
[SPEAKER_15]: Where perhaps like a water hash again,
where you're getting a real cold extract,
[SPEAKER_15]: but a particular combination of
cannabinoids, flavonoids, and all the
[SPEAKER_15]: other minor components that you could get
in an extract like that versus something
[SPEAKER_15]: where you're, I hate putting heat on these
terpene profiles because heat and air
[SPEAKER_15]: starts roasting the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And especially the monoturps that Sam was
talking about, the most sensitive
[SPEAKER_15]: compounds of the fragrance profile itself
will all start oxidizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you see the analysis of heavily
processed materials, it's high in
[SPEAKER_10]: sesquiterpenes, low in monoturpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: All that reflects really, Sam,
is that they did probably a solvent
[SPEAKER_15]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_15]: Somewhere in their extraction process and
during that solvent recovery, they
[SPEAKER_15]: probably coiled off most volatile terpenes
and what remains behind or less volatile.
[SPEAKER_14]: We know what kind of results we would get
because we don't know how many people
[SPEAKER_14]: juice consistently fresh cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the measure?
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not really looking at it,
so we can't exactly measure it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I mean, juicing fresh cannabis
is incredible.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I may jump in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just was getting my, I was just
getting finished getting a haircut at a
[SPEAKER_02]: barber called Get Faded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a couple things I wanted,
I was really stoked to jump in on.
Get Faded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Get Faded barber shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_15]: Put a mask on, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I just got to my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the juicing part, so Dr. Courtney
was my first medical doctor in California
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's in so many ways the big boss dude
on the juicing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really Godfathered juicing all the
things and he became a really good friend
[SPEAKER_02]: of mine before he moved to South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he, towards the end there,
he was really advocating also blending,
[SPEAKER_02]: like de-veining the plant and blending it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a Vitamix or a Ninja,
it's a lot more accessible for the average
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of patient with a plant or two in
their yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you did very, very great
way also to get this kind of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure also preserving whatever
flavonoids present in the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're on juicing, I'll kind of
back off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love to, at some point,
whenever, you know, kind of share some
[SPEAKER_02]: information on the mono and sesquiterpenes
to some of the terpene kind of dialogue
[SPEAKER_02]: that was happening a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. William Courtney came to mind the
second they started talking about juicing
[SPEAKER_13]: to me as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's, yeah, definitely incredible.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I still follow him on Facebook,
which his wife now runs that account and
[SPEAKER_13]: they make posts every once in a while
about their chickens and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I hope they're doing well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really brought it to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool temperatures are important.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cooling is the biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: Accessibility for everyone becomes the
biggest problem because we don't know what
[SPEAKER_14]: it can, obviously it has benefits,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Would a wine press work, guys?
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, to Sam's point, you know,
some of the guys in our lab use a wine
[SPEAKER_20]: press to squeeze out material after it's
been decarbed.
[SPEAKER_20]: And spent just to kind of help it along to
get green wasted.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I think that perhaps
something, it's just like a crank,
[SPEAKER_20]: but it's cranked down with a big circular
vat and perhaps something like that would
[SPEAKER_20]: work.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think of flash freezing and then
pressing because I, you know, avoiding the
[SPEAKER_16]: heat, but somehow trying to save
everything possible.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I mean, you'd need a field of that
just to get an ounce, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I, you know, I use my Vitamix a lot
for just because I have the whole plant,
[SPEAKER_14]: excuse me, whole plant access.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's thick and it was quite
difficult to drink whole plant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So my growers sent me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Quite difficult, really.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would just put, I just.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adding to a smoothie though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, in small amounts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, I really do.
[SPEAKER_14]: What I do normally is just pour it through
a sieve.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, the plant matter,
which is quite difficult to digest.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the reasons it's great to build
with is, you know, just pouring it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no science behind this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, but that I really need to
ingest all that fiber, that cellulose.
[SPEAKER_14]: So.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think straining it seems perfectly
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I use the Vitamix as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it seems to work really well.
[SPEAKER_19]: If I, if I don't put a lot of buds in
there, if I put maybe like four or five
[SPEAKER_19]: buds in the, in the Vitamix and just wind
it up.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's real smooth and like water and it
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I like the Vitamix.
[SPEAKER_19]: With some hemp seed, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't strain the hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Put little terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe some, some roots, some burdock root,
some elderberries.
[SPEAKER_19]: Keep healthy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you have the juice bar going on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some apples and grapes and dates.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Apples and apples and cannabis are great
together.
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a big fan of carrot and ginger.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the, I love ginger.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ginger's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: The recipe section.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's got their favorites.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: The next show is a creative cooking on in
the Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_16]: If everybody makes their own, you know,
one they like, then somebody will make a
[SPEAKER_16]: Hash Church recipe book of actually,
you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that actually brings me to something
Etienne, which I will show you guys right
[SPEAKER_13]: now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So one, a gentleman hit me up not too long
ago and he said, listen, I've been
[SPEAKER_13]: watching you guys on Hash Church since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've totally gotten me.
[SPEAKER_13]: He jumped down this rabbit hole,
super inspired.
[SPEAKER_13]: I started, you know, learning how to grow
and had some failures and then had some
[SPEAKER_13]: successes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I started like, you know,
playing around with, with just crossing
[SPEAKER_13]: some plants and he, he, he made a cross
and he wanted to name it Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so he sent me this picture of the
plant and he said, yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's, it creates lots of resin and
the hash is really good and it dumps in
[SPEAKER_13]: the one, in the, in the 120 and in the 90
bag.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I wanted to give a shout out to
Mark who, who made this plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: which was the DNA kosher, DNA genetics
kosher sorbet crossed with Canuck cookies.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is a kosher kush crossed with a
sorbet to make one parent and then a OG
[SPEAKER_13]: kush crossed with a Durban poison to make
the other parent.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is the, potentially it's going
to be called the Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've got a little Canadian,
there's a little Canadian thing going on
[SPEAKER_15]: there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it's really cool that he,
that he hit us up and he sent me right
[SPEAKER_13]: away.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the beauty of living in Canada
right now is like, Hey, can I send you
[SPEAKER_13]: like some seeds of the Hash Church and
some, and some clones?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so he sent me a couple, but they
didn't really make it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't send them very in the,
in the best way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he sent, you know, I have to
actually go get the, the containers that
[SPEAKER_13]: he, that he sent these in because they
were so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like, he beef caked it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: First, he just sent them in those kind of
cheap little clone, you know, with the
[SPEAKER_13]: little light on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then he like made his own PVC piping,
drilled holes, put these little lights
[SPEAKER_13]: with a battery pack on each one and then
painted them up like a tattoo artist
[SPEAKER_13]: would.
[SPEAKER_13]: So best friend farms welcome, say hello
for two minutes while I go get these clone
[SPEAKER_13]: containers and interrupt you when I get
back and show you how ridiculous these
[SPEAKER_13]: are.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice frosty, frosty job there,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, great work on your soil biology.
[SPEAKER_19]: The trichome structure is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good job on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_15]: How many weeks was that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, did he hear us?
[SPEAKER_15]: Speak up.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to make this a little bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to show here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well we'll get them unmuted.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're not late at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm about to show these sick clone cases
that Mark made when he sent me the hash
[SPEAKER_13]: church cut.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just got to mute your mic there.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then this one too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of looks like prison taps.
[SPEAKER_13]: Man, it looks pretty cool in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't spent as much time in prison as
Sam has.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a tattoo artist for 25 years in
prison.
[SPEAKER_13]: In Chino, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pull them back toward you a little bit,
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's better.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to get my hand out of the way.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other sides are just... Well
done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So shout out to Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've given one... You're late,
right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I was pretty impressed with this
gift.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love living in Canada right now where we
can send each other clones.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's like it's not illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just it's absolutely incredible and
amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that it spreads all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And more importantly, I hope that everyone
that is currently in prison for cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: offenses gets let out like yesterday.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the last prisoners project that
Steve D'Angelo has been doing and a whole
[SPEAKER_13]: group of people that are involved with is
definitely worth checking into and looking
[SPEAKER_13]: into and giving support to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because while we're living in this sort of
mildly utopian world of cannabis being
[SPEAKER_13]: legal on this at least small level,
because I still hear plenty of people
[SPEAKER_13]: complaining about everything that's wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they forget about what it was like
to have their doors kicked in and their
[SPEAKER_13]: dogs shot and then taken off to prison.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I digress.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let's let those let's get those
folks out of prison who are in there for
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they can't stop asking for more,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Never.
Never.
[SPEAKER_16]: And give them jobs in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were in their stripes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's it's sad that there's places that
actually want to keep people from working
[SPEAKER_13]: in the cannabis industry that have
cannabis felonies.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, dude, that is a resume if I've
never seen one.
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_20]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out also shout out also to a farmer
and the felon there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Ned Dennis from Kana Craft are
working on that and they're supporting
[SPEAKER_02]: last prisoner project also.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're really trying to put the
farmer drug war veteran on a pedestal and
[SPEAKER_02]: to really recognize those rockers that
were earned and that farmer has and
[SPEAKER_02]: usually grows some of the best herb ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really remarkable work.
[SPEAKER_14]: They continue to.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wham's going to be having a little a
little spotlight with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it'll take a while before it gets
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not this month.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gatherings have definitely been kind of
put on hold.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, no one's really talking about it,
but talk about like a major hit to people
[SPEAKER_13]: who love getting together and enjoying
cannabis together, like a respiratory
[SPEAKER_13]: illness virus world pandemic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like not only can you not really are you
not supposed to even gather, but you can't
[SPEAKER_13]: do the very thing that we used to do,
which was get all together, puff lots of
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis and coffee in each other's faces.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just.
[SPEAKER_13]: Done.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but you know, we did, you know,
see live music where bands would be on a
[SPEAKER_15]: stage and people would be dancing and
yeah, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we had a 20 night and 20 year
overnight success story where we got
[SPEAKER_16]: deemed essential because we actually
fought back and got our rights to be equal
[SPEAKER_16]: and open.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was actually quite a Herculean
undertaking we did in California that now
[SPEAKER_16]: everybody else has been able to benefit
from.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, cannabis has been deemed
essential.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to use this post COVID to
actually fight back harder.
[SPEAKER_20]: I will say I was in the only state that
deemed recreational non-essential.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_20]: It really, you know, I think that
Massachusetts it's, it's brutal.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that that hindered a lot of
access.
[SPEAKER_20]: Was essential.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, this is also.
[SPEAKER_16]: This also is why you have to work hard
over the years and still maintain.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is where the grassroots,
where we had the support in California,
[SPEAKER_16]: we've maintained 20 years of working with
our representatives.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we called them, they, we got
responses.
[SPEAKER_16]: This shows the grassroots work that still
needs to be laid in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that, because we saw you try to fight
back, but you just didn't have the network
[SPEAKER_16]: that we add to, to rely on.
[SPEAKER_16]: So take this as a note that want to come
online, work within your state,
[SPEAKER_16]: local, and federal, because we got our
local authority in Berkeley, which forced
[SPEAKER_16]: the state to say, well, if Berkeley is
going to do it, then we're going to have
[SPEAKER_16]: to allow it in the state.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the Bay area caused the rest of
the state, which caused the rest of the
[SPEAKER_16]: nation.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you don't really need to take focus
after this and really get down to
[SPEAKER_16]: activating your people to get active with
your representatives, local state.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's, it's a totally different beast
out here.
[SPEAKER_20]: As you know, it's like, it's, it's
different than the California market.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think to your point, they,
they listen when it's, when it has to do
[SPEAKER_20]: with policy and they are open.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just going after it and putting it
together.
[SPEAKER_20]: As you're saying, I'm a hundred percent
behind it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's just important for,
you know, the not the whole conversation
[SPEAKER_20]: as, as a national conversation to be
brought together.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause it's, it's time.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's, you know, it's, we need to
have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that it needs to be put up to the
table in a real way.
[SPEAKER_20]: But like you're saying, it's, it's gotta
be policy driven.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just left my joint in the front of my
computer and I can feel the heat coming up
[SPEAKER_06]: from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can just see how all the residents
kind of melting into the joint now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of like activated it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Activated your joint.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Johnny, Johnny B tech right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Joint activation tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love the passion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love the passion for the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: And got my got melt shirt on today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, do you, do you got melt?
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to Stu.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to iced earth.
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to ask you, how's, how's
everything's going in the season?
[SPEAKER_20]: How's Maine going?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's going really well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_18]: So just been super busy out straight
harvesting vegetables left and right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the second depth session has just been
harvesting over the last week and into
[SPEAKER_18]: this next week.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, I had a great, great turn,
had high humidity this summer,
[SPEAKER_18]: but we fought through it with good vigor
and health and good living soil.
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, going really well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So some of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some, what are some of the crosses?
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm running a bunch of new gear this year
at the gas mask of first.
[SPEAKER_18]: So loving that one.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's our best hash plant period,
but it did really good in the depth and
[SPEAKER_18]: second depth turn even better.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a lot of Woodstock pharmacy gear
going this, this turn who's a local
[SPEAKER_18]: breeder up here in Maine.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've really promising results on that
route 26 that I posted recently.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, very, what I'm guessing is a
grape pie forward or Sunday driver,
[SPEAKER_18]: grape pie, Fino friendly, super great.
[SPEAKER_18]: Gassy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, my favorite plant in the depth right
now, the hybrid is a white haze from the
[SPEAKER_18]: swamp boys.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got three phenotypes and they're just
absolutely monstrous and amazing stacked
[SPEAKER_18]: up super greasy white.
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I understand it to be is a lot of
the 90, 95% plus likeability on the PIF
[SPEAKER_18]: side.
[SPEAKER_18]: For when I kind of went back when I
posted, that's the info I got back was
[SPEAKER_18]: what they were working with was heavy PIF.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm kind of new to that one,
but not new to haze.
[SPEAKER_20]: So New York city is a little faster
finisher.
[SPEAKER_20]: I used to run that pit, the New York city
PIF a lot, um, along the diesel,
[SPEAKER_20]: but it's, that's a cool one that that
having those jeans in there is going to
[SPEAKER_20]: be, I bet the taste is going to be just
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause that stuff is like, it looks like
power smoke.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I don't know how the hash will be on
it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I'm interested because the,
you know, the F one vigor to it and the
[SPEAKER_18]: formation it's, it's clustering up and
knuckling up with the, with the whitey is
[SPEAKER_18]: insane.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just insane arms stacked right up super
long.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that, that's, I can't wait to see
it, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: And hopefully come back.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the phenotypes is absolutely haze
forward.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to share them with you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you'd be real intrigued with those
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so haze haze is like, is turpentine,
which is like the Jack train wreck sage,
[SPEAKER_02]: Durbin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So PIF, I always heard of, I always heard
a PIF from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never smelled that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that smell?
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's very sweet.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really, it's like a sweet,
it's such a intense terpene sweet crunch
[SPEAKER_20]: berry with the haze in there.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's just, it's just like this sweet
haze.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's a very unique berry that yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's unmistakable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, it's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's why New York, like most of the
people that smoke cannabis in New York,
[SPEAKER_20]: their taste for the, for cannabis is so
heightened because of those varieties that
[SPEAKER_20]: have been grown in the, you know,
predominantly, you know, spread out
[SPEAKER_20]: through the city.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's, it's really an interesting
culture there.
[SPEAKER_20]: But that variety, if you can get it,
get your hands on that cut, it's,
[SPEAKER_20]: it's, it's a fast finishing haze that just
is just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's, it's a powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'd say it's the best way.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's, it's like picked up on the
haze, Collin, from what I remember back
[SPEAKER_18]: even out of Amsterdam or New York,
old school haze.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it just like, especially meeting the
white and this one, you know, of the
[SPEAKER_18]: three, that's obviously the piff heavy all
day is just like you said, so exotically
[SPEAKER_18]: pine berry, loud haze type.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's new to me too.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'm so pulled to it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't wait to check it out.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you, if you have to get you the piff,
but it's a, it's a beautiful variety.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's, you know, a lot of people,
it's very coveted, but it's at the same
[SPEAKER_20]: time, it's, it really reminds me of the
mango haze that guys, I think that's one
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to think of like a variety
that's accessible that people have all
[SPEAKER_20]: had.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, it's like the mango haze,
but more berry in there.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really interesting guys.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's, I'm super stoked for you
because the white also doesn't really,
[SPEAKER_20]: it could go either way with the white,
you know, in terms of, of this,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, the P one stock, but it's a
really well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I met really well with the white.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got some arms of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It are literally like the size of my arm
with clusters, like my fist right off it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that one's like the more gassy pine
versus the piffy, you know, which is that
[SPEAKER_18]: piffy, you know, is all big white kind of
cactus looking, talking like, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: 10, 12 inch coal is like three,
four inches wide in the depth.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can't touch it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just totally will grease your hand.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hands completely all out.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, it pays grease.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a really greasy hybrid.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: That sounds like her.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a new hybrid in there that I'm
looking out for hash to though,
[SPEAKER_18]: like got coming onto the indoor and back a
gas mask is a wood stock pharmacy gear
[SPEAKER_18]: also thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's called snow drift, which is the
old snow dog cross to a NAC, which is OG
[SPEAKER_18]: KB Mac.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I got this one phenotype that he's
just absolutely velvety grease snow dog
[SPEAKER_18]: forward all day.
[SPEAKER_18]: And just looks like the hash plant,
like legendary type.
[SPEAKER_20]: Did it pass any of the Mac terpene
profiles on?
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause I get some work with the Mac.
[SPEAKER_20]: I made an F2 of it and use it as a male in
it.
[SPEAKER_20]: It really passed a lot of the haze traits
on in terms of the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: The only, I've worked with it just a
little bit, but it's a, it seems to throw
[SPEAKER_20]: that, that terpenoline in the mix,
like predominantly in most of the
[SPEAKER_20]: phenomes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's actually pretty, pretty
interesting variety.
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you can go either way with that
one.
[SPEAKER_20]: I know a lot of people are either love it
or, or don't like it, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: but, uh, Big Sur Holy is a Big Sur Holy
weed out west.
[SPEAKER_18]: That one, I, that one crossed to an OG
when I was back up in Humboldt years ago
[SPEAKER_18]: was some of the loudest and friendliest,
like pleasant to smoke, um, rosin or a
[SPEAKER_18]: bubble hash like solventless, especially
was just absolutely standout favorite was
[SPEAKER_18]: the Big Sur Holy OG out west.
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember with same terpene family too.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been, uh, I've been doing,
we've been doing some phenol hunts lately
[SPEAKER_20]: and it's, it's been fun to, to see the new
terpene profiles that are happening.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some, some interesting like Jolly
Rancher style smells coming out.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, it's kind of profile out of,
uh, actually use those Jolly Rancher.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the name of the type.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, um, God, we did wedding cake
times Mac.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and that, that's interesting because
it has like a wedding cake kind of gas.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then when you, on the exhale,
you get the Mac and the terpenaline on the
[SPEAKER_20]: back end, which is, which is, which is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but yeah, that's, you know,
I've been really, really looking forward
[SPEAKER_20]: to trying new stuff out.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been also this lemon brulee washed,
uh, did about 60 pounds, washed 60 pounds
[SPEAKER_20]: of it.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um, it's, it's, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an interesting variety.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, it's the lemon G times can day like
him.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_20]: It kind of brings the lemon G profile into
a better return for hash, you know?
[SPEAKER_20]: So for the guys that are looking for the
lemon G profile that don't get the returns
[SPEAKER_20]: they're looking for off the lemon G,
I'd say to take a look at that,
[SPEAKER_20]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, I think that's COVID genetics.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, that, that makes those, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, did you say COVID?
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the name was I've never heard one of
the guys that I worked with at the
[SPEAKER_20]: facility, he's friends with them and he
was, he just, you know, he just showed me
[SPEAKER_20]: his work and I thought it was pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know, um, Geordie from the Dutch
consultant agency had run some stuff with
[SPEAKER_20]: his, you know, at Wilcox and he found some
success with it.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just, you know, I'm not always,
you know, so keen on just jumping into
[SPEAKER_20]: trying stuff, but you know, it seemed like
the right parent stock to, to go after the
[SPEAKER_20]: Fino hunt with to find something.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think they, they found, you know,
two Finos when they ran it and then kept
[SPEAKER_20]: the, you know, I think they're keeping
number five or something like that.
[SPEAKER_20]: I watched number nine and number five.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to try to look at the
numbers on that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, but it's, uh, it's interesting,
you know, like Fino hunting is like that
[SPEAKER_20]: black box.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, like you get in there and you
flick a little bit of light, it gets
[SPEAKER_20]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's like another light
flickers in the next corner over there and
[SPEAKER_20]: you're like, Ooh, look at that one.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Keepers not some, some don't make the,
make the cut.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we definitely saw some,
you know, a little bit of early mold on a
[SPEAKER_18]: few types that had to just get cut right
now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Even, uh, unfortunately, but we had some
great resistance actually.
[SPEAKER_18]: Showing on, I should share the 24 karat
gold cross with a Oni's trop cookie that I
[SPEAKER_18]: did.
[SPEAKER_18]: A friend gave me an F2 male Oni that trop
cookie like couple of years back.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I decided to use them because he was
powerhouse looking and colorful.
[SPEAKER_18]: And man, the resistance factor and even
Terp meeting, I got on the, uh,
[SPEAKER_18]: the trop cookie meets, uh, you know,
the kosher Tangi there went back to,
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a spread where one of the largest
throat, the largest yielder actually is
[SPEAKER_18]: just watermelon, papaya all day,
like super, super watermelon, jolly
[SPEAKER_18]: rancher forward.
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you run the ZomZom crosses at all?
[SPEAKER_20]: The watermelon stuff that became the,
you know, a lot of stuff that became the
[SPEAKER_20]: watermelon skittles, I guess, and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't, I heard about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was assuming.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_20]: Very watermelon-esque, but that's what it
reminds me of.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a really interesting variety.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the second watermelon turp I've
found actually.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that's I've heard of the gear you're
talking about, but I haven't tried it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I've found watermelon over three
years.
[SPEAKER_18]: I brought back a strawberry fields that
was crossed to a forum cut from that I
[SPEAKER_18]: bred out West.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we could just got, or what was it
forum cut to, yeah, strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was just all day.
[SPEAKER_18]: We called it strawberry frost cookies,
but it was watermelon forward.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now this one, the 24k trop cookie meets
it's a little bit more papaya friendly,
[SPEAKER_18]: but watermelon, same watermelon turp.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hard to believe how similar to the other
one it is even for watermelon.
[SPEAKER_20]: On these papayas like is to me,
like legend.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just like his pinnacle that,
that papaya, I would always search that
[SPEAKER_20]: out.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a, it's, that profile is just
special.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really, really delicious to enjoyable
experience to have.
[SPEAKER_20]: I want it, since you were talking about
funeral homes, I was thinking about Sam
[SPEAKER_20]: and, you know, he's probably grown more
plants than any of us in our entire lives.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was curious to ask Sam, you know,
what varieties and what part of the world
[SPEAKER_20]: were those varieties from that really that
you've seen that produced the right type
[SPEAKER_20]: of heads for water hash.
[SPEAKER_20]: And like, is there any, anything that
you've ever done that's looked at that
[SPEAKER_20]: type of stuff?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about doing it with a water
shifting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it matters though.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it works for dry sifting, like if it's
a great strain for dry sifting,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to get Sam to still answer
your question, because if you ask him in
[SPEAKER_13]: regards to water hash, he's going to say,
I'm not the best person to ask that
[SPEAKER_13]: question to.
[SPEAKER_13]: You ask him from a dry sift standpoint.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: So from a sifting standpoint or an
extraction standpoint that you prefer.
[SPEAKER_10]: In general, to be honest, Afghan Indica
widely varieties actually have bigger
[SPEAKER_10]: heads of resin and the plants are actually
bred to produce resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't care if it's on the flowers,
the leaves, the whatever, but you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: lots and lots of resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a problem, of course,
with these widely varieties in Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_10]: and places like this, is they're not all
tea and THC because 25% of them are high
[SPEAKER_10]: in THC only, 25% of them are high in CBD
only, and 15% of them have a blend of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: So because they're bred and selected for
resin and the farmers aren't smoking
[SPEAKER_10]: individual plants, it's happened over
generations and generations and
[SPEAKER_20]: generations.
[SPEAKER_20]: And they would sieve that and then just
like mix them together and then press
[SPEAKER_20]: that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that kind of how they would do it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, people are mostly growing and people
are seeing mostly today are polyhybrids
[SPEAKER_10]: between widely and narrowly equatorial and
Middle Eastern.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they can find some with really nice
terpene selections and really nice head
[SPEAKER_10]: size and lots of heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I mean, if you want lots of hash,
you've got to have lots of heads,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's where it starts.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the countries that have traditional
hash, like West Bengal, many places in
[SPEAKER_10]: India, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam,
Laos, all those countries, they all have
[SPEAKER_10]: traditional integration.
[SPEAKER_10]: Integrated hash, I mean, excuse me,
ganja business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they produced fantastic marijuana at
the top end of the scale.
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's good info, man.
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, what do you know about alpha pining?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in our data, what we see at SC
Labs is whenever it's present or dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: in a profile without myrcene, because it's
usually a tertiary terpene to myrcene,
[SPEAKER_02]: tertiary or secondary, but it's rarely
like codominant or dominant without
[SPEAKER_02]: myrcene being present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we see it like less than like three,
four percent of the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of actually alpha pining dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had heard that that terpene kind of
came in through hemp lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you know anything?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think what's found mostly in hemp
itself, not hybrid hemp, modern hemp
[SPEAKER_10]: that's bred for CBD with THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hemp was myrcene and teriopoly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those were the two big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I've always seen myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, just pining itself is just such
an interesting term to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've very rarely seen it actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, pining is one that potentiates THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in my mind, it also makes it slightly
fuzzier.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not really clear potentiation.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it does potentiate THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a paper I'll share with Marcus
that I'd love to share with the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's around pining when together with
THC helps to decrease the negative memory
[SPEAKER_02]: impairment effects THC has on short term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I'm super curious on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've totally said this before.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's that equivalent of taking
the walk through the forest and clearing
[SPEAKER_13]: your head.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait to read that paper,
dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll find that right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: What a joy it is to gather with you all on
the Sunday morning, Sunday afternoon,
[SPEAKER_13]: Sunday evening for some of you in
particular.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been, I don't know if it's been
months or how long it's been.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's been definitely some months
before we sort of chilled out and did a
[SPEAKER_13]: little hash church.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's been a bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate your guys' time, you know,
coming and hanging out and chilling and
[SPEAKER_13]: shooting the shit during this global
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is a way to see people across,
even that live in our own town.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Josh.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You grew a long beard.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I did.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_14]: Barbers are hard to get to these days.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, me too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that you can see.
[SPEAKER_14]: I dropped my computer in my phone,
my video.
[SPEAKER_14]: My camera doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_14]: I should drop it again, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, Josh.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't blame this on the barber though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's style too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for all the insights and the
communication and the connection.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty, pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And especially during this time when we
are so separated, but we don't become
[SPEAKER_14]: divided too distant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to Hash Church, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been a, this is great insights in
church more than I've got as a kid,
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of different conversations.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did have my first out of the body
experience at a high mass when I was quite
[SPEAKER_14]: young.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have to have more on that on another
show.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you about one of my first out of
body experiences and it did not happen at
[SPEAKER_13]: church.
[SPEAKER_14]: The second didn't.
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, welcome, Josh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going good, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just, you know, getting into it
here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Talking terpenes, talking flavonoids,
talking cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just talking all about the things that we
seem to geek out on pretty big as we get
[SPEAKER_13]: deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole
that is the cannabis community dash
[SPEAKER_13]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for inviting me to Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was mentioning earlier to Marcus,
I'm really stoked to kind of have Josh on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for once always been a great honor to
be part of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really, really grateful for the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, it was, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I was just getting a haircut at
get faded barbershop and I was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Hash Church YouTube up and cause
I was watching and I got one of our,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was off and the guy that was cutting my
hair was actually big up in Marcus and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a fellow hash maker himself as a
barber also.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just thought that was a funny
anecdote.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but yeah, this is, this has been a
really trippy year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and on the testing side of it,
you know, SC labs, this is, this is our
[SPEAKER_02]: 10th year testing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really stoked for, for Josh to
join today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, we've been doing some kind
of, you know, a bit of diving and like
[SPEAKER_02]: investigative journalism in a bit of a
way, kind of, you know, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with identifying trends as they're
happening kind of in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: like like the licensed testing market,
you know, as certain things are popping or
[SPEAKER_02]: trends are happening, you know,
we're, we're kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, we're, we're in it to try to help
identify the issue and then overcome to
[SPEAKER_02]: help our, you know, people that we work
with to, to overcome these, these issues
[SPEAKER_02]: that we see, you know, oftentimes coming
from outside cannabis supply chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so Josh actually just authored a
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put out a public service announcement
to all the, all those we serve around kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of this batch of contaminated pre-roll
cones, like the pre-rolled cone papers
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's commercial sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's a consumer sources you get
through head shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so we saw this, this trend in
some, some, some, you know, a trend of
[SPEAKER_02]: about five or six groups failing for
organophosphate chlorpyrifos in rolling,
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling in pre-roll, pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and really quickly we identified it
was paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started, we, we basically dug in
kind of and did a pretty wide consumer and
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial rolling paper and blunt wrap
kind of testing and report.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Josh kind of was just, you know,
just compiled all that and, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: just wanted to kind of step it up for you,
Josh, if you'd be down to share some.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, yeah, Alex said it pretty good.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we, we had a couple, a cluster of,
of, of pre-rolls fail.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and we knew that the, the material
that had gotten to him was clean.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so, you know, kind of digging in,
like Alex said, we, we, we traced it back
[SPEAKER_17]: to the, the, the cones.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the, the, the funny thing is when we,
when we went and actually did a study of,
[SPEAKER_17]: of, of multiple rolling paper brands,
we didn't find a lot of that pesticide in
[SPEAKER_17]: the, in, in, in the brands that we tested.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, it seems like it,
it was a, you know, kind of, it's a batch
[SPEAKER_17]: by batch issue, but, but this,
this, you know, these failures sort of
[SPEAKER_17]: precipitated the study we did.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and so we went and, you know,
kind of got, pulled out any, any type of
[SPEAKER_17]: rolling paper product we get our hands on,
I think got about 120.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, not surprisingly,
you know, paper has trace levels of metals
[SPEAKER_17]: and sometimes trace levels of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, all of these papers come from,
you know, organics or, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: plant-based sources.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's not surprising to find metals
in plants.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and, you know, there's not,
you know, it, it wasn't, it wasn't a story
[SPEAKER_17]: of kind of, you know, rolling papers are
all grossly contaminated, but we certainly
[SPEAKER_17]: did find some instances of, of really
contaminated rolling papers that,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, if I was a, you know,
pre-roll manufacturer for sure,
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd want to be cognizant of, you know,
and, and, and certainly, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: if I was a consumer, I'd kind of want to
know, you know, some of these,
[SPEAKER_17]: but, but anyway, so, so for the most part,
you know, rolling papers are, weren't,
[SPEAKER_17]: weren't, were relatively clean,
but in a small portion of the samples we
[SPEAKER_17]: found, you know, hundreds of times the
allowable limits in California for,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, things like lead.
[SPEAKER_17]: And in other heavy metals, and then,
and then in some of the rolling papers we
[SPEAKER_17]: found, you know, enough pesticide where I
would be concerned if I was a pre-roll
[SPEAKER_17]: manufacturer that in states like
California, I might actually fail a
[SPEAKER_17]: compliance batch test because just
because- What were the levels,
[SPEAKER_15]: what were the levels of the pesticide
you've seen?
[SPEAKER_17]: In pesticides, so it depends on the
pesticide, but, you know, in some,
[SPEAKER_17]: in some instances we were seeing,
you know, seven, seven or eight times the
[SPEAKER_17]: allowable limit in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you had, you know, in, in,
it seemed to be, it seemed to be certainly
[SPEAKER_17]: the, the, the one product category that
was really kind of concerning was
[SPEAKER_17]: cellulose-based rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we only happened to have three
cellulose-based rolling papers in our
[SPEAKER_17]: sample size, sample size of like 120
samples.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't have a really good sample size
to draw from, but, and I can pull it up
[SPEAKER_17]: really quick here, but in, in two of the
three, all three of them failed for,
[SPEAKER_17]: or would have, I say failed, would have
failed in California had they been
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: For an inhalable cannabis product,
but two of the three had hundreds of times
[SPEAKER_17]: the allowable limit of lead.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, and then, yeah, and then some of
the, some of the, the sort of wraps were
[SPEAKER_17]: also kind of the other product category
that was, you know, had some significant
[SPEAKER_17]: contamination in it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't see a lot of contamination in
the actual rolling papers themselves,
[SPEAKER_17]: the kind of hemp-based or the fiber-based
rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly some, you know, some trace
detections in one or two that were,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, kind of would approach
California action.
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, you know, a rolling paper only
constitutes a small portion of,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, thousands of PPMs, tens of PPMs.
[SPEAKER_15]: What were the, so what was the
concentration regime?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cellulose ones were around,
I want to say like kind of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: they absolutely blew our kind of high
calibrations, but it was, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: look in excess of 50 part per million of
lead, you know, in the cellulose,
[SPEAKER_02]: like clear roll type papers that,
you know, I mean, there's aren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not super big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I used to smoke those,
you know, cause it was unique and
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting cause you could see through it
when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, but yeah, we saw the
chlorpyrifos issue was largely kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, within this commercial source
of, of rolling paper cones, pre-rolled
[SPEAKER_02]: cones, you know, cause it seems like
there's a few factories in the world that
[SPEAKER_02]: make these, you know, from one in
Czechoslovakia.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what was the level of chlorpyrifos?
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that just like about 10 PPM or?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was like, you know,
kind of between like 300 part per billion
[SPEAKER_02]: to like a part per million, you know,
at, whereas, whereas about 30 part per
[SPEAKER_02]: billion is a fail for a cannabis product
in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so essentially people were taking
these, you know, these highly contaminated
[SPEAKER_02]: cones and then diluting the pesticide with
clean cannabis that then was still kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: creating fails because of how much,
you know, pesticide was in the paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like Josh was saying,
besides that, you know, a lot of what we
[SPEAKER_02]: were seeing then was in the thicker ply
type of, you know, kind of cones or nut
[SPEAKER_02]: cone, sorry, the hemp and, you know,
tobacco kind of blunt wrap type,
[SPEAKER_02]: type products.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I just pulled it up.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, cipramethrin was,
was an issue with, it just seemed like one
[SPEAKER_17]: brand of wraps.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had three of them and all three of them
hit for cipramethrin well over the actual
[SPEAKER_17]: limit.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like, yeah, between two and seven
parts per million, one part per million
[SPEAKER_17]: would be the actual limit in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, over, I mean, not,
not, you know, nothing I'd be you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: overly concerned with unless I was a
manufacturer who was trying to,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, not fail a batch test.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, as a consumer, it's not,
you know, grossly contaminated,
[SPEAKER_17]: but yeah, the cellulose based rolling
papers, like Alex said, they were,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, between 60 and 50, one was 60,
one was 55 parts per million for lead.
[SPEAKER_17]: And in California, just to give you kind
of a background, the actual limit is 50
[SPEAKER_17]: parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I misspoke, they were a thousand times,
they're a thousand times over the actual
[SPEAKER_17]: limit.
[SPEAKER_17]: So.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you know, based on what you're
telling me, I wonder if those compounds
[SPEAKER_15]: are actually applied to containers for
pest control, you know, cause they want
[SPEAKER_15]: that shit coming over from China.
[SPEAKER_15]: What they do is they just broadcast pest,
pesticide XYZ over containers and in
[SPEAKER_15]: shipping areas that again, are not very
segregated on, you know, and what's not,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, those are really, really low
level, levels of those compounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, yeah, you don't want to see any of
those things in your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: but when you're measuring stuff at the,
at the part per billion level,
[SPEAKER_15]: remember this conversation, Alec,
like taking a lint brush to New York city
[SPEAKER_15]: sidewalk, you're going to find everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you start looking at, we looked
at, what was that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Backwoods, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: We went and took Backwoods and found out
they had Roundup and all kinds of shit in
[SPEAKER_15]: there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, just background exposure.
[SPEAKER_15]: We live in a chemically contaminated
world, Josh.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, what's the likelihood that this is
actually either applied during the paper
[SPEAKER_15]: making process, or like I said,
maybe more accurately applied in a pest
[SPEAKER_15]: control kind of way that had nothing to do
with the cellulose or nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_15]: the factory that made the.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the two different things,
the cellulose based rolling, the cellulose
[SPEAKER_17]: rolling papers were lead.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that came from kind of probably
whatever was in the fiber, the cellulose
[SPEAKER_17]: source that they used to produce these,
or it was coming from really kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: poorly designed equipment.
[SPEAKER_17]: If people, wherever these papers are
produced, if the machine just had lead
[SPEAKER_17]: parts, I mean, that happens all the time
in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not, but what was the level of lead
again?
[SPEAKER_17]: 60 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a ton of lead.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a ton.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lot of lead, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: But with the pesticides, yeah,
like in pesticides weren't a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like these three for cipramethrin,
I mean, that's enough where it wasn't
[SPEAKER_17]: like, you know, didn't probably didn't get
picked up from somewhere, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_17]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_17]: It could have been fumigated.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think anyone is applying
pesticides to the papers, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: or maybe the hemp source, but I,
you know, industrial hemp, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, they, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to make guesses, but,
and then we had a couple that tested
[SPEAKER_17]: positive for chlorpyrifos, but not in the
levels we saw that in sort of the samples
[SPEAKER_17]: that precipitated the study in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, these, you know, these could have
been, you know, stored in a facility that
[SPEAKER_17]: was fumigated or, you know, there's lots
of ways these contaminations can reach the
[SPEAKER_17]: product.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the cellulose papers,
I would say like, yeah, if I was,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, this is sort of a consumer,
you know, consumer safety issue,
[SPEAKER_17]: and these particular samples that we
tested, I, you know, I would not want to
[SPEAKER_17]: consume certainly, and I wouldn't
recommend people do, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: yeah, like I said, the amount of
cipramethrin even in these blunt wraps
[SPEAKER_17]: that, you know, we're well over the actual
limit in California, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, by the time you put cannabis in
it, I mean, I don't know, I'm not an
[SPEAKER_17]: epidemiologist, but I wouldn't personally
be, you know, overly concerned about this
[SPEAKER_17]: myself as a consumer, but certainly as a
manufacturer of pre-rolled products,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, I think it's just something,
you know, it's something we identified as
[SPEAKER_17]: another, you know, another thing,
another input that manufacturers should be
[SPEAKER_17]: aware of is another example of,
you know, you gotta check all your inputs,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, with the regulations we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and if I may real quick on that,
you have, so, and just to give a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more context, you know, public service
announcement less on like how public
[SPEAKER_02]: health scare, but it was more sending out
to, you know, all the clients that we work
[SPEAKER_02]: with in California as a source that has
been, you know, kind of identified
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing in, you know, failures,
you know, 3000, you know, batch,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, product batches, you know,
kind of your final finished product in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 3000, pre-rolls or what have
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so we're kind of putting it out
more in like an insight to help kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: navigate and eliminate potential fail,
you know, and that's what we do a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause you know, cause you know,
across all these tests and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally understand what you're saying,
Mark, you know, like there's such tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: action limits, but you know, I would,
you know, be that as it may, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we only see one to 2% fail rate across all
compliance testing, you know, so even as
[SPEAKER_02]: strict as these standards are,
we've been pretty fucking good,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know cannabis is being proudly
touted as cleaner than food or cleaner
[SPEAKER_02]: than water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and so, and so we're just held at a
different, we're held at a different level
[SPEAKER_02]: of scrutiny and we were able to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to be, have you guys ever done any
non-cannabis testing other than these
[SPEAKER_15]: papers?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I was thinking more in terms of like,
you know, uh, you know, everyone was
[SPEAKER_15]: concerned with the vape pen manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you have to have the
instrumentation and experts like Josh to
[SPEAKER_15]: run it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not something trivial,
like you could run other kinds of tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and if I'm in that, I'd love Josh to
kind of, you know, kind of jump in cause
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, we're even, we, we got smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just on mute, but no, but I just,
I just wanted to make a point about supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause cause what we find, we find
ourselves in this position where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: helping all those that we serve be,
you know, qualify their inputs beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you know, cause cannabis is a
massive phyto-remediator bio-accumulator
[SPEAKER_02]: on its own, you know, but, but we're also
helping them vet all these other supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain sources that they're going to be
adding something to cannabis, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a rolling paper, whether it's raw cacao to
make chocolates, you know, we come to come
[SPEAKER_02]: to find out raw, you know, cacao is a
phyto-remediator of cadmium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's grown around mountainous
regions in the world, like the Andes,
[SPEAKER_02]: then, then the percentage of cacao that
you do a dark chocolate, the higher the
[SPEAKER_02]: chance that you're going to fail for,
you know, a cannabis test because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cadmium source of cacao, you know,
and same thing with qualifying essential
[SPEAKER_02]: oils, you know, so it's almost like
there's the wrapper that you're wrapping
[SPEAKER_15]: that cannabis product in, you know,
every, all the packaging, everything that
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis is, everything that the product
touches.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Has an analytical quality component that
you guys and probably other labs too,
[SPEAKER_15]: are just trying to get their hands around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, like putting live
resin, super high terpene rich extracts
[SPEAKER_02]: into a jar and having a styrofoam insert
kind of at the top that seals it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see the terpene ring around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxide from the polyethylene plastic,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so yeah, so there's all these
sources, you know, but I'll let Josh jump
[SPEAKER_02]: in on the heavy metal side, but,
but you know, it's, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating because it's, we're just
seeing these consumer trends of within
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the testing market, you know,
of all these inputs that are other than
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, but I really see this like
glimmer of hope that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the scrutiny that we're held to now is why
can't food or every other industry qualify
[SPEAKER_02]: to these standards, especially when,
when stoners are put to it, we are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of make it with, you know,
one to 2% fail rate, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even as strict as the standards are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, don't underestimate what a stoner
could do with an HPLC.
[SPEAKER_13]: And amen to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always say that food and, you know,
like when people are like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis shouldn't be regulated like this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, look at our food.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, yeah, it's killing you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like at an accelerated rate, like the food
is killing people right now, the water,
[SPEAKER_13]: the air quality.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would just add before Josh says what
he's going to say is that these calyx
[SPEAKER_13]: containers are the first container that I
actually saw taking into account the
[SPEAKER_13]: terpenes consuming the plastic.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is like a, you know, I don't know
if it's PTFE or what it is, but they,
[SPEAKER_13]: he had told me originally, this is
basically non-consumed by terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a thin little layer and it fits
right inside the cap.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't even see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Calyx containers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty cool little containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding all industries to a new standard
that are going to come work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I've never seen anything
before Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't have too much to add other
than you mentioned the vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it just, you know, it's been,
you know, it's been a bit of a
[SPEAKER_17]: whack-a-mole as we, as we, you know,
at least with us in California,
[SPEAKER_17]: as we've gone through the regulations,
you know, just identifying, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: a lot of things that, you know,
people just didn't think, think about
[SPEAKER_17]: before, before anyone was kind of looking
for the contaminants.
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we started doing heavy metal
testing, that was one of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: that was one of the sources of
contamination that popped up right away.
[SPEAKER_17]: All of a sudden, you know, we switched
over to metals testing and there weren't a
[SPEAKER_17]: lot of labs or a lot of customers that
were that interested in, in doing metals
[SPEAKER_17]: testing before it was required.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it came as a bit of a surprise to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: And as soon as, you know, kind of the
regulations flipped and if you're not from
[SPEAKER_17]: California, we sort of implemented our
regulations in sort of tiered fashion.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the metals testing was sort of the
last tier of testing that was required.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, immediately all of a sudden
everyone realized that, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: the majority of vape cartridges on the
market were failing for lead because like
[SPEAKER_17]: you said, they're the, the manufacturers
of the actual cartridges were,
[SPEAKER_17]: were, were using lead in, in, in the,
in the wicks, I believe.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, but it was, it was one of those
things that is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_17]: And solder and that's, and that's a big
source of contamination in a lot of,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, a lot of manufacturing things.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about papers earlier that
those are the type of places where it
[SPEAKER_15]: enters, but, but solder is defined by a
certain percentage of lead, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I'm not an electrical person,
but I think that a solder is just an alloy
[SPEAKER_15]: of lead tin and a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So as soon as you hear solder,
you're like, Oh yeah, test that shit for
[SPEAKER_15]: lead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're making any type of food
grade, food grade equipment, you need to
[SPEAKER_17]: use special lead free solder.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's one of those, one of those
things that often gets overlooked.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, but then as soon as, you know,
as soon as we were doing the testing,
[SPEAKER_17]: it took, you know, it took a matter of
weeks to, to kind of spool up these
[SPEAKER_17]: factories to produce new cartridges using
a, I guess, a different solder formula.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, it happened over Chinese new
years and most of these are produced in
[SPEAKER_17]: China.
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was a little bit of a delay
because of the holiday.
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember that was, that was stressful
times, but, you know, within a matter of
[SPEAKER_17]: weeks, people were able to get cartridges
that could pass back out on the market.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and it just kind of goes to show that
with a lot of these testing regulations,
[SPEAKER_17]: we do a lot of testing of, of organic
produce, you know, when you're talking
[SPEAKER_17]: about kind of what's in the food,
you know, in, in, in, I guess with food,
[SPEAKER_17]: you have the choice of going organic,
but even still we, we test a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: organic produce because we use,
you know, like lettuce or, or spinach as,
[SPEAKER_17]: as, as sort of blanks for some of our
tests and things like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're just trying to get pesticide
free.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's really hard to do even with
organics because, you know, just drift
[SPEAKER_17]: from other farms and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just really hard to identify sources
of contamination, unless you're actually
[SPEAKER_17]: doing batch testing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just, it just falls on the labs
like us to, you know, to help,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, help guide that conversation and
push for common sense regulation where
[SPEAKER_17]: testing doesn't become a burden and people
see it as sort of, you know, I guess one
[SPEAKER_17]: of the value adds of, of, of purchasing
cannabis on the, on the, on the regulated
[SPEAKER_17]: market is, is, is that, you know,
that there's a quality control that goes
[SPEAKER_17]: into it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, there's testing that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and, you know, as long as we can keep
doing that and not be too burdensome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Josh, Josh, here's a question I just love
to ask.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're probably one of the only people
in the world who could answer this was
[SPEAKER_15]: having the knowledge and experience that
you've had, which is that if there are
[SPEAKER_15]: lead components in the solder and if the
cannabis oil inside a vape cartridge comes
[SPEAKER_15]: in contact, is the, is there, I mean,
I understand chemistry at the molecular
[SPEAKER_15]: basis, but I, I don't really know it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a sizable leaching of the lead
into the cannabis oil?
[SPEAKER_15]: So now what you're vaporizing,
what you're, so yeah, there's lead inside
[SPEAKER_15]: the, the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just, you know, get over that fact,
but what you're actually vaporizing,
[SPEAKER_15]: does that actually contain lead and do you
have data to say like how long the
[SPEAKER_15]: lifetime of an oil in a cartridge that
contains lead should be?
[SPEAKER_15]: So like, maybe they could just put an
expiration date.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the longer, say like a cartridge sits
around, the more lead leaches into the oil
[SPEAKER_15]: till it reaches a certain level.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: It definitely leaches into the oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause that's, you know, that's what we're
testing for, for our testing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, and so when, when, when they were
putting lead into these cartridges,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, that's what we were seeing it is
in the actual oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: And certainly the longer they sit,
the more chance there is for that lead to
[SPEAKER_17]: leach.
[SPEAKER_17]: But lead isn't super, isn't going to be
soluble in the oil very well.
[SPEAKER_17]: What we saw more is the source of
contamination is, is sort of how the
[SPEAKER_17]: cartridges were produced.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause that was still early, early days of
producing cartridges.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think at the time, most people were
still putting them together by hand.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, we would open up a
cartridge and you would see in the oil,
[SPEAKER_17]: you would see like it looked like glitter,
like little metal flex just from,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, that whoever put that cartridge
together, put, use a little too much force
[SPEAKER_17]: or, you know, just bad workmanship and
sort of metal, metal was kind of flaking
[SPEAKER_17]: off into the material.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think in general too, it was just
kind of early on in the process and bad
[SPEAKER_17]: quality control.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that, that played a large part in it
too, is it just seemed, it seemed how the
[SPEAKER_08]: cartridges were.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like acid form metals, oxide coating on
the surface of say your solder,
[SPEAKER_15]: because a lot of times a lot of these
metals will form oxides because when they
[SPEAKER_15]: react with air, like a Statue of Liberty
is a perfect example, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: That green color and the Statue of
Liberty, that's copper oxide because the
[SPEAKER_15]: oxide is basically corroded over the
years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically the oxide is what's
covering.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you could imagine that, yes,
that THCA and other acidic components and
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis oil extracts that go inside pen
cartridges could now make a soluble metal
[SPEAKER_15]: complex.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now what's being, so what's being
vaporized, I'm not really so worried about
[SPEAKER_15]: all these metal particulates in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be more worried about some sort of
lead THCA salt that's vaporized that I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: taking in my lungs, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we don't speciate the metals and
mercury is a lot like that too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mercury is, and it's not one we've seen in
cartridges, but mercury is volatile.
[SPEAKER_17]: But elemental mercury isn't as toxic as,
it's not the toxic species of mercury when
[SPEAKER_17]: compared to things like the organic
species of mercury.
[SPEAKER_17]: So those dynamics all play a large part in
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we don't have good data on the vapor.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we actually just recently,
we got a vaporizing, a vaping robot
[SPEAKER_17]: essentially where we can now vaporize
these pens.
[SPEAKER_17]: You stick the pens in it, it has a little
finger that can touch the button.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so you can play with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that goes right into the GC?
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: We capture the vapor and then we inject it
right into the GC or the ICP.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we first started kind of with the
organics, but we're working right now with
[SPEAKER_17]: metals analysis of the vapor.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's actually something we've
been working on.
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe- Yeah, I'd love to see you guys
back up those findings from what Robert
[SPEAKER_15]: Strong in on degradation to what a choline
and benzene and all that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a lot of hand waving about
some of the degradation chemistry that
[SPEAKER_15]: happens on dabbing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, those guys got a lot of PR about
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's some studies and I wanted to
try to go reproduce that in my lab,
[SPEAKER_15]: but you need one of those cigarette
smoking machines, which I just don't have.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, we're doing it to share the
results.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll let you know what we find out,
but that's actually our next project right
[SPEAKER_17]: now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the funny, I won't say the
funny thing, but the ironic thing is that
[SPEAKER_15]: again, people, I think, I mean,
people love vape pens.
[SPEAKER_15]: They just love the convenience of it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when COVID kind of came around,
it was also one of those things where the
[SPEAKER_15]: whole communal aspect of cannabis use,
passing a joint was just not happening
[SPEAKER_15]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone was doing their own personal
vaporizer, their own personal thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so again, I get asked questions about
this all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about all these pen parts from China?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they made in factories full of people
with COVID?
[SPEAKER_15]: And another question I'm asked all the
time that I don't know if you guys have
[SPEAKER_15]: any experience with, but can plant
material be a vector for virus transfer?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if people are sick in a grow,
can they contaminate plant materials so
[SPEAKER_15]: that that plant material is dangerous?
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as I know, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the virus on surfaces, I don't think
there's any proof that it lasted longer
[SPEAKER_10]: than a few days.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think it's pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the way that people get this is by
breathing the air that other people are
[SPEAKER_15]: breathing or contaminating.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or touching it with their hands and then
rubbing their faces.
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing I can tell you though is outdoor
cannabis would have much less chance of
[SPEAKER_17]: transmitting COVID without the UV
exposure.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's another plug for outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this would be a great group to ask
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some paper or somebody post
something that I didn't look into,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I thought it was even just some fake
news or something, but smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: had some effect in minimizing COVID
exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that totally BS?
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a couple of studies.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's people who are really thinking
their teeth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a group up in British Columbia
up by Marcus that published that CBD does
[SPEAKER_15]: seem to inhibit the enzyme that required
for COVID to take hold in the body.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just sort of like a layman's way of
describing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's a couple of groups that yeah,
are now showing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: On last past church, when we had it last
time and the very same question was asked,
[SPEAKER_15]: there was a YouTube published by an
Israeli guy who had no data whatsoever to
[SPEAKER_15]: say that it's effective to treat or
prevent COVID.
[SPEAKER_15]: But since then, there's been a lot of
people looking at it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The alternative cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: CBG and CBD too as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to Arjun from Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's rocking some COVID-19 right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he's in day nine or 10.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been doing updates on his Instagram,
doing the sort of healthy walk in the
[SPEAKER_13]: forest in the morning, stay away from
people, but saying he's getting real
[SPEAKER_13]: tired.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess yesterday it said that he kind
of had a turn for the worse and was
[SPEAKER_13]: feeling pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_13]: So send positive vibes to Arjun.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the famous grower, Rob Carney,
who is from Crested Butte, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_15]: who's known for the puck and known for
hash plants and a few other things.
[SPEAKER_15]: He successfully knocked on wood,
had COVID and was successfully treated.
[SPEAKER_15]: He was on the respirator.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of us thought we were going to see
him again, but he pulled through.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I'm starting to learn of
more and more people that I know that
[SPEAKER_15]: weren't so lucky.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, wish him the best and anyone else.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really met a ton of people or
know a ton of people that are cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: daily inhalers.
[SPEAKER_13]: That have gotten it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've only heard of maybe a few and the
ones that did didn't seem to have very bad
[SPEAKER_13]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, someone asked me, I think it was
Mark McCoy actually from Vriptec asked me
[SPEAKER_13]: and I had to think about it and was like,
come to think about it now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I'll ask that question to all of
you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys know any daily inhalers that
have been negatively affected?
[SPEAKER_13]: By COVID-19?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than Rob.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark McCoy.
[SPEAKER_15]: The people I know, I know a guy who
passed, but he was already, he already had
[SPEAKER_15]: COPD.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he already had lung issues.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess was more susceptible to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost done.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got about 14 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all again for coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the last 20 years, I've only gotten the
flu once or twice for a day or two at the
[SPEAKER_10]: most.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, I, my wife always said it was
because I smoke so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe you didn't get the plague
when we were all in Barcelona together.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every single person in that apartment,
but you got the plague.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, even, even I didn't feel great for
about one day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, did your wife not end up in the
hospital with that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you seemed like you wanted to go to
the hospital.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was so sick, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that went on for weeks when I got
home.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never felt anything like it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was beyond horrible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Too many people too close and the ultimate
is sharing pipes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I got it at that huge party at
that palace that advanced nutrients
[SPEAKER_13]: through.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you went there,
but no, I went there with you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's, that's where I think I picked
it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw his mic-ness very early in the
evening.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a huge palace though.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was, uh, yeah, he knows how to waste
money.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess if you got it, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to the palace, get the plague.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a, there's a story in there for
you.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you didn't catch it, don't be
hypnotized by great wealth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to lead you to early death.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll be buried well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be buried so well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Golden caskets for everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gem encrusted.
[SPEAKER_13]: What a waste.
[SPEAKER_13]: Feeding people that are starving.
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be a good start.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Donate your body to science.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I have been donating my body to
science for like the last 48 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why let it end at your death?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been my whole life.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, you know, cannabis has never been
more important than this time of COVID,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's on its way from,
you know, I mean, just in such like,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like miraculous, like serendipitous
timing, just shifting from felony to
[SPEAKER_02]: public central service, you know,
in this time of COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody would have just been
wiped out, you know, that's been working,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just working to, you know,
build and, you know, and so I can't help
[SPEAKER_02]: but to feel, you know, through this time
of COVID and as the economic impact really
[SPEAKER_02]: is felt nationally, you know, I feel like
it's cannabis and hemp is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly progressed to strategic national
global resource, you know, in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a huge way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said homegrown.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to grow more.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to grow a lot more
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there's going to be a lot more
growing at home and around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I felt like the apocalypse is a
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, everybody's freaking
out that the, you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking out like we're in the apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's all hell, you know, kind of,
you know, doom to day fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although we're in deep state of
suffering in this earth and just
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that's happening and the amount
of immense human suffering is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I can't, I can't help but to feel,
you know, the root, the root of the word
[SPEAKER_02]: apocalypse means the time of revelation or
the great unveiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like we're in that time,
you know, just faith in institutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: faith in all trust, you know, all gurus,
everything, everybody's a perv,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody, you know, all this stuff,
you know, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, and, and as a result,
you know, I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this time of revelation, I feel like
cannabis and hemp are almost the leading
[SPEAKER_02]: horsemen of this apocalypse, you know,
and, and, you know, the, the more we can
[SPEAKER_02]: embrace and engage the plant, the more,
the more it can help, it can help give us
[SPEAKER_02]: the tools, you know, to alleviate
suffering and to lead in this time,
[SPEAKER_02]: this new time of revelation and this
shifting of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, leading the,
and then, you know, leading the charge for
[SPEAKER_02]: all the other plant superheroes that are,
you know, the other horsemen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well said Alec for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, I'm in full agreeance.
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the shift that's been happening
slowly, but surely with mainstream and
[SPEAKER_13]: alcohol consumption.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, people are understanding
now that alcohol consumption during these
[SPEAKER_13]: times, as well as really any times,
it's just not noticeable.
[SPEAKER_13]: People become hypnotized by it,
particularly people who are abusing it on
[SPEAKER_13]: a high level.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't realize how foggy they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't realize how many, how they're
just vibing at a lower frequency,
[SPEAKER_13]: how it just brings them down and creates
depression.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not the party that it seems to
be.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see so many people in,
you know, in quarantine, like for five,
[SPEAKER_13]: six months and drinking more and getting
into fights and beaten wives and beaten
[SPEAKER_13]: kids.
[SPEAKER_13]: And slowly, but surely I see this,
this shift where people are like
[SPEAKER_13]: acknowledging this, this drug and what it
does and how it'll take everything from
[SPEAKER_13]: you if you allow it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that it's, you know, potentially based
on the amount of deaths.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on the amount of deaths annually
that it produces, it's probably one of the
[SPEAKER_13]: most dangerous drugs on the planet.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's incredible how mainstream it
is.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now people shifting into maybe I'll try
some cannabis and not only like unraveling
[SPEAKER_13]: the lie that is alcohol, but now
unraveling the lie that is cannabis and
[SPEAKER_13]: realizing in this shift, wow, like I've
had enough of that and I'm looking forward
[SPEAKER_13]: to a little bit more of this.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I hate to be the voice of dissension,
but I just started drinking.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually think it's quite an interesting
drug.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I practice makes perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not good at it or anything,
but yeah, I really haven't ever been a
[SPEAKER_14]: drinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between a drug and a
medicine is dose, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a poison in the medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have intention.
[SPEAKER_15]: Alcohol is not a medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Alcohol is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I mostly get my views on it from growing
up in an incubator of alcoholism in my
[SPEAKER_13]: city and the way people abused it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, you know, my mother working at
911 and me asking her, Hey, what
[SPEAKER_13]: percentage of calls are 911 related?
[SPEAKER_13]: And her saying, Oh, you know, probably
between like 80 and 85.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my sister chiming in and going,
come on, mom, it's got to be 90 because
[SPEAKER_13]: she also works there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm thinking like, wow, like 80 to 90%
of the calls that go into the police are
[SPEAKER_13]: alcohol related.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that is a huge, like serious tear on
the social fabric, like the cost of that
[SPEAKER_13]: alone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I start thinking, it must be the
equivalent at the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there must be such a huge percentage
of people that are ending up at the
[SPEAKER_13]: hospitals through whether, you know,
car accidents, because people are drunk.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or fights or this, that, and the other
thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just sort of started to blow my
mind at the cost of this, this particular
[SPEAKER_13]: drug that just seems to cause so much pain
and anguish.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think from an extractor perspective,
I think of like, yeah, like Mark said,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's a solvent.
[SPEAKER_13]: What it does is it extracts the essence of
things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see people who have abused it
over the course of 30 or 40 years have had
[SPEAKER_13]: their essence extracted.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it just won't take that medicine
from the, from the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems to do it from people too.
[SPEAKER_13]: At least from my limited perspective,
I don't feel that way about people who
[SPEAKER_13]: seem to have a relationship with it where
they can actually just drink a glass of it
[SPEAKER_13]: and have quite an enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more the people that seem to be out
of control from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That just, they, they tend to fall into
the hook where they hang out with people
[SPEAKER_13]: who can enjoy alcohol without having a
problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they're, you know, it doesn't
work out that way for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just my perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it used to be medicine, you know,
so did tobacco.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there was a relationship to it
that I think the problems are endemic.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're social as well, cultural.
[SPEAKER_14]: And deeply emotional.
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are the deeper issues where we
blame the drug and we name, we name and
[SPEAKER_14]: blame the drug.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I'm sort of like, I feel like that's
what if some drugs are bad, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: and it seems like the immunity defense
though, it goes down so far with alcohol
[SPEAKER_18]: use that besides the addictive tendencies
and the social repercussion that just
[SPEAKER_18]: personally, just my opinion, but it seems
like watching now this day, more than
[SPEAKER_18]: ever, people got to keep their immune
defense high and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know if I ever had more than one,
I haven't drank for, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: 15, 16 months straight, just quit over a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know back then even it would,
it would lower my immunity.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't even feel that way.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't feel whole.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't feel, you know, healthier well,
even if I was living well otherwise.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just feel like it, it's the immunity
defense hit that it takes.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's too much risk these days.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you guys are trying to talk me out of
drinking, huh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think now, you know what, actually I'm
going to just, I want to say that I think
[SPEAKER_14]: we, we, um, we blame the drug.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, you know, walking in the smoke
and being living in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not disagreeing with you that our
bodies do react to, uh, negative,
[SPEAKER_14]: um, input the dark.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a dark, it has dark qualities,
but really it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's we that possess the dark qualities.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we, uh, you know, that we,
we engage them and instead, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: our, our, we're not attending the church
of, of consciousness enough, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, awareness of communicating that
between and with one another, listening,
[SPEAKER_14]: listening to one another, because we
always have something to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'm saying something right now
myself, but I'm, but I just mean,
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we, we have, um, we have an
opportunity to take just to, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, dismiss the blame around the items and
put it more directly where, sorry about my
[SPEAKER_14]: phone here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, to place it more and take personal
responsibility to, um, address our
[SPEAKER_14]: frailties as, as human beings and,
and, uh, to, to recognize the frailties in
[SPEAKER_14]: one another without blame or judgment and
would super hard to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying I don't judge.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a big judger.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, you know, I think my, you know,
have, I have a big ego and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to tame it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe by the time I really am a hundred,
it'll be a little more under control,
[SPEAKER_14]: but I'm not, I'm just saying, so I found
it was kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's surprising to me that, wow,
I'm like, this alcohol is, this is
[SPEAKER_14]: interesting, but you know, it's not,
um, I really think one of the most
[SPEAKER_14]: important things that this isolation or
this period of isolation for me is the,
[SPEAKER_14]: the, uh, way that I'm absolutely stuck
with myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's just so obvious to be with
me that, um, it's everything is magnified.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's bigger.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's oh, I'm the only one in the room.
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell, what the hell's going on?
[SPEAKER_15]: You started drinking, you started drinking
during this COVID shutdown thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, wait, I started drinking.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't, as a matter of fact, I'm drunk
now.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's why I don't have my, that's why I
dropped my computer.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm just saying I, I never really have
been a drinker.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, so actually, yeah, I,
I was more speaking less, I was more
[SPEAKER_14]: speaking to alcohol having been a medicine
and that we take things to a place where
[SPEAKER_14]: we devalue them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And while I didn't say that, um,
I think that's true that we put it,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, we put a spin on the things around us
when really it's our spin.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what's happening within us that leads
us to become abusive to others and abuse
[SPEAKER_14]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we're abusing ourselves and our
bodies, our temples, this magical
[SPEAKER_14]: exquisite 50 trillion cell piece of
magnificence and, and miraculous or
[SPEAKER_14]: magical, uh, manifestation, then yeah,
then we take that to others.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't, I'm just saying it's not the
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's tough to divorce alcohol from
all the baggage though that comes along
[SPEAKER_17]: with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I, I'm just glad that now,
you know, with cannabis and like Alex
[SPEAKER_17]: said, maybe some other plant medicines
where we're having other options.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause yeah, from my perspective,
alcohol is one of the heaviest heaviest
[SPEAKER_17]: drugs out there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've tried most of them and,
uh, and for it to be kind of the only
[SPEAKER_17]: option we had for so long, um,
a wise, wise choice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause there's a lot of vagaries that comes
with it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, you know, maybe if you could take that
all away and experience it like you're
[SPEAKER_17]: experiencing it, um, kind of for the first
time then, and you could do it without all
[SPEAKER_17]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I could see where maybe, maybe there would
be some, some benefit to alcohol,
[SPEAKER_17]: but right.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's speed, there's, you know,
there go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, and, and you, yeah,
that you're trivially the queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also like one of the highest level,
like wizard, like Jedis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in my life that has worked with
medicines of all sorts and types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you're all, you are also
coming to it with a very, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a realized, you know, aware perspective
and, and, you know, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, kind of on that botany of
desire level, you know, kind of how much
[SPEAKER_02]: these certain plants that built empires
and kind of industry and how much human
[SPEAKER_02]: suffering and, and, and violence and just
personal destruction and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, yeah, all that, that it led to,
you know, I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, though, it's like, that's,
you know, I feel like the, that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: these other plants are coming in and all
the work that you've done and we are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis and helping to raise this
vibration to 420 because we're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause now that like, you know,
we, cause we are, no, we know this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have this love and reverence for
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the work we're doing with it is now
helping to spiritually forklift so many of
[SPEAKER_02]: our friends and family.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are in these states of peer abuse and
suffering and use of alcohol is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine or in their case, pure poison to,
to, to further destroy their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas kind of, we know these other
plants are available to expand our
[SPEAKER_02]: repertoire, you know, in our medicine
portfolio, cause it's like the poisons and
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines and say, what do you choose to
imbibe in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, kind of cannabis,
you know, where we see this benefit and we
[SPEAKER_02]: are bringing this benefit out to the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I feel like we're,
we need to be the spiritual and
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelic astronauts that we are to
continue that, you know, kind of leveling
[SPEAKER_02]: up to 720 and beyond, you know,
to help bring these other medicines that
[SPEAKER_02]: are so needed in this level, in this
moment of suffering, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like ayahuasca, peyote, all these,
you know, indigenous rites of passage and
[SPEAKER_02]: traditions that are, you know,
purposefully suppose their, their purpose
[SPEAKER_02]: is to help heal and alleviate the trauma
and suffering of the past and your
[SPEAKER_02]: ancestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like alcohol is not going to
do that, but you know, starting to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with other plants, you know, can get you
to a point I feel in life where you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of not over leverage one
plant or poison ally that you have in your
[SPEAKER_02]: life over another, but, but to,
to, to really just to have reverence for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants and for the med, what you put
in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that in fact, your body is the
temple.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's the reverence point.
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually it's quite interesting
because I've noted many times and learned
[SPEAKER_14]: this really from primarily time and that
repeated that people with neuropathic pain
[SPEAKER_14]: is it's extremely difficult to minimize
neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quite difficult and, and it's hard to
get ahead of it without being really
[SPEAKER_14]: drugged and some very interesting pieces
of information whereby delivered to me
[SPEAKER_14]: through patients who are allergic to
opiates, which, you know, can complicate
[SPEAKER_14]: the problem because you can often use
cannabis with other drugs to step away
[SPEAKER_14]: from the pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then once you're out of the suffering,
the sufferings out of the pain,
[SPEAKER_14]: you can deal with the pain, but the
suffering is what overwhelms.
[SPEAKER_14]: And many folks have told me that applying
or adding a small amount of alcohol really
[SPEAKER_14]: helps to minimize that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, when you leave, I think what
we villainize the things around us and not
[SPEAKER_14]: to, I mean, I've known a lot of drugs that
have driven me crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: As a matter of fact, I had to ask somebody
to leave this place because, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I really couldn't, the behavior
surrounding alcohol abuse was,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, too much for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so whatever that's, it's the way that
we, you know, it's just a personal
[SPEAKER_14]: responsibility and, and, you know,
whether or not people can manage to look
[SPEAKER_14]: at ourselves, that's, it's not no small
task, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and, and I like to play, I don't know
if it's the devil's advocate, but I like
[SPEAKER_14]: to stand on the side where, you know,
where nobody's standing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I think I do think alcohol has value
and I've seen it work and have recommended
[SPEAKER_14]: it to people.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, have you tried a drink, you know,
because the pain is so pervasive and
[SPEAKER_14]: minimizes life.
[SPEAKER_14]: It minimizes suffering, takes the joy,
the pleasure out of life.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you, it is so difficult to use pain to
transcend as a transcendent tool.
[SPEAKER_14]: It can be, and I've had the experience
twice in my life, once with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_14]: pain and once with an extreme amount of
pain to be able to only twice.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm old and had a lot of pain,
you know, so like, I, I feel like only two
[SPEAKER_14]: times could I ride the pain to another
expression or experience.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, neither of those was with alcohol,
to be honest, this is more of a new trend.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and I just think that we, we have a
tendency to, I do, I don't know what y'all
[SPEAKER_14]: are doing, but I do, I have a tendency to
look at the object and whether it's the
[SPEAKER_14]: object of desire or repulsion,
it's still the object.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not really the, it's not really
the point, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really the point, is it?
So.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well said, Valerie, absolutely agree with
all that you said there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've just happened to sit on the other
side of the fence where I'm, I'm more
[SPEAKER_13]: like, you know, I see, I see Christianity
going into every culture and just,
[SPEAKER_13]: and ripping out their plant sacraments and
replacing it with their plant,
[SPEAKER_13]: their sacrament, wine, the blood of
Christ, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I see what alcohol seems to have done
to indigenous populations around the
[SPEAKER_13]: world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just have such a hard time accepting
it as, you know, I'm not saying get rid of
[SPEAKER_13]: alcohol forever by any means.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that it's so pervasive and
it's so promoted and people seem to not
[SPEAKER_13]: even know how to gather without having it
around and become so dependent on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it causes so much pain that I don't
know how to remove that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I get that there's root causes of
everyone's pain is rooted in trauma that
[SPEAKER_13]: they've had probably as a child.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, if we all looked inside of
one another, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_13]: I get all that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, I think maybe life
would just be a little bit better if that
[SPEAKER_13]: shit wasn't available on everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every single street corner in every single
city is just so pervasive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The tool of oppression.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Alcohol is part of Canadian culture,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you know, uh, during Prohibition
here in the U S a lot of booze came in
[SPEAKER_15]: from Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there was a supply chain that was
created.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the thing that always bothers me,
especially when they make the comparison
[SPEAKER_15]: to our industry cannabis is how double
standard it is like with advertising and
[SPEAKER_15]: everything and how alcohol consumption is
glorified around sporting things and just
[SPEAKER_15]: the whole alcohol culture, alcohol
mentality of consumption and, um,
[SPEAKER_15]: and the behavior that supposedly,
Hey, if I drink a Coors light,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have all these scantily clad
women around the pool with me and Ooh,
[SPEAKER_15]: that's cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yet, you know, cannabis can't even get,
you know, a commercial during the
[SPEAKER_15]: Superbowl.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's, it's, well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_14]: What, when it does, it will have a
scantily clad women.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what's already happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not far.
[SPEAKER_15]: We, that's, I still, if you looked at
acreage, acreage did have a, a commercial
[SPEAKER_15]: that they paid a big ad agency already to
sort of pitch to, to do Superbowl
[SPEAKER_15]: advertising and they were shot down by the
network.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the point is, is that, yeah,
we, there's such an unfair landscape in
[SPEAKER_15]: between the glorification of alcohol
consumption and what they've done to
[SPEAKER_15]: demonize cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there to me, I'm Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if this is the way you feel
again being Canadian.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I, I just feel that, man,
there's too much alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: You, we don't need more people drinking
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love a craft beer and I certainly love
my single malt scotch, but I, you know
[SPEAKER_15]: what?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll abstain from alcohol use if it means
making cannabis use fully legal and
[SPEAKER_15]: accessible to everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm certainly not a prohibitionist
and I certainly wasn't saying prohibit
[SPEAKER_13]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just saying, don't make it available
on every single street corner,
[SPEAKER_13]: like everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like booze, booze, booze.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't let like, like it seems to have a
very, a fairly low LD 50 number.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yet it just is in everyone's house
without being protected.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like, there's, oh, there's
little babies and little toddlers.
[SPEAKER_13]: And oh, I've got enough alcohol here to
kill like five children.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is, it is one of the matrix
tools, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just like the amount of,
I mean, you know, to me, what's just so
[SPEAKER_02]: often is just this like cycle of almost
just droneness that happens from the food
[SPEAKER_02]: system, poisoning us, the reliance on the
pharmaceuticals that then drone us out
[SPEAKER_02]: further.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turns out that they're owned
by the same people, you know, making the
[SPEAKER_02]: poisons that are life estate, killing our
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, kind of Bayer is
selling the pharmaceuticals to make us
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, and then the
recreational drug of choice is then
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco, you know, as well as alcohol and
tobacco, you know, the way tobacco is used
[SPEAKER_02]: is one of the greatest crimes against
humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they call it the red man's
curse, you know, and it's taken this one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the greatest, most preyed upon
sacraments and herbs to use in a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: way to pray and to amplify your prayer out
into the universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took it and we completely raped it,
sprayed it with all the poisons and
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals, you know, of World War II and
kind of death and pesticides and poison
[SPEAKER_02]: and created an industry around smoking as
you stress on life and taking smoke breaks
[SPEAKER_02]: and amplify.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not, you don't use the tobacco
in the way that is supposed to be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use it in a way to amplify the
destructive power of tobacco in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, you know, between the
way tobacco and alcohol have been
[SPEAKER_02]: fetishized, you know, for, you know,
kind of as the alleviators of stress and
[SPEAKER_02]: the tools for us to, you know,
chill out after a hard day at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think those combined with the
food system that's poisoned is just one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the greatest crimes against humanity and
this matrix droneness that's led to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of so much suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where, yeah, I feel like,
and I agree with you, Marcus, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you know, I mean, there's so
many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's, you know, it's the,
yeah, leveler up in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like bringing up the frequency
and the vibration and the level of
[SPEAKER_02]: suffering and healing and so, you know,
bring it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it brings way for the other
clients, but it's, yeah, it's a trip
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, tobacco, the same way
it's been used in such a profoundly
[SPEAKER_02]: dishonest or just disrespectful way and
way that you know, I mean, tobacco hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: killed kind of the people in the way,
I mean, the way it's used in Hoppe in
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil, the tobacco snuffs that's used,
the way mapacho and North American,
[SPEAKER_02]: South American, you know, indigenous
tradition, it's like very, very different
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it won't be too long before
we see cannabis advertised in the way that
[SPEAKER_14]: both, well, tobacco less, of course now,
but alcohol, the way that it's advertised.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the kind of relationship that's
created by a corporate infrastructure that
[SPEAKER_14]: supports this, a specific type of
advertising.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to reach as many people, to sell as
much product.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so as long as we, I think,
as long as we are not self-reflective and
[SPEAKER_14]: not looking at productizing marketing,
what is it that we're selling?
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, I think that that's obviously
that's what happened with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, I don't know, I don't smoke
cigarettes, but you know, I smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, I mean, I just think that we,
I'm not going to say that I haven't had
[SPEAKER_14]: some bad drugs because I certainly have
and never seemed to try, that doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_14]: so attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I really question the way that we look
at the world around us and the way that we
[SPEAKER_14]: engage with the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, we, but me, you know,
the way I do, the way I look at myself and
[SPEAKER_14]: what I buy and how it is sold to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I see cannabis as very paralleling
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_14]: And very soon, you know, the next big,
what is it that you, what game were we
[SPEAKER_14]: just playing?
[SPEAKER_14]: What game was supposed to have been played
that this, was it the Super Bowl?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you were saying, Mark?
[SPEAKER_15]: Super Bowl, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Super Bowl, sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a sports guy, but you know,
it's just, we have to take responsibility,
[SPEAKER_14]: but we also have to call out
responsibility on the marketing,
[SPEAKER_14]: the way that cannabis is being marketed
and the way it's being absconded and the
[SPEAKER_14]: viewpoint, you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you open a magazine and look at
cannabis, the way it's sold is very much
[SPEAKER_14]: the way that alcohol is sold.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's so, you know, kind of getting
less and less.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're seeing different kinds of
marketing occurring, but you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess the question is really,
what do we want to sell and what do we
[SPEAKER_14]: want to buy?
[SPEAKER_14]: And who do we buy it from?
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's my, I have a much bigger,
you know, I want to make Amazon,
[SPEAKER_14]: I want a prohibition for Amazon.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, to me, one of the dark,
that's the dark side.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not what you drink.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_14]: Who makes it?
[SPEAKER_14]: How do they make it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Who suffers because of it?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the service that's being done?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we serving ourselves, our planet,
the people that we work with?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we serving, what do we serve?
[SPEAKER_14]: And the people that, and who do we serve?
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now we, a lot of us serve Amazon
and we serve a very dark mission.
[SPEAKER_14]: And to save, I don't know, a buck or five
dollars or a thousand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and there are other ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of it is linked.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you guys are right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm not going to, I'm going to
bust out my bottle in a second.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you can't see me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm totally kidding.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just think those, there are so many
really big questions and it's all linked.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all linked to just everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the mycorrhizome.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about it right here,
but what, and what, how does that extend
[SPEAKER_14]: to every single thing that we take in,
that we, everything that we do,
[SPEAKER_14]: our actions, every puff we take,
every breath we breathe, every word we
[SPEAKER_14]: speak, you know, does it improve upon the
silence?
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, my alcohol route.
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really appreciate the conversation
completely today on every level.
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked about some good things.
[SPEAKER_13]: It got me excited to be here for another
episode of Hash Church.

minutes.
