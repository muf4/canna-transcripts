[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Tony and Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are over Negril for the last few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've hooked up with the Nomads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing a little car rearranging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Evy's over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birdeye's in the Mercedes here,
just moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to follow them to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show was good last night, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: They played killer, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They played killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple of moments where there
was some celebrity action going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old schoolers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the Nomads, Bongo Herman came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He invited up Lee Scratch Perry,
which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good photo shoot they did with the
Nomads and Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Andrew Tosh came up after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afterwards, man, he was killing it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really grew up and kind of became very
Peter-esque.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was impressed with the music and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a little adventure
with the Nomads and we'll bring you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, tonight is Prodigy's CD release
album.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure of the name of the album.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, do you know the name of Prodigy's
album that's releasing tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ancient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it is Ancient Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ancient Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ancient Future now, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ancient has to do with the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Future has to do with the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right in between there, that's some
beautiful words they will find put
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's creating the Ancient Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That future that brings you what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What in the know makes you feel so ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Ancient Future.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so heading out of Negril here
following the Nomads.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just in the last strip, which is
mostly just monstrous hotels like Sandals
[SPEAKER_02]: and these types of resorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Sandals right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big monster entrances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly all inclusives down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned we're still driving back.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're here in Runaway Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about 40 minutes past Montego Bay on
our way to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've already been through St.
Anne.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't barely remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we'll be turning in soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done this drive in too many
times myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually fly in either to Kingston when
I'm going to Kingston or fly into Mo Bay
[SPEAKER_02]: if I'm going to Negril or the other side
of the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more of a reality as we come here
more and more for CRD and UCAN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting more things done in the business
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do driving and it's not like
we're really here for tourist trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, that'll be in the future too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting times here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, it was amazing at the
Stepping High Festival to have all those
[SPEAKER_02]: ganja plants fully budding on the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even see that in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still heading to Kingston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still excited about the Protege CD release
party today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Ancient Future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dichotomous name.
[SPEAKER_02]: How protege makes the future ancient.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we're going to learn tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just actually going on a detour to
the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a part of it up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're driving through a small little town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tight road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some big trucks in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not lost the Nomads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Evy and Bird Eye are still in front of us
doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got dabbed up in Negril before we left
but we haven't dabbed since.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be good to get back to Kingston and
get the D-nail going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're low on dabs but what we suspect
we're going to do for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: days rather than not have dabs is get a
nice steam chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably we should have two or three of
those over at our buddy's house anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a nice chalice session.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to admit I got a really nice head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head rocker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bell ringer if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: From hitting those vapor chalices last
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you're not getting the
concentrated hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a much lighter, tasty sort of fluid
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you've got to do is you've got
to... Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting it going and eventually
once it finally gets going you get these
[SPEAKER_02]: hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get this light headed almost like
you're going to fall down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've been hyperventilating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of the vapor chalice
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the country right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just some beautiful shit right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's what I love about that wide
angle lens man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gives you that little extra bit that you
don't have to really pan over to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much wider frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Spanish town toll highway so
we've got to pay for this highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple hundred J's up at the toll as we
get closer into Spanish town.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will whip us in now in probably under
a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until we reach traffic which maybe will be
15, 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the time that we're rolling
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: How beautiful the countryside is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're putting a highway right through
the center of these mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That semi is still like flying behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going like 100, 130 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going 140 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 140 is in your blind spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't even see it through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude that's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: 140 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show the speedometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: 140.
[SPEAKER_02]: That truck is behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man he was speeding up to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his lights on now coming after
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can get him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his sirens on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can get him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having fun here in Jamaica people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some quality footage you get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be editing that transition in for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble man decided to pass our escort.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes bird eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude you just hit that little kid so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude he'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what
[SPEAKER_02]: the best part is?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're driving on these streets right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Screeching our wheels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really driving like maniacs by any
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you never see the like ladies with
little kids give you dirty looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving here is quite something.
Driving here is quite something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was going to open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that footage will just be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This footage I usually just grab very
short pieces of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to show behind the scenes and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following our buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are deeply in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so shiny under the clouds bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever grab your air iron last
night?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straightener?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course right when I go to do that I got
no trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be cool looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at it.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you're laughing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that was so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You almost broke my left arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine the mountain just comes into the
car and breaks your arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone off the road three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving through Jamaica is slightly
traumatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite as traumatic as
snowmobiling in the mountains but it's up
[SPEAKER_02]: there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four hours of intense race car driving.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Near death.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have we been doing this for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Four and a half hours today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We leave at two?
[SPEAKER_02]: We left that early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say close to two man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We left early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was close to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's four fifty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little later than that I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: No it's five fifty sorry yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be in Kingston here real soon
but what will happen is we'll be driving
[SPEAKER_02]: for another half hour and then we'll get
into traffic when we finally get into
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingston and that'll be another half hour
and we'll actually be back at seven o
[SPEAKER_02]: 'clock which is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just in time for the eight o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Door open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Door opening at Pegasus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating the Proche and the Indignation
band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which really won't start until nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping on getting an interview with
Proche.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to see if I can't pull him aside
for a few minutes and do a little
[SPEAKER_02]: interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask him about what's been going on since
the eight year affair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since his release party at the Edna Manley
School of Music here in Kingston that I
[SPEAKER_02]: was present for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now this is ancient future so it'll be
nice to see the growth of the band over
[SPEAKER_02]: the last three years during the reggae
revival.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pulling into Kingston here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can see uptown just above
Kingston coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Mountains in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caribbean Sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the magic hour here as
photographers know the magic hour is right
[SPEAKER_02]: as the sun sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun sets in Jamaica at six oh nine and it
is six oh nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did hit the side of the car on the
mountain just now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a crazy ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey you know what this one paved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did a great job actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah relatively not too many potholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the real kind of stop you dead
when you hit a pothole and pop your tire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the flow is a lot better on this
route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we're not talking about the flow OG
we're just talking about the flow of
[SPEAKER_02]: traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait for this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on stoked for this.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard for the music so quick track two
is criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first reading winter sentiment
that started the whole project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it and knew that all right this
youth has some serious production skills
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can do some work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This song I wrote right off the bat right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about Walter Rodney you
know visions of Peter Tosh murder in
[SPEAKER_00]: September 11 1987 talking about Dirty
Bookman in there and his you know
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution in Haiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the fact that the band
Walter Rodney from Jamaica just channeling
[SPEAKER_00]: all these energies you know going up
against the real criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walter you know you know the world right
now not just the people.
