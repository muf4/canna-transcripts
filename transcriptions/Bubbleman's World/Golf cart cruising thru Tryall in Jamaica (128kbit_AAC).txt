[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at the Try All Golf Resort cruising
around in this cool little golf cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do a live video, but it wasn't
letting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to at least still do an actual
video so that we can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show you this cool little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna have to turn my phone around because
of the way I'm doing the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't allow me to switch my cameras
from angle to angle from front to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just in this really cool little
neighborhood up top called Barnes Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually heading down to the beach
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go through a little
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go underneath the main highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so we have beautiful places up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect this is a neighborhood of very
wealthy people because the homes are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely the nicest I've ever seen in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's the driveway to one
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really sweet looking spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some on the beach, some up on the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish this was a live video and we
could just be showing you everything live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one's just going to be a short
little get uploaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you a little feel of the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to head straight down
past Copperwood Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the magic spot for sure right
here.
Nice big house up on the hill there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like that, we're on the other
side of the highway on the beach side.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are parked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab this and continue on the adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically where the golf club is
and the main restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it's called,
but I was here yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see the walk up is quite
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some footage of this that you'll end
up seeing on the channel later,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like to be able to share little
snippets and clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What better way?
[SPEAKER_00]: See how long this video is in total to get
us into Beautyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just over five minutes and right from the
place into pure paradise on the Caribbean
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was basically what I wanted to
show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of give you a little round about
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came through the restaurant where I
ate yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously if you haven't come to Jamaica
before, you're into cannabis, you're into
[SPEAKER_00]: great food, you're into great music,
the culture here and the people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heading to Negril today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see some of you there for the
tomorrow today festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a bit windy right now,
but yeah, we'll continue this soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody.
Thanks for watching.
