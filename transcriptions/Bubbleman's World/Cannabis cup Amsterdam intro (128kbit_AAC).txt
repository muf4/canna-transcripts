[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here at the Krasnopolsky Apartments
and I am in Amsterdam, just behind Dam
[SPEAKER_00]: Square on the main canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember the name of this
particular canal, but I've been staying on
[SPEAKER_00]: it for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think I'd know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same street that the greenhouse
is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've actually been here for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a bit of problems with slow
uploading, still trying to get my Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: videos up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I would just touch base with
everyone and let you know that all is well
[SPEAKER_00]: and the videos will be coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real nice piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Jarella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony's Turpmeltz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hitting them like mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what those are,
check out the Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpmeltz is Tony's able to extract pure
terpenes from the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: not from any other plant, not using any
chemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: He extracts it and then he reconstitutes
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pure terpenes right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moonshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a ridiculous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one that's Jilly Bean that
he's let cure a little bit and so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a little bit of a different color
and this one also has a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna hit a little rip of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta love staying on the canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're gonna maybe go see Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might end up seeing Rob Clark and
Skunkman Sam and we'll probably end up
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing Ramon and True Cannabis from True
Cannogenetics and OCD Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's just been great so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super excited to show you guys a ton of
this Amsterdam trip and right now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna start by showing you a little
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, more Amsterdam coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble on.
Bubble on.
Bubble on.
Bubble on.
Bubble on.
