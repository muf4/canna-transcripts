[SPEAKER_12]: Hey everybody, welcome to bubble man's
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to episode 161 of hash church.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have taken a couple of weeks off.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of you may have noticed my wake and
bakes have ceased to exist and the hash
[SPEAKER_12]: churches have dried up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not because I didn't want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's because I've been in excruciating
pain for the last couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_12]: three weeks now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hurt myself on my dirt bike to make a
long story short.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really like fall and hurt myself
as much because I just rode it too long
[SPEAKER_12]: and too hard and therefore I damaged my
hip flexor.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually standing right now,
which I'll probably be doing for the rest
[SPEAKER_12]: of this episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try and get through as many
hours as possible, but it looks like maybe
[SPEAKER_12]: a one to two hour church might be a
maximum for me today.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see how well the conversation goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to have a conversation about
hashish today.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have tried to get in touch with some
hashish guys, Michigan mounts,
[SPEAKER_12]: dab logic, solventless mind, of course,
as well as many of our regulars.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as always, it's hard to get in touch
with them at nine in the morning on a
[SPEAKER_12]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_12]: So why don't I invite in our regulars?
[SPEAKER_12]: We can get Mr. Etienne Fontaine into the
room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I've also invited maple butter
in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys have been making some really nice
product here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to invite them in because they
also grow their own products.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's hard to talk about
hashish without really discussing growing
[SPEAKER_12]: for hashish.
[SPEAKER_12]: So without further ado, I will send out
the invitations and see if we can't get
[SPEAKER_12]: some friends into the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope everyone's doing well today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you can't connect, eh?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hotmail is going to give me problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's not going to let me send out
the email.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's try that again, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: It works.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that worked.
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent you the Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I went to send email message to Wade,
to Logitech, and to my friend Neil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually not working.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to just have to take a few
seconds here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got the IACM news.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll be happy to read some news while
you do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty, people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy daylight savings time change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shout out to all the CBD people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're catching a lot of flack right now
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: They finally sent out those letters that
we were expecting finally to scare
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody in the CBD realm.
[SPEAKER_05]: But today's top thing and then the news is
THC may be effective in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_05]: sleep apnea, according to a clinical study
study of the University of Illinois of
[SPEAKER_05]: Chicago, THC was effective in reducing
symptoms of patients suffering from
[SPEAKER_05]: obstructive sleep apnea.
[SPEAKER_05]: 73 adults, 25 received a placebo,
21 received THC daily, and 27 received 27
[SPEAKER_05]: milligrams THC one hour before bedtime for
up to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I'm going in here, authors
concluded that these findings support the
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in
patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one that came out study of the
University of Lyon, France is cannabis use
[SPEAKER_05]: resulted in a small increased risk of
causing fatal accidents.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we know, drug driving is an issue,
especially with inexperienced users,
[SPEAKER_05]: as we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a major situation that still has
to be dealt and confronted with even in
[SPEAKER_05]: our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medicines agency issues warning to
companies selling CBD and claiming
[SPEAKER_05]: anti-cancer effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very interesting way the United
States is going after it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going after it saying it's a
schedule one drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going after claiming any type of
medical effect if you're trying to say
[SPEAKER_05]: that CBD stops cancer from moving,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming hard right now on CBD
products because they've made a huge
[SPEAKER_05]: proliferation across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're starting to see a crackdown
finally of some of these purveyors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as we know, there's a lot of
people out here selling a lot of bullshit
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD products, putting CBD this and making
all kinds of claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's you know, we have to be aware of
claims people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very dangerous when we say that this
thing is going to help heal or do
[SPEAKER_05]: something when we have no science to back
it up because of anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I was talking to Hillary Black
about this very thing just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was like, what do you think about all
these claims?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, claims?
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's like, well, you know,
the CBD claims and then now CBN and CBG
[SPEAKER_12]: claims.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, what do you think of it?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, well, I mean, personally,
I think that it's much like, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: everything there's a there's there's
little grains of truth throughout the
[SPEAKER_12]: center.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then people, you know, just sort of
wrap bullshit around it to make sales.
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD is a tough one, because it's one where
so many people are willing to try and make
[SPEAKER_12]: money with CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: That it's, I don't know, it's I definitely
believe there's medicinal components to be
[SPEAKER_12]: had.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's something going on there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a tough one with all the claims
that people are making right now,
[SPEAKER_12]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have to have science to back up
those claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the things why we got
into testing and doing all these things in
[SPEAKER_05]: the first place is we wanted to debunk
these misinformation and start isolating
[SPEAKER_05]: reality to start pointing things in a
proper direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we've had a proliferation of
all these Johnny Come Lately's who see
[SPEAKER_05]: money and have dollar signs in their eyes
are selling everything from CBD infused
[SPEAKER_05]: water, which, you know, we know CBD
doesn't infuse in water and various other
[SPEAKER_05]: realities that people are trying to,
you know, punch their ticket into the
[SPEAKER_05]: regular market.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of all this,
Sam?
[SPEAKER_05]: You've you've got to kind of be amused by
all this since you've discovered and
[SPEAKER_05]: discarded CBD years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now to watch this proliferation of
this commercial idiocy has to trouble you
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhat.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, if they're making claims
from CBD or any other cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_15]: then they need to really put up or shut
up.
[SPEAKER_15]: I personally believe that it has a lot of
uses, but I don't make claims.
[SPEAKER_15]: And besides that, you know how I
personally feel about CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: You love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, this is something we're
fighting all around the world because
[SPEAKER_05]: supposedly, you know, CBD was made,
you know, people are mailing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people are, you know,
you saw Target actually sell CBD products
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually have them pulled within a few
hours of actually going online.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's major issues that I mean,
investors are looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: That they've looked past the, you know,
the schedule one reality for a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people and have thrown caution to the wind
and have backed CBD unlike anything that
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen, you know, in our world in a
bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely I mean, I see it as clear
as day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's it's like it's what most people
are willing to do before the laws open up
[SPEAKER_12]: and allow for actual, you know,
for this plant to actually be studied.
[SPEAKER_12]: And and and, you know, created into
different products without all these
[SPEAKER_12]: absolute ridiculous restrictions and
limitations.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I wanted to welcome John and Neil into
the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: These guys are from Maple Butter and
they're good fucking dudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm I'm enjoying some maple butter as we
speak here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I'm kind of trying to figure out
which one I should go in on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've really been loving the Rockstar Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is a little bit more sappy than
the the regular ones, but very cushy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes it Rockstar compared to your
regular standard Kush?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's just the the genetic just a
Rockstar Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there what is there specific to it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just a nomenclature?
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably have to ask Ramo.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know he's been growing it for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not quite sure myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just that's one that we picked up along
the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not one of our stable genetics that we
have here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a few Rockstars over the years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember Bong Guru came out with a
Rockstar back in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I think it was Soma's Rockbutt
and Sensei Star across to I think that was
[SPEAKER_10]: a Rockstar.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many things to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why I asked, because the
mutation of these genetics and names
[SPEAKER_05]: nomenclature, you know, people want to
know and need to know so that we can
[SPEAKER_05]: clarify some of this, because there's some
kinds of names that we've thrown on things
[SPEAKER_05]: that are same genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we've got different generations
growing up thinking this is this when it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really this, because, you know,
somewhere along the name, somebody changed
[SPEAKER_05]: the name.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just trying to dispel the baloney.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me tell you that was really good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is Johnny B not in here?
[SPEAKER_13]: Where did Johnny B go?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, guys, I'm not my I'm not my usual
self today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a little off.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear about your back,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know back injuries are painful to take
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've accidentally pinched a sciatic nerve.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've done that, you know how
quickly you can be immobile.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I actually have pretty good mobility.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I've done is I'm pretty sure I've
damaged my hip flexor and we have quite a
[SPEAKER_12]: few hip flexors.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the one that I've damaged in kind of,
you know, where your leg plugs right into
[SPEAKER_12]: your hip, there's these muscles and
ligaments that go all around there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very similar to a rotator cuff,
which if you've ever damaged this rotator
[SPEAKER_12]: cuff like it can take months to heal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in fact, some a lot of times people
end up going in for surgery to heal little
[SPEAKER_12]: tears in that muscle.
[SPEAKER_12]: It feels very much like that in my hip.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really hurt in my back as much
as right under my left ass cheek.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just emanating a throbbing pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really sucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome, Mr. Dr. Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Marcus, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, let me tell you, I've been in some
weird, crazy, excruciating pain for the
[SPEAKER_12]: last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Been trying to deal with it the best that
I can.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'll tell you, I did 300 milligrams
one day just to like, just to relax.
[SPEAKER_12]: The body and it didn't even really.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you lay it down?
[SPEAKER_12]: No.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Flav421 who really put it together
for me because he was like, he was like,
[SPEAKER_12]: what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, oh, I really messed up my
back and I don't know exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, well, what were you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, well, I dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I dirt bike a lot, like four hours a
day for three days.
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the third day, I did six hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't sit down on my bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: I ride on my pegs standing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you got into the position of a
goaltender where you bend your legs and
[SPEAKER_12]: you're okay, that's the position I was in
for 14 hours in three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: You strained all your muscles.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Flav421 who used to be a goaltender
was like, oh, dude, you probably fucked up
[SPEAKER_12]: your hip flexor.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then of course he's like, oh man,
that's like, that could take a year to
[SPEAKER_12]: heal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that's a bad one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, oh, thanks for the,
you know, thanks for the good words,
[SPEAKER_12]: bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you'd rather know the truth than,
you know, sometimes you don't want to know
[SPEAKER_05]: the truth, but in this case you do
because, you know, these types of,
[SPEAKER_05]: those types of injuries are, you know,
you got tendons and everything involved
[SPEAKER_05]: and they have to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, as always during an
episode of Hash Church where I have a
[SPEAKER_12]: specific conversation to take place,
90% of the people that I've invited have
[SPEAKER_12]: not responded.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Sunday.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I suspect they'll be sleeping till 11
or 12 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not too sure if they're going to come
in a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully they do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I had, I liked the idea of having a
nice conversation about making hash today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, it's no problem, Marcus,
because I know everything about hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you share some with us?
[SPEAKER_05]: Share your latest patents as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're aware of what's your,
the list that we're up against.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: Until five minutes ago, I was asleep and
my wife mocked me up and said,
[SPEAKER_15]: don't you want to go to church?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank her for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good on you, Diana.
[SPEAKER_12]: What, you know, keeping, keeping the skunk
man in check.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's church dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wake up.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, do y'all do daylight savings time in
the Netherlands?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: We did it two weeks ago and or three weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: I forget what it was, but we're all in
sync again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to be in sync.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we've got a bunch of people in the
chat room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Should say hello to Jay Henricks and PK
Brewer getting peeled.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cartwheel 406 and Ron Jones, the Spokane
Cannabis Review, Sungrown Tri-Comb Samurai
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam is in the house and Melty Heads and
the Grove Green Show and everyone else.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seventies Mama.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys for all showing up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's at least been 14 days since I have
not put up like a live video, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: even just chat for everyone to kind of
come in and talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm sure I've been getting lots of
emails and lots of messages.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, well, what's going on is
excruciating chronic pain that will not
[SPEAKER_12]: subside.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got my brain on fire and it's,
it's quite something to try and to just
[SPEAKER_12]: try and notice the notice pain and be with
pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, it's definitely something else
for all of those out there who are
[SPEAKER_12]: suffering with chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely feel for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's easier to feel for you when you're in
it yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing like forced empathy through
experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fucking the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, carrying on with the news here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's a new research center to study
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be set up in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Australia is really kicking it
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the Australian center for
cannabinoid clinical research excellence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Acre led by professor Jenny Martin at the
university of Newcastle and professor
[SPEAKER_05]: Nadia Sawalish, um, at the university of
Wollongong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more of that going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, what's going on Abe?
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me bud?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Abe, Abe, Abe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm sure he's going to figure out
his his, uh, his audio and his mic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Abe is a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: I posted on Facebook yesterday,
just saying, Hey, are any hash makers want
[SPEAKER_12]: to come in and talk a little bit?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he posted a, a lovely photo of some of
his works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can actually bring the
redheaded look right there makes hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm, I'm shocked and or odd.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me, uh, let me show you what,
let me show you what he did here real
[SPEAKER_12]: quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he's hearing us cause he's smiling.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what, this is what he did.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I liked the presentation.
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked the photo and I liked the fact
that it actually looks like good quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of important to me,
but not only good quality, you've got a
[SPEAKER_05]: good composition there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice composition.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just like the way it's all been laid
out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love seeing collections over the years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I've gone to some different hash
makers, places around the globe and stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: What really amazed me about that work,
uh, Marcus was that's his, what he made
[SPEAKER_15]: for one day's smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just this daily puffing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Abe's hardcore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_13]: Abe Hoffman?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, welcome dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of kind of breaking up a little bit
though.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe your internet isn't too good
or maybe my internet's not too good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's to know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you can try reducing your picture.
[SPEAKER_15]: That sometimes helps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes you can go up into, uh,
the little, uh, wifi even, and you can
[SPEAKER_12]: adjust the, uh, the, the quality of your
screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess if you lower it enough,
uh, it can speed, it can speed things up
[SPEAKER_12]: for you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another hash maker in the room before 20 K
and Johnny B what's going on gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I'm loving hash this
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who's in the room right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maple butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just talking about where's my bike
and how amazing that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Oh, that's a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys in Ottawa was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you name it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get my kind of where's my
bike tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure your strain or your
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_14]: Where'd you come up with the name?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's a genetics guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Carmen's genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: He lives in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess one of his buddies or someone
puffed it and kind of lost his bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone rides bikes in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of bikes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could lose your car if you haven't
been there much, but losing your bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_15]: How often you're here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can honestly tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: I lost my car.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but you're kind of a unique
individual.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're like one of those guys
that are like, I'll move to Holland.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll live here for 30 years and I will not
learn the language.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you heard the man bong rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: The yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark Rose was the same way and lived in
Kathmandu for decades.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, why don't you learn,
you know, some of the languages like,
[SPEAKER_12]: no, no, no, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I'll hit this bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: The where's my bike is a play on its
lineage.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is higher plane.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the amnesia Hayes crossed with the
biker Kush, which I guess amnesia Hayes is
[SPEAKER_12]: Hayes crossed with Hayes crossed with
skunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one crossed with Hayes crossed with
Hayes crossed with Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_12]: Number five.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the biker Kush is the Lucifer OG
crossed with Hells Angels OG.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put them all together and where's my bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't find your bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we, I remember when I went to
Amsterdam, it was with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we went and met karma up in the top
of his hotel room there and tried the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the, the OG has all his genetics that
were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was, that was his apartment,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went to his apartment and that was really,
and karma is just such an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of those guys that just,
I love Kush is so karma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, I was like, I love with
his weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like piloted and he's like,
here, take this Johnny B and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I, this is what I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's what, you know, helps me get
day through my daily pain and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush's are definitely my medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I was in Amsterdam, that was my
go-to there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went to Dan bring, of course
see Jason and then over to, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, gray zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two places and karma of
course hooked it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely, um, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean the gray area in the gray area.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit gray.
[SPEAKER_13]: What did he call it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, see, I say things backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are really getting used to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark knows it like a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He corrects me at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get my insurance at the auto place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They looked at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, I got you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Another popular copy shop is cats.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I go as they've got the haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they sell it by the bud there at cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't sell it by the grant,
which is another reason why I like going
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember in 1998, Adam made some sage
two, Oh, water hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was for sale at the cat zoo.
[SPEAKER_12]: And man, I'll tell you, it was just like,
Hey, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to, uh, head back down to the
cats.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, let's go down to the cats.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, we were just there yesterday
night, like late.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, well, let's go get some more.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just couldn't fucking get enough of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like sage two.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, even the play on the name with the
water.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just, was that the stuff that
he pressed into little cards?
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Was really spectacular.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you mixed it 50 50 with a skunk
number one resin, it really made something
[SPEAKER_15]: special.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really, really, really liked it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it was definitely turpinoline rich.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was definitely like some high anxiety
resin, which of course you would really,
[SPEAKER_12]: really like.
[SPEAKER_12]: I also really, really like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny because a lot of people really,
really, really don't like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You give them a blast of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're just like, Oh man,
I feel like you like jumpstarted my
[SPEAKER_12]: central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, yeah, dude, that's what we just
did, but to each their own, to each their
[SPEAKER_12]: own different smokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like a shirt from 1968 or
something.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or different saturation points for every
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, that's a little more 2014.
[SPEAKER_15]: My wife says the same thing that I'm still
wearing the shirt from 1968.
[SPEAKER_15]: Would I please take a shower?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love when your wife posts pictures of
your guys's travels.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, when you guys were real
young, it's very neat to see that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a, I could be honestly like a book
in itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly can't remember when I was real
young.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just too long ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what the beauty of pictures
are.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you can look at the pictures and
be like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got, did I tell you guys the funny
story?
[SPEAKER_12]: The, that was me story of the guy who hit
the DNT and Nelson bunch of people
[SPEAKER_12]: standing around and he hit the ground in
front of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was doing this crazy Homer Simpson,
like full blown freak out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were all like, Whoa, he is tripping
balls.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then out of the blue, he like does one
of these moves where he just pops up off
[SPEAKER_12]: of his shoulder onto his feet,
kind of backwards, back into the crowd of
[SPEAKER_12]: people, like with us looking down and he
goes, that was me tripping like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like he came to this realization that it
was, it was fucking one of the funniest
[SPEAKER_12]: things ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: DMT will do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which reminds me for those of you that
have not checked it out, I wanted to start
[SPEAKER_12]: the episode with this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, you should absolutely go,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: Turn hash church off right now and go
listen to the Joe Rogan podcast with Paul
[SPEAKER_12]: Stamets.
[SPEAKER_12]: It will blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, I was bummed.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was only two hours, but one of the
greatest podcasts listening to Paul
[SPEAKER_12]: Stamets, uh, you know, talk about
different mushroom trips and, uh,
[SPEAKER_12]: just all the different information that
he's been pumping out about the fun guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, inspirational for real and don't
really turn off hash church.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can just go watch it after it was
good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a lot of the people in the
audience, uh, in the YouTube chat room,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, absolutely watched it and loved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There I was.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you, so where, where are you located,
man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke some of that hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm guests in America.
[SPEAKER_12]: Although every question I ask,
uh, I don't, I don't think that he hears
[SPEAKER_12]: me because, uh, hugging the tree,
lightning storm.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Andy Bravo, 20 grams of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Spokane, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you're just around the corner.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: Spokane, Washington may have been the,
I, I do hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're pretty close to, um,
Abbotsford.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just over the border hop,
skipping the jump across the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that far from Paul Stamets either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: True enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've, uh, I'm not sure if he's still in
Olympia.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not, I'm not sure if he's,
I think he might've moved.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, if he's moved from Olympia,
then, uh, yeah, I haven't been up there in
[SPEAKER_15]: a long time to his place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I could be wrong, but he definitely still
lives in Washington.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's talk hash guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a hashish episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's talk hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of wished us, I could have gotten
in touch with solventless mind because
[SPEAKER_12]: he's just been crushing the hash game
lately, but such as life when you're in
[SPEAKER_12]: chronic pain and you have no chance or
ability to get up off the couch and
[SPEAKER_12]: actually send a message to someone to do
the pre.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love to do the pre-check on to see if
everyone's equipment's going to work,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I just don't pull it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just not professional enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that hash is working pretty good for
your pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yes and no, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely like, there are moments,
whereas I, I suspect a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_12]: this that have great levels of pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are moments in the day where the
pain is just much, much greater,
[SPEAKER_12]: where you just get a two or a three or a
four hour period where nothing seems to
[SPEAKER_12]: release it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when you get into the good old
heavy doses of tinctures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice roll ons with Terps that I got from
Dr. Natasha, which were really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all these different ways,
but everything here, this is, this is a,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is actually an extraction made with a
Harlequin and Haley's Comet sugar leaf,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is all CBD put into a tincture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I'm in a lot of pain lately,
I've been kind of using this and I have a
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD roll on for my knees, which is also
made with go figure hash, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have most of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stuff as well, different, you know,
creams and salves and tinctures and
[SPEAKER_12]: capsules and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But my pain threshold is, is so high that
it's doing very, very little to actually
[SPEAKER_12]: relieve the pain.
[SPEAKER_12]: The pain's just, it's just insane,
dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even right now it's fucking throbbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's when we get on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for me, I took a bunch of sift that
came out of a trim bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did some trimming through the trim bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was roughly about a hundred micron
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that sits on top of those and
brought that home and cleaned her up there
[SPEAKER_04]: on Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just threw on the screen, did the static
clean and man, that's what I'm hitting
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe me, it's, it's doing really
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's different ways of being
able to get what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, I'm a daily hash maker,
just like yourself and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_04]: people here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm not squishing, I'm sifting,
if I'm not sifting and squishing,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm washing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now I'm not washing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause of the neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, lots of sifting and squishing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would not be surprised later when I go
to the hospital and get x-rayed.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they tell me my hip is broken,
that's the kind of pain that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just been consistent for like a
couple of weeks now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then it's time to go get some
x-rays.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gonna have to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since you broke it two weeks ago,
it really makes no difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'll just have to like, they'll tell
you to lie down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is what I've been doing anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've broken 16 by bones in my life,
including my collarbone and my wrists,
[SPEAKER_12]: most of my fingers, my thumbs,
both my wrists, my ankles.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're just evening out the per capita
average.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I haven't broken anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm a bit of an extreme person in
the sense that I've always pushed my body
[SPEAKER_12]: a little further than it could really go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna say Sam's broken a lot of heads
off of stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's broken a lot of, a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Schneer here.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_13]: Zach.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good to see you dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got Zach in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the last time I made it,
he's, he's, he's picking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my bike right now?
[SPEAKER_12]: The last time I was with Zach,
we made hash for, was that like one
[SPEAKER_12]: straight day?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought so.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So out in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, area on the couch eating pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was that night that I showed up and
left when you were sleeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You finished our extra large pizza.
[SPEAKER_13]: We went down in the morning to eat a piece
and we were like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: He ate the whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say that's such a Johnny B
maneuver.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we eat, we eat two, we eat two pieces
each.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like six pieces or five pieces,
four pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: John's like, all ready then there was
four, you know, I was like, I ate two,
[SPEAKER_04]: took two with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long flight home.
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome solverless minded.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Hashi, you made it.
[SPEAKER_14]: How do I use this?
[SPEAKER_13]: You just like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just talk and it's now you're,
you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Although there, there will be a point
where someone might unmute their mic that
[SPEAKER_12]: might create a feedback.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in that sense, if you click your mouse
on the screen somewhere and look for the
[SPEAKER_12]: little icon, that's a microphone,
you can click on that and it will mute you
[SPEAKER_12]: and unmute you when you want to talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely the best if you can figure
that part out, but otherwise you sound
[SPEAKER_12]: good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is good with it?
[SPEAKER_14]: You're killing the fucking ass game,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was watching your shift in that
microplaning.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microplaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where am I watching the microplaning?
[SPEAKER_12]: Microplaning or seething.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seething, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, we've got to be
specific because we don't want to call,
[SPEAKER_12]: we don't want to call solvers as in
microplaner.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I heard that guy microplanes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, geez, that's kind of mean.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't heard that before.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you've microplanned before,
haven't you, Johnny B.?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've done a lot of things with,
yeah, kind of percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done some planning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done some, I've, I've really,
if there's anything new I can learn,
[SPEAKER_04]: that'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always willing to find and learn new
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all about the hash, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it is all about the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as far as I'm concerned, it seems to
all be about, at least for mechanical
[SPEAKER_12]: screen separation and water hash,
it seems to be about capitate stocks and
[SPEAKER_12]: the Cecil stocked trichome, because I
don't seem to pull out as many of the
[SPEAKER_12]: bulbous as I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of those particular two, to me,
it's always made the argument as to why
[SPEAKER_12]: oil comes out with a higher yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I know Indra and other people
claim that the oils are present inside the
[SPEAKER_12]: plant, not just in the head, but for me,
I've only really ever seen it in the head.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've only experienced it in the head.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so those two types of heads are the
heads that I'm looking to extract.
[SPEAKER_12]: But before I get to looking to extract
heads, I need to find people that can
[SPEAKER_12]: allow those heads to express themselves to
the maximum potential of their genetic
[SPEAKER_12]: ability, as well as the variables that are
going on in the room, the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_12]: the field, wherever it happens to be
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly development that I've seen when
I've brought new hash from other friends
[SPEAKER_04]: of mine and you've cleaned it and you're
like, it just, there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, it's the classic question.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the classic question.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, how do I get my hash to melt like
yours?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta grow it first.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not gonna, well, I told solventless
mind this just the other day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just said, well, you have to grow better
buds or whoever you're getting your
[SPEAKER_12]: material from has to grow better buds.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always nice when you're in the
situation that maple butter's in,
[SPEAKER_12]: where you are controlling that aspect
because you're growing that bud.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not easy to find that quality of
material just out in the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be honest, yeah, it's taken years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be honest, I said this as well,
the solventless mind the other day,
[SPEAKER_12]: the guys that you know of as the best hash
makers, you know, the most key important
[SPEAKER_12]: factor in all of that is that they either
grow or get given the best quality
[SPEAKER_12]: material.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's step one.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just step one.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not getting that material,
it's very hard to polish a turd.
[SPEAKER_15]: You sometimes even see varieties that will
produce really great hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: But just not very much of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you really want is both.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want great hash and lots of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you get to great quality resin that
you can unveil to beautiful quality hash,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's the next most sensible thing is that
you want to get a great yield off of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why you've heard me raving
about this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's my bike?
[SPEAKER_12]: Great taste too.
[SPEAKER_12]: 28 to 30% squished out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of a rosin press every time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just put a little button and then it
just squishes the most like 30%.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there's people, oh,
why we get 32, we get 35.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_12]: But is it of a profile that's this
exciting?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you consider that hashish or do you
consider it oil?
[SPEAKER_12]: I consider it oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for whatever reason, people get pissed
at me for that, which is like,
[SPEAKER_12]: I just consider it that from basically the
book that you and Rob wrote, the
[SPEAKER_12]: information from the old schools that's
been passed down.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always thought that intact glandular
trichome heads even pressed it's hash,
[SPEAKER_12]: but completely melted and extracted into a
liquid.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of the fact like when we came up
with full melt and full melt clear dome,
[SPEAKER_12]: and then Jeff Church took it a step
further and came up with the melt star
[SPEAKER_12]: melt categories, which the one,
two, three, four, five, and six star
[SPEAKER_12]: that's for the melt factor.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I started seeing going to the cups
and seeing booths that were oil people,
[SPEAKER_12]: like full blown oil companies,
and I'm not saying that as a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just what they specialize in called
seven star.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, listen, you understand that
the star rating is for the fact that the
[SPEAKER_12]: hash melts.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have Marcus, a separate little
thing here for one second.
[SPEAKER_15]: What made the most bubbles that you've
seen?
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it dry sift, water hash, rosin,
or what?
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, the meltiest product has been at
first by far was your sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time I saw that, I was just
like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people like even me who was
helping popularize these terms and telling
[SPEAKER_12]: people, no, you think it's full melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really like half sizzle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's it's full melt at best,
you know, because people have definitions
[SPEAKER_12]: and they want to be like, oh, my shit's
full melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't hurt anyone if you want to say
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you're a dispensary and you're
calling it full melt and someone comes and
[SPEAKER_12]: pays 80 bucks a gram for it and it's like
half sizzle and it's like just like
[SPEAKER_12]: moisture on the top of it sizzling.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that's not full melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time I saw your shit,
it turned to water and drip through the
[SPEAKER_12]: screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: It took me a few more years to get to a
point where I could grow resin that well
[SPEAKER_12]: to produce into hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would say that the best water hash I
ever made was was was pretty much on par
[SPEAKER_12]: with the best sift that I ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were they were both like 10 pluses.
[SPEAKER_12]: You wouldn't kick either of them out of
bed for eating crackers, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_12]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess what I was really wondering,
because I'm pretty familiar with the the
[SPEAKER_15]: first two was if the raw resin was ever
more bubbly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I've seen rosin froth, but it's
different.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's oil already.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's it's it's not quite the same as
like whatever that violence is that's
[SPEAKER_12]: happening inside the hash where these
terpenes or whatever are just exploding
[SPEAKER_12]: and trying to escape that process.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, whatever, Mark, you know what you
will will get right back to you in one
[SPEAKER_12]: second.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to finish the thought while
it's boiling and melting like that,
[SPEAKER_12]: for whatever reason, to me it's like a six
course dinner versus rosin, which is more
[SPEAKER_12]: like a dessert to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I smoke rosin and I love it,
but it doesn't feel as fulfilling as
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever is going on in the hash that's
boiling and melting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that you curb oscillation,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the conversion of of T.
[SPEAKER_01]: A to 10 that you're breaking up really bad
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me now?
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we can hear you really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you were breaking up bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, maybe you should kill your picture and
just talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I my power cord got fried last night,
so I have my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not usually on a laptop, so I
apologize if I'm not coming through clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost both my headphone and my my
computer in one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gotta go to the Best Buy,
but I'm here in sunny Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, so maybe we'll hook up from
Chris Barone's lab later if there's still
[SPEAKER_01]: a hash church going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mark, what I was saying was that
bubbling that you're seeing is the
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylation of T8 to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry if T8 CA to make THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when that heats up, it carboxylates
and the more heat that you're putting in,
[SPEAKER_01]: the faster that's going to be in the more
the frothiness made in of the types of
[SPEAKER_01]: facts that may be in there, because
certainly things are going to be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more viscous if there's more fats and
larger molecules there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, the higher the terpene content,
the more rapid the bubbling.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, it's got to be something like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, all hash would bubble like that
while you were lighting it, and it's just
[SPEAKER_12]: not the case.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all decarboxylating, but it's not all
melting and bubbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a subtle difference between the
way that the hash is prepared and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually behaves, something bubbling sort
of process, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: None of the hash that I ever made dry
sifting, even a year or two old,
[SPEAKER_15]: was ever decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was always in the acid form.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, those guys look like they're having
too much fun over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like mad action.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at them all.
[SPEAKER_11]: They all look at the camera at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just we're just showing off here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a got some nice big, huge jar of
sift here we did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's nice to have a big, huge jar of
sift, although when you get to be
[SPEAKER_12]: obsessive, compulsive sift cleaner guy,
every time you see sift, you're like,
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder what the percentage of
contaminant is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, we're John's going to go
through this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be down to like a third,
a quarter of this jar eventually.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's still great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's I guess what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: A five minute tumble we did from the last
whole crop mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's a that's a world away from
the great gardener's 24 hour tumble is
[SPEAKER_12]: that he does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we did this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We froze everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tumble outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was minus 12 this week here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we we use the outdoors to to our
advantage.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you if you measure the THC of that,
what is it at?
[SPEAKER_15]: When I used to do just sifting of
unmanicured buds, we used to get about 30,
[SPEAKER_15]: 33 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have an idea, but I know like it
squishes that squishes at about 50 to 60
[SPEAKER_06]: percent on the raws and just as is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's got to be it's got to be up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's TA, not THC, correct?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's TA, correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I completely cleaned up resin so
that it was ninety nine point nine percent
[SPEAKER_15]: and I measured that it was in the very,
very low 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what like I think Tony was
analyzing his some of his rosin when he
[SPEAKER_06]: was doing the pens and it was roughly
about that 80 percent THC on rosin and
[SPEAKER_06]: then what like 12 percent terpenes on his
sauce or now he's bringing it down to like
[SPEAKER_06]: eight percent or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I figured it was about let's say
this must be around 40 percent,
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say maybe 40 percent THC as is
before cleaning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, getting 50 percent return on sift
like having 50 percent heads is definitely
[SPEAKER_12]: a pretty, pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen much, much, much lower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most farmers grade is much lower,
you know, because most people they're just
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a counterintuitive thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again, it's like let's turn this on
and tumble it for a full day so we make
[SPEAKER_12]: sure we get everything it's like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll usually do three times the first time
I tumbled.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, I remember the first time I
tumbled.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: You even sniffed, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, welcome, Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Josh and Kelly in the house.
[SPEAKER_13]: The tree of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to be seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in Spokane right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So so is Abe.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should meet up and burn one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys absolutely should meet up and
burn one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just met Abe myself, but he seems like a
pretty solid dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Kelly and Josh are like the nicest
people you'll ever meet.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all should burn two for all of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I got you covered.
[SPEAKER_15]: Got you covered.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Marcus, we had the best time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or do what I would do, which is smoke a
pipe or a bowl of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_16]: We will host a hash joint for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the best night is right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was so wonderful, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Josh and Kelly gifted my wife and I some
tickets to go see Roger Waters recently,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we got to sit with them and we got to
smoke pure hash joints in the crowd while
[SPEAKER_12]: like while Resist was being put up on the
giant screens.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the security guards were coming and
telling us, hey, you can't smoke that,
[SPEAKER_12]: bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is one of the coolest shows I've ever
been to, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just people passing around joints and
pipes.
[SPEAKER_12]: The joint that they lit was from my friend
in the Kootenays, a pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm telling you, this thing was like a
house fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like we set our chair on fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was it was not your normal amount of
smoke.
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what kind of hash was it,
Marcus, because it's not easy to roll
[SPEAKER_15]: really, really, really high quality resin
into a joint.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just melts and bubbles.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what my friend does is he uses some
lower quality or contaminated dry sift
[SPEAKER_12]: with, you know, natural plant matter,
like trichome components that aren't
[SPEAKER_12]: glandular.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he gets it down to a it's like a gram
per joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I smoked one to my own head.
[SPEAKER_12]: You definitely get pretty high.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you smoke a whole one to yourself,
my most watched YouTube video is smoking
[SPEAKER_12]: one of these pure hash joints.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like one point three million video
views.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're awesome little joints for me
when they said they had one because they
[SPEAKER_12]: make these beautiful, beautiful little
hat.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they got these little guys here
that they gifted.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't smoke these kind of joints.
[SPEAKER_12]: So these these are going to some friends
of mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when they when they were like,
well, we have a joint you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they pulled out a pure hash joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, now that I can get behind.
[SPEAKER_12]: So good.
[SPEAKER_12]: So good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when I saw that video, I went home
and tried to make one immediately.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of people did that very thing,
you know, and it took him a long time to
[SPEAKER_12]: come up with the recipe to figure out the
know how because his are perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: No.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what he used to say to me is,
oh, one is nothing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Start doing 100 an hour.
[SPEAKER_15]: If your hash can burn with a cherry
instead of really, really, really clean
[SPEAKER_15]: resin, which will melt and drip and
bubble, then you can smoke a joint out of
[SPEAKER_15]: it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pure hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the situation of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just that situation exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the maple and the Where's My Bike was
truly phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_09]: While we were there, we got to smoke it
and it was amazing watching it squish out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So good job, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was I got a little of that Frenchy
cannoli bubble hash that he came and made
[SPEAKER_12]: with my friend from High Integrity Glass
Art recently.
[SPEAKER_12]: They left it here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Might have to hit a little dab of that
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that stuff?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's melt, you know, it's,
you know, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_12]: all the different methodologies of how you
get it off and how cold you make it and
[SPEAKER_12]: how you mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's really a simple process that
if you break it down, it's like it can get
[SPEAKER_12]: most of what's there of those two types of
gland heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: It can do it fairly efficiently,
depending on if you don't overstuff it,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you get it cold enough, if you don't
over mix all of these little variables
[SPEAKER_12]: that people like yourself seem to figure
out pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the information's out there and
nothing teaches you better than just,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, making your own mistakes,
which is why when I actually went to make
[SPEAKER_12]: bubble hash with Zach, you know,
I allowed us to make a few mistakes to
[SPEAKER_12]: show him like, oh yeah, like, did you
notice the difference?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like to experience a little mistake is
sometimes better and more valuable in your
[SPEAKER_12]: hash making skills than to try and avoid
all of them and just ask everyone a
[SPEAKER_12]: million questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, man, the reason that guy knows
all that shit is because he went out and
[SPEAKER_12]: made his own mistakes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do the same thing and leave him
the fuck alone.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if you think of children,
how did they learn what is hot and what is
[SPEAKER_15]: not hot?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_15]: They touch it and then they don't do it
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: The master has failed more than the
student has tried.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the people like, how do you take,
how do you take such great pictures?
[SPEAKER_12]: I took 25,000 bad ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's, that's how you,
that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe more.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my next question is that what micron is
that Frenchy cannoli that you're dabbing
[SPEAKER_08]: on right now?
[SPEAKER_12]: If I would have put my money on it because
my friend brought it to me and had it in
[SPEAKER_12]: his pocket, I would say it's 90 micron,
but I'd have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_12]: It definitely is between 73 and 120.
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like a 90, but special K I
haven't hit this cultivar in a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just figured that if Frenchy cannoli was
making it, he was going to pull full spec
[SPEAKER_08]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nature.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, but my buddy's all about his bags as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: So special K that a good variety for
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you talking about homie that just
scooped a machine from him and high
[SPEAKER_08]: integrity glass art?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I just chatted with him not that
long ago and he was telling me that
[SPEAKER_08]: Frenchy was going to bring a machine up to
him.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them stainless ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: He did absolutely got one.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was, he told me he was talking to you
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, dude, right on.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, yeah, I'm going to try and get
him up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, dude, you ever need help?
[SPEAKER_12]: Making bubble.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a few things about it myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: I live right across the water,
but by all means fly people up from other
[SPEAKER_12]: parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I get where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I am busy though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing rosin from, uh, called gas leak
from a South work seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the flavor profile on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Very gassy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the gas leaks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like a chem by chem by it's like
bat crossed four times or something like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gassy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love gassy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the whole gamut.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the fruitiness.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the exotic haziness.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's all good from where I sit and
I'll tell you, I look forward to a day
[SPEAKER_12]: where we can pull up terpenes that are
less known and pull those up into the,
[SPEAKER_12]: into the more known, you know,
producing.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_12]: A little ball of hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a two and a half years old now
from our farm, from our land.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been keeping it, um,
sealed and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super squishy and really nice outdoor
resins from the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been underground on the other
side of the border too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the best, you know, when I,
when I did go to the U S I used to do that
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: On both sides.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just always so like, all right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes you feel really good about going
over the border though.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like legal on either side of the
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just at that exact line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legal, but Washington it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: It definitely seems to me that they're
going to have to figure out their whole
[SPEAKER_12]: zero tolerance thing when, you know,
people are human and mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially when it comes to
medication.
[SPEAKER_12]: And pain management and all these other
things.
[SPEAKER_15]: I predict right now that, uh, uh,
commerce and money will be more important
[SPEAKER_15]: than before Americans and Canadians are
allowed to cross the border.
[SPEAKER_15]: If they're admitted cannabis users,
they're going to admit tons of cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: between Canada and America and legal will
be legal recreational.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you're a smoker, you still won't be
able to go between the damn two countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: So dumb.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so dumb and so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many Canadians that can't go
into America for that reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Americans that camp can't come into
Canada, but they can fly all over the
[SPEAKER_09]: world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mexico, Thailand doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can go anywhere, but not the goddamn
U S or Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just retarded.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Canada is the only country that
America shares its criminal database with.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they know everything about everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they know that they're not supposed to
be American when they look.
Mm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fast, it just for many years too.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can look back like, wow, you got to
get that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it'll be a nice day when we won't
have to worry about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Reciprocity is something that I'm looking
forward to in all the different cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: friendly, federally, cannabis friendly,
you know, countries that have federal
[SPEAKER_12]: programs, they should have reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should be able to fly from one of
those countries to the other and have your
[SPEAKER_15]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: And for commercial purposes, just like
wine, you should be able to buy cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, in the glass jars or however,
from anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: There should be not only interstate
business like in America, but there should
[SPEAKER_15]: be intercontinental business with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the duty free shop in the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can buy Canadian whiskey there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I buy Canadian ash?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because one is a tear on the social
fabric and one is a healer to the social
[SPEAKER_12]: fabric.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think they're more into tearing it
open.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you wait and see, Marcus, as soon as
the government is making taxes and big
[SPEAKER_15]: business is allowed to sell it,
it'll be just another business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they're doing it here.
[SPEAKER_12]: They just announced the tax on medical
cannabis will be one dollar per gram,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is, you know, it's like a that's
pretty high for for for medical.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're pretty bummed out about it here.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I bet investors were happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm sure they were.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's now that means an ounce of cannabis
at ten dollars a gram will be three
[SPEAKER_12]: hundred and twenty two dollars Canadian.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: The email.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now these guys, maybe they're not
investors.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're outvestors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Outvestors.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like the Rastafarian version
of understand is overstand.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to understand, but now I overstand.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the perspective changer right
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I forgot about these two here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another hash making couple from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: that I'm going to invite.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully we can get to talking about
some hashish.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, let's kick out on this shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: People want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: More importantly, people want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, we have come a long way, though,
I'll tell you what, in the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_12]: hashish has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We enjoyed doing some dry stuff the other
day when it was super, super low
[SPEAKER_09]: temperatures outside, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really fun to just go out at
night with a full moon, with the snow
[SPEAKER_09]: outside everywhere and set up a little
table and a little light and get out the
[SPEAKER_09]: dry stuff material and just make it just
do a quick little run.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nice and pure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they bring it in and smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a lot of fun lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: It warmed up now, but I hope it gets cold
against it.
[SPEAKER_15]: In countries like Afghanistan,
they wouldn't make hashish from their bulk
[SPEAKER_15]: grown marijuana until there was snow on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes all the sense in the world when
you're connected to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got other things to do in Afghanistan
and the hills.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like trying to save their food and
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they can just wait on that until the
snow comes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, hey, let's go back to
the hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can save tremendous amounts of
money on your ice, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they probably don't have fridges.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's way easier to wait for the air to
be the fridge than anything else.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this year I absolutely want to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you want to come up for the
solventless mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what your border scene is
like.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to sled into the back country.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to go to this many thousands of
year old ice cave, electric blue ice
[SPEAKER_12]: walls, like crazy fucking bucket list
place, and make some dry sift and do a run
[SPEAKER_12]: of bubble hash and just get in there and
make hash and film the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_12]: bring the drone, hook up with my buddy
who's got a plane, just make an absolute
[SPEAKER_12]: fucking killer video that could last the
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's that same ice cave that you're
talking about that you had film or your
[SPEAKER_00]: photos of, we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the most unbelievable photo I've
seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been on my mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: They are absolutely spectacular and
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I showed them on Hash Church or
one of my wake and bakes before.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a place to make, would be second to
none.
[SPEAKER_12]: There would be no other place to make hash
like this, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so let me just get a little picture
open to let everyone know what we're
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one's kind of surreal, this
particular one.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't even look real.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this one, I had to climb through a
very tight hole, barely a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: bigger than the size of my body to get
into this open area.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty epic little ice cave.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when are we doing it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's just a matter of enough snow
falling and then going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that ice, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I'm down as fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like super nonstop.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not easy to get there.
[SPEAKER_12]: The adventure will be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the fucking hole we had to climb
through to get into that other little
[SPEAKER_12]: zone.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you're limited for your time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything is limited because as it gets
darker, you can't be there because you'll
[SPEAKER_12]: perish if you try to stay overnight,
unless you built a little fire,
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: But look at the walls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the cave the same every year or does it
change from year to year?
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you seen any changes month to month,
dude?
[SPEAKER_12]: This gives you an idea of the entrance and
how big it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, those are six foot tall dudes.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a 30 foot, 40 foot tall.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like walking into a cathedral.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reminds me of Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, honestly, dude, it does remind you
of Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is taken from the back of the cave
with the natural light shining through the
[SPEAKER_12]: ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: That ice is like 20 feet thick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, not going to show a gazillion
more.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys get the idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what's coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been talking about it for quite a few
years, so I really have to make it happen
[SPEAKER_12]: this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And whoever wants to come, well,
you're going to have to get a sled.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're going to use thousands of year
old ice, don't you need to use thousands
[SPEAKER_15]: of year old resin?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was hoping, Sam, that you could
send me like a couple of kilos of
[SPEAKER_12]: mummified cannabis that was found in a
graveyard.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I do have some Egyptian stuff that I
found in a pyramid.
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam, put the oldest seeds I've ever held
in my life, like cannabis seeds that were
[SPEAKER_12]: like 2700 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: 2700 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: The casaric tombs found by the Synthian
graves where the seeds were found in a
[SPEAKER_15]: little leather pouch inside the grave.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just walks up to me and he's like,
here, check this out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_12]: What are those?
[SPEAKER_09]: So no one has ever grown those out,
have they or have they?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh no, I've got them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I grow them every year.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, don't be silly.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're 2700 years old.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, my God.
One?
[SPEAKER_09]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe at 2500 years, you could have got it
to pop, but come on, 2700 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was impressed when my 20 year old seed
from Jamaica popped.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was doing back flips.
[SPEAKER_12]: 2700 years old.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like, there's got to be some
machines that can extract DNA and even see
[SPEAKER_15]: if it's maybe, maybe if it was frozen that
entire time, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be good, but I wouldn't count on
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that must be out there somewhere in
the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: There must be some like thousand year
olds, cannabis seeds that are frozen in
[SPEAKER_12]: ice somewhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for several thousand years to have
never thought out, that's a bit tougher.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, maybe if it's down in the
permafrost, yeah, it could be.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're probably going to find a dude on a
mammoth up in the Arctic who like has a
[SPEAKER_09]: bag of weed seeds on him fully preserved.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to be like, whoa,
this is the guy who was like trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: save cannabis for all of existence.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was trying to save cannabis and he was
what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Killing off the mammoths?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he was riding the mammoths,
using those suckers.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like one with the mammoths.
[SPEAKER_12]: That one with the mammoth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I'd imagine those things were pretty
funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fucking wild.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even elephants, like nothing really fucks
with elephants.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the first time I landed in New
Delhi, India, which if you guys have seen
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on there right now,
man, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: The fucking smog in that city right now is
equivalent to 50 cigarettes a day,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is from all these like different
festivals that happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: So fireworks that got blown off and then
pollution from different plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all just wet.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like yellow air.
[SPEAKER_12]: Super nasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the first time I ever landed there,
I got out of the airport and flew into
[SPEAKER_12]: Calcutta, then flew to Delhi, got out of
the airport in Delhi, jumped in a cab and
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't even get out of the airport.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was an elephant walking on the
street.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was kind of like, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, India, I guess there's elephants
on the streets or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this one was actually a wild elephant
and it wasn't like being, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: attempted to being controlled by a human.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just a wild elephant that had come
out of the jungle and was walking in the
[SPEAKER_12]: city, which I guess is a little more rare.
[SPEAKER_12]: And man, were people giving this fucking
thing its, you know, distance,
[SPEAKER_12]: like those things can, they're so big.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii,
and we had that elephant escape from the
[SPEAKER_07]: circus and go on a rampage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's trainer and got out and started
running down the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to gun it down, unfortunately,
but just went psycho.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: You cage an elephant.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, that's like caging an elephant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_12]: The caged bird.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you can fly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to put you in a cage.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think of them apples?
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was living in South India in
Kerala, up in the mountains there,
[SPEAKER_15]: they still catch wild elephants like up by
Lake Pediar.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they would get a couple of
well-trained elephants, two or three of
[SPEAKER_15]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they would catch a wild elephant
and the bigger tamed elephants would force
[SPEAKER_15]: them into an area where they would
eventually calm them down and make them
[SPEAKER_15]: working elephants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it true that I heard that with
bubble hasher, there was the story,
[SPEAKER_09]: old story of monks being up in the
mountains of the Himalayas that would wash
[SPEAKER_09]: ganja in the rivers with silks?
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone ever heard this?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I've never heard that ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd be surprised if it's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: But they did wash ganja just because ganja
used to be kind of dirty and they would
[SPEAKER_15]: wash it and then smoke it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_15]: They said it made it cooler and easier on
the throat.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also they weren't washing away any of
the things that were good.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were just washing away water soluble
in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dust and debris.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen them do it many times.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you know, I looked pretty hard into
the water hash history, mainly because I
[SPEAKER_12]: was involved in litigation with a
gentleman who has a patent for water
[SPEAKER_12]: extraction, Reinhard Delp.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Reinhard Delp built this machine,
I guess, in the 90s, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe he built it in 96 or 97.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the first year he showed up at the
Cannabis Cup was in 97.
[SPEAKER_12]: He had the machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: He showed it to Mila.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mila had a couple of friends over,
one of which is Mark Rose, my
[SPEAKER_12]: manufacturer, the other which was Elden,
a longtime friend of Mark and a big
[SPEAKER_12]: hashish aficionado.
[SPEAKER_12]: He used to live in Kathmandu with Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Elden was staring at this machine,
the ice cold extractor, which is
[SPEAKER_12]: Reinhard's machine that he has the patent
on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a single screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a mixer that kind of goes down into a
funnel and you can collect the resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of unique in a sense because
Reinhard isn't trying to collect,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, all the different micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_12]: His mentality was let's do a light mixture
and allow the most mature heads to fall,
[SPEAKER_12]: the most readily available ones,
the ones that are just ready to snap with
[SPEAKER_12]: the lightest little mixture.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'll collect all of those on a
single screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's definitely a unique way of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I see that it has its place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I came from a different place where it's
like, let's deconstruct this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can always reconstruct it or
reconstruct it in any way that we choose.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it seemed like the better of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, if you're collecting everything
on one screen, you're going to have a very
[SPEAKER_12]: hard time ever trying to separate that
afterwards to experience it under the
[SPEAKER_12]: different micron diameters, which
seemingly for anyone that's smoked enough
[SPEAKER_12]: of it does produce different profiles.
[SPEAKER_12]: 45 micron is a very unique profile that
almost all cultivars produce this oily,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, large yielding, just kind of
unique, different resonance.
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, it's because of the size of the
head.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Reinhard had this machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Elden was looking at it on the couch at
Mila's and he said two five gallon size
[SPEAKER_12]: nylon bags with screen bottoms in a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've got the same thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so right then and there, the isolator
bags were born.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mark Rose was the manufacturer for those
bags out of Katmandu.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he also named the product isolator.
[SPEAKER_12]: By looking at, if you know how his brain
works, he was looking at it and he was
[SPEAKER_12]: like, he's using the ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's isolating the glands.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the isolator.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mila was going to sell them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So she became the isolator lady.
[SPEAKER_12]: She sold the bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was in 98.
[SPEAKER_12]: She sold her first bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: Less than a year after seeing that machine
as the cannabis cup, of course,
[SPEAKER_12]: is always in November, third week in
November, American Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_15]: You forgot to mention that the machine was
rather large and expensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was like a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_12]: A thousand bucks for the machine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was it was absolutely rather large.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was just that Mila and Reinhard had
sort of signed a contract in order for him
[SPEAKER_12]: to show the machine in the first place.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they all ended up starting their
own company.
[SPEAKER_12]: Elden got screwed out of everything and
never got paid a penny, which is why I
[SPEAKER_12]: used to give him his ticket to the legends
of Hashish Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if he knew that, but I would
always buy Elden's ticket for the legends.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because I felt like, geez,
the guy didn't even get anything out of
[SPEAKER_12]: it.
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've known him since 1965.
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew you knew Elden for a long time,
probably much longer than I think Mark met
[SPEAKER_12]: him in like 72 or 73 or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, you guys have known each other
the longest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess he's passed away since RIP.
[SPEAKER_12]: If everyone wants to maybe have a puff for
Hashish Aficionado Elden, that would be
[SPEAKER_12]: nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the bags got created.
[SPEAKER_12]: I came in literally less than a year later
and tried to sell isolator bags out of
[SPEAKER_12]: Canada because I had just been busted with
16 and a half pounds at a roadblock.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was kind of like, oh shit, I don't think
I can really flip pounds of weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like the east door and nobody wants to
work with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to do something else.
[SPEAKER_12]: My wife's like, can you do something that
potentially won't get us arrested and
[SPEAKER_12]: thrown in jail?
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, yes, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I went to Amsterdam to talk to Mila,
not really knowing who Mark Rose was,
[SPEAKER_12]: not really knowing who Elden was at the
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And ended up not having the best
experience, not getting sort of what I
[SPEAKER_12]: wanted and coming home and starting my own
water extraction company.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really thanks to my wife saying
she would sew the first bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how bubble bags came to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: In March of 1999, we went public and
started posting photos online.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is that first bag?
[SPEAKER_12]: In my garage.
[SPEAKER_15]: You still have it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want it?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I just think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: We should keep it in a museum.
[SPEAKER_15]: You should have your first bag that your
wife hand sewed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's very cool and it's very hilarious
to look at them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, whoa, I started a company with
these bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, it was funny because it's
all how karma works.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, because I guess Mila and Mark
just, you know, Mark was making bags for
[SPEAKER_12]: Mila, but Mila was like, oh, he's charging
too much.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess she ended up going and getting
some other bags made in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mark found out about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Mark was upset.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was maybe in 2000, 2001.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just two or three years into the.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about, that's about when we got our
first bags, but keep going.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, right around then is when Mark Rose
hit me up because he saw me doing what I
[SPEAKER_12]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was more along in lines with what
he wanted in the way of promote.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was like, man, Mila's not really
promoting it the same way.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're like passionate about this.
[SPEAKER_12]: You actually smoke it, not mixed with
tobacco, which is also very different,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, hard to promote something in
North America the way I did.
[SPEAKER_12]: If all you smoke is hashed with tobacco
and that's in no way am I putting Mila
[SPEAKER_12]: down.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's done her own work and she,
you know, she, she was a very important
[SPEAKER_12]: piece in the ladder of all of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't put anyone down in that sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just all the way karma worked
out that Mark Rose would get in touch with
[SPEAKER_12]: me because he didn't feel the business he
was doing was, was, was good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we ended up, we've been in business
together for, for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like he's been the manufacturer of bubble
bags for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I never called him Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always called him.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause he is metal Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: He makes all his own clothes out of
stinging nettle.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all handmade clothes and the
clothes are like, you know, you got to
[SPEAKER_12]: hike into the jungle for three days to
find this shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you got to like cut it down,
pound it on a big smooth stone in front of
[SPEAKER_12]: a river, get it onto an eight foot
backstrap loom, fiberize it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like these motherfuckers were doing this
shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Fabrics were made in Asia and many other
places.
[SPEAKER_15]: Flax, nettle and hemp are three textiles
that are really, really similar to each
[SPEAKER_15]: other when they're woven.
[SPEAKER_15]: And cedar bark.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I was going to say about nettle is
that there's no plowing.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no planting.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no irrigation.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's jungle.
[SPEAKER_12]: It grows live.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, it's in the jungle and it grows
big.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also no resin is what I used to
give him a hard time.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome because nettle is actually a
master plant in a really similar way that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand nettle.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've used it for a very, very long time,
but it ain't cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feeds cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows really nice cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fermentations from it help.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Biodynamic users have used nettles for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: The very first outdoor patches we grew up
in BC way long time ago back in the times
[SPEAKER_09]: that you're talking about, Marcus,
we're all done in nettle patches with
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing else but nettles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, oftentimes nine days to try to
find our nettle patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like we were looking.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Southwest facing nettle slide,
avalanche shoot with gravity fed water.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was our big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the nettles always had the good
soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nettles make good soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: You find nettles, there's good soil
underneath there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Imagine like 20 foot tall ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've only, I think the longest one I
found was 11 feet at Oregon Country Fair,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Katmandu though.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm, you know, Hey, give it up for Mandu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite of a different species too,
because when we were up in, yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: the Himalayan nettles are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're a little bit different,
a little bit more fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more spikes, way spikier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't hurt as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stinging nettle isn't as quick to
sting you is what we noticed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to sell Mark Rose's stinging nettle
clothes at my gallery at the melting
[SPEAKER_12]: point.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were the wildest fucking clothes,
like handmade stinging nettle pants.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only person to ever buy the pants,
because the pants were like the thickest
[SPEAKER_12]: craziest, like just, they were just like,
I was like, who is going to buy these
[SPEAKER_12]: pants?
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd always be like, who's it going to be?
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's going to buy these pants?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a real kind of out there,
crazy individual.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was fucking Woody Harrelson bought
those pants.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was like, dude, I need these pants.
[SPEAKER_12]: All eating the raw food at the cafe
wearing a stinging nettle pants.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, I love this place.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was unfolding at that moment in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it really was.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was like 2004.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jay Henrick says if he ever gets out of
here, he's going to Katmandu.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just don't Katmandu don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't Katmandu don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what, you want to walk us through a run
with a solventless mind?
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to give us a little like
walkthrough on when you, when you like to
[SPEAKER_12]: make your hash little, little pre,
you know, you must get your shit all
[SPEAKER_12]: ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you're not just, there is
organization to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you asking me what I do to like prep?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, after I take it out of the
freeze dryer, I'm left with this fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: powder.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like uncontrollable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like anthrax.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wants to fly in the air, even if it's
greasy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I do is I use my t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_08]: I send it like 120 degrees and I put a
piece of parchment on it that I fold like
[SPEAKER_08]: hotdog style in half.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what I'll do is I'll take the
stuff out of the jar and I'll pour it on
[SPEAKER_08]: that piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'll fold a piece of paper over
and I'll press it all down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everything gets crushed down and then
it becomes this big, Frenchy cannoli,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, it becomes Frenchy cannoli hash
big fucking, it looks full spec and
[SPEAKER_08]: flattened out without using a bottle and
turkey bags or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's the same concept.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I flatten it out like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm able to take it with my
gloves and just rip it into 30 gram or one
[SPEAKER_08]: ounce, you know, pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we just pretty much make it the
size for the bag and we put it into the
[SPEAKER_08]: bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: It works really easy that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can pour powder, but like I
said, it's going to fucking be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: We decided to stop pouring powder.
[SPEAKER_12]: And is that, is that a lower star rating
that you're pressing it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, are you, do you, you obviously grow,
make hash that's like six star that you
[SPEAKER_12]: just don't press.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're muted again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this right here is the quality that's
in the bags right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the 159 to 73.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it's, it's not like six star,
but I would say it's close to like four
[SPEAKER_08]: and a half, almost five star, like it's up
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I mean, the grower crushed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all the washes came out, fucking
retarded melty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you don't press it all into rosin then?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the melts are, are still melts.
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of want to tell the younger
generation that's up and coming that all
[SPEAKER_12]: these guys are pressing some hash right
now that rosin is amazing, but I don't
[SPEAKER_12]: know if it's the reason you would grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: For the best resin that you can get,
whether you're sifting it or whatever
[SPEAKER_12]: you're doing with it, you just want it to
be the best quality resin that you can
[SPEAKER_12]: get.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see a lot of clear what he was
showing is that dry sift or is that
[SPEAKER_15]: watershed?
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, material that's been made into rosin
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's water.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not rosin though.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is literally just, I press this out
to dab it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, uh, kind of see where it laid on my
nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, did it leave a lot of char?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it melt away?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like I judge, everything based
off the char leaves behind, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_08]: necessarily mean it's the best hash is
because it doesn't leave any char behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had stuff that leaves nothing on my
nail, but barely gets me high.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what I would consider the
best hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you like the best after you've smoked
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: I, that's why I came up with a method for
the legends and I unfortunately wasn't
[SPEAKER_12]: really able to be there to kind of
overlook it, but I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we throw legends of hash in Barcelona
this year or next year, Sam, uh,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is, which, which is what Mark Rose
used to tell me about that they would do
[SPEAKER_12]: in Kathmandu during Shivaratri that all
these Baba Sadhus would walk from all over
[SPEAKER_12]: India and Kathmandu and they'd all link up
and meet in this little spot and they'd
[SPEAKER_12]: all put like their hash that they had out
on little plates and they weren't like
[SPEAKER_12]: putting their names on it or anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: Their egos aren't trapped in all of that
sort of, uh, attachment, but you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: the best hash was just the one that got
smoked first.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, obviously the best cause it's
the one every one smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, it's the simplest, you know,
if you want to make a little bit of a kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of contest out of it, which I don't
necessarily want to, but if people want
[SPEAKER_12]: to, that to me is really a pretty
legitimate, you know, people's choice
[SPEAKER_12]: award where it's like, look, it's,
it was the one that got smoked the first,
[SPEAKER_12]: the one that everyone's eye got attracted
to the one that the nose and everything
[SPEAKER_12]: was on point.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure that, uh, at a legends though,
it might get a little bit harder in the
[SPEAKER_12]: last couple of years and really nice
things started showing up for legends,
[SPEAKER_12]: really nice things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to ask you, um, what do you
think of when Frenchy cannoli says fresh,
[SPEAKER_08]: never frozen?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he's saying not to freeze any of your
material that you should be running it
[SPEAKER_08]: fresh in the field or fresh from the
garden and not freezing it at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, it's his opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it's a legitimate opinion in
a sense, but what is the mentality behind
[SPEAKER_12]: it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is he saying that people who are freezing
it are doing it wrong?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause then that would be more than an
opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, cause to me I've run fresh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've run fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really respect Frenchy that said,
he's also of the opinion that pressed
[SPEAKER_15]: resin is better than unpressed resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, I, I have never seen that I've
seen it changes so that you might like
[SPEAKER_15]: those changes for taste and other
characteristics better, but does it
[SPEAKER_15]: scientific?
[SPEAKER_15]: We make it superior or better.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've also, that's kind of one of the main
things that, uh, that I've been in
[SPEAKER_12]: disagreements with just from what I've
seen myself, not I've never really noticed
[SPEAKER_12]: resin becoming.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's obviously a serious and knowledgeable
lover of resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hash aficionado for certain.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's, he's on side.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's on the team.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just wondering because, um,
I had seen a post that he made and I kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of got to a conversation with him because
I've tried the whole fresh, not frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a mess.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was sticky shit everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like the heads weren't even heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were literally just like grease.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was like trying to scrape oil out of
my bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just thought that like, that's not
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then he made a post and it was pretty
much saying, you know, everybody that's
[SPEAKER_08]: freezing their material, they're not doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you freeze your material,
it does this to the cell walls of the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant and this and that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it releases chlorophyll and that's why
everything gets green.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think that that's true though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I, I watched the whole plant fresh
frozen all the time and I don't see any
[SPEAKER_08]: green.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I watched some stuff and I will
get green.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I noticed it's when I'm using less
ice.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I don't have enough ice in the mix ship
will get green.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've, I've never really thought that it's
better to do one or the other.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's for me, as I get older, it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_12]: A quiver, you know, it's all about having
more options than less.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and it's definitely not all about
telling people that you're all doing it
[SPEAKER_12]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that's just a sort of a dangerous
position to get into.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to believe in your methods and
it's good to have that confidence.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it's also good to have that
humility and that humbleness that says,
[SPEAKER_12]: well, you know what, like this is what I
like.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is attached to my opinion,
not like, I'm not a scientific expert that
[SPEAKER_12]: has irrefutable proof.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so sometimes our opinions get the best
of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know when I first came out,
I was a lot more strong-minded and more,
[SPEAKER_12]: more along the lines of telling people
that very same thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas now it's like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: Make your own mistakes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you'll discover something new.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely don't know everything and I'm
learning every day as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we separate the people on the
same team, then we're just not as
powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we really need to come
together as a community and like cure
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and that we see this as something
that can heal the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of our biggest missions in life
is how to grow the best resident.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we should definitely be talking
all there is about, you know, extracting
[SPEAKER_09]: it, but without being able to grow the
right resident, exactly how to do that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, it's the most important part of
the puzzle, really.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I myself personally, I love.
[SPEAKER_15]: Older, more mature plant resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: In other words, a little bit past when you
might pick it for, for smells and flavors.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I'm picking it for resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I want it as big and mature as
possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also like it.
[SPEAKER_15]: In other words, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was loud.
[SPEAKER_15]: But also a little bit, uh, drier than many
people.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it dried for two weeks and that
cured for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then the resin is easily to work with
unless it's super, super, super,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, gooey resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, I, I, I like to work with dry
sip.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also, when, when I made resin,
I, I separated it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did it in a freezer, even after the
material had been dried for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also.
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, cured for several months.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we have a walk-in freezer for
the bubble man brand.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, although Tony was starting to do the
washing in the freezer, I told him,
[SPEAKER_12]: dude, that's completely unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the bags themselves will be cold
enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just for working with the resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: The walk-in freezer is a real just joy.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really primarily to prevent
smearing of the resin to try to keep it as
[SPEAKER_15]: intact as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which lasts right up until you put it in
your little container.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like a lot of people these days are
pulling their plants early because they
[SPEAKER_08]: can hype the color of their hash or their
rosin, but they don't understand that like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No high shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter how pretty it looks.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it doesn't get me high, I really don't
give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I especially had the prices that these
motherfuckers charge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't imagine paying a hundred
dollars for a gram of something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get high like three times for
15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I couldn't imagine that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's a really important part of the
conversation actually that you brought up
[SPEAKER_12]: because we talked about that a little bit
the other day that you see the resin
[SPEAKER_12]: behind me here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see the colors on the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see the color on the water hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see the color on the rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, these were all exceptional,
exceptional smokes.
[SPEAKER_12]: The, uh, the dry sift is actually skunk
man Sam's, uh, skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the water hash is, um, the master
scout, I believe from, uh, West coast
[SPEAKER_12]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the rosin and it was some rosin
that I pressed out using some of the hash
[SPEAKER_12]: having that color to me, like as a
photographer, the second everyone started
[SPEAKER_12]: using freeze dryers, um, I was no longer
really interested in taking pictures of
[SPEAKER_12]: the resident.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why this is, and I'm not
sure, you know, exactly what it is that's
[SPEAKER_12]: going on, but for whatever reason,
when I photograph resin, that's been
[SPEAKER_12]: freeze dried, it's full of capitate
stocks, like unbelievable amounts of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they seem to be almost artifacts of
the actual or shadows of their former
[SPEAKER_12]: self.
[SPEAKER_12]: They seem to be almost like the shape in
the lightest, you know, type of cellulose,
[SPEAKER_12]: like just thin, thin, thin.
[SPEAKER_12]: They, it's like, they're not even there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't affect the melt.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't really affect the, the,
the high, but the photographs I just
[SPEAKER_12]: stopped photographing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, freeze dried resin with my macro lens,
because I felt that it would just make the
[SPEAKER_12]: people who are making the hash look bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, it's, uh, it's weird,
you know, when you, when you dry hash
[SPEAKER_12]: properly and you cure it and you,
you pull that water out slowly with a
[SPEAKER_15]: desk.
[SPEAKER_15]: In church, we always say cleanliness is
next to godliness.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You said that to me, like one of the first
times I ever met you, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was, uh, it stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I can hear you saying that.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first, one of the first times I ever,
uh, you know, met you in a way that I was
[SPEAKER_12]: actually talking to you, not like someone,
because I met you a few times prior to
[SPEAKER_12]: that, that you definitely would.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's assuming you already have the resin
that you love.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then what you want to do is make it as
clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys made it in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dobis family.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Jessica.
[SPEAKER_12]: I keep forgetting your name.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel terrible.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to miss.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I also feel like the,
uh, the freeze dryer just powder rises the
[SPEAKER_08]: hash where it's like microplaning and
shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't, it doesn't really powder rise
it like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't fly into the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hear it like, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you can hear the resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when you, when you dump it off a
paper into the jar, you hear the,
[SPEAKER_08]: the, the resin, like regular sugar,
you know, rolling down the paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Into the jar when you rot, like freeze dry
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sounds like fucking dust,
just kind of moving down the paper and you
[SPEAKER_08]: can kind of see it just kind of like going
in the air, even if it's the same quality
[SPEAKER_08]: as the stuff that you microplans.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's another thing that confuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you have cutting them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to try to control, to control
that static energy that's sending the dust
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they still sell these
things, but those of us who are old enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to remember turntable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The record players, they used to sell this
little static gun that you could basically
[SPEAKER_01]: knock out the static electricity on your
record play or on your record that you
[SPEAKER_01]: were turning on a turntable because that
would lead sometimes to popping and noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what I find is that when you're
weighing out a very flocculent solid like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that tends to be just dispersed by
static electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do is you can use one of
those little spark guns, basically to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove the static electricity and see if
that helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's the static electricity.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like even when you take it out of
the freeze dryer and you dump it from the
[SPEAKER_08]: tray paper into the sieve and you just
start shaking the sieve back and forth,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can just see the shit just fucking
flying away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's similar to taking a
blown up balloon and rubbing it on your
[SPEAKER_01]: head and having the static electricity
hold the balloon to the side of your
[SPEAKER_01]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but that, that should not be
happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you there's something that's
getting taken out of that resin that we
[SPEAKER_12]: don't want to be taking out of it to turn
it into a fluffy talcum like powder.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like the, that's like the,
the telltale sign of shitty dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we clean out of our dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's, it's got me a little freaked out
the, the, the freeze dry tech and how many
[SPEAKER_12]: people have jumped on the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know when Tony got one for the brand,
I told him, listen, I'm down with
[SPEAKER_12]: experimenting and playing with this,
but I want to have absolute five and six
[SPEAKER_12]: star, but it's still cured out the way I
like to cure it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's something to be said about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, well, what was said before,
what was said before about the phenomena
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of in fresh frozen, when you actually
freeze the plant material, that material,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, the water, the water
that's associated, I'm sorry, the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for muting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water associated with the plant cells will
begin to freeze and will begin to rupture
[SPEAKER_01]: cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is absolutely known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could actually see this under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps Marcus, and this is just a
theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any evidence to support this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That again, the, the leaf is a part of the
plant that basically exudes this waxy
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps the freezing of the water at
the base of the leaf is what's leading to
[SPEAKER_01]: the loss of the, of the whole triton as
opposed to just the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe again, the expansion that's
caused by water freezing, most liquids
[SPEAKER_01]: when they freeze actually contract,
but water, because of its hydrogen bonding
[SPEAKER_01]: actually forms larger ice crystals than
the volume of water from which it was
[SPEAKER_01]: derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that change in volume, that's why a
soda will explode, explode in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That change in volume might be the
mechanical force that's disrupting the
[SPEAKER_01]: interface between the waxy portion of the
trichome and a continuous structure of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, which is very hydrophilic and very
water loving and very water-like as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to the waxy trichome, which is
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even when you separate dry sift resin and
you've got it dry, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_15]: and you've got it separated so that it's a
50, 60, 70, 90% resin heads.
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be very, very hydrophilic,
I believe is a proper word, which means it
[SPEAKER_15]: can absorb the water from the atmosphere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually, that phenomena is not
called hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually called hygroscopic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a dried organic material absorbs
ambient moisture from the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's called hygroscopic.
[SPEAKER_15]: It really depends on the variety of resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some varieties are incredibly so.
[SPEAKER_15]: Other varieties, they really just don't do
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's dependent on the terpene that
contents the resin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the real chemical differentiation
in between necessarily cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the terpenes and which ones are
there and at what levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that, you know, freeze drying
food as opposed to like drying food or sun
[SPEAKER_00]: drying food, you know, they do a lot of
tests on freeze drying, just food,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it loses a tremendous amount of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's nothing really left in freeze
dried foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of a side note, but something
that's been tested and true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to explain, like if I take my
90 bag and I microplane it, all right,
[SPEAKER_08]: I freeze the patty and I microplane it,
it will never ever be the same as the
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff, the 90 that I put into the freeze
dryer, the stuff that comes out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: freeze dryer is like anthrax.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will go airborne right out of the
fucking freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you can grab the sides of the paper
and just crunch it in on itself and you
[SPEAKER_08]: can see dust flying off.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the same 90 that I'm talking about
though, that I also froze and microplane
[SPEAKER_08]: and it won't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can literally fold the paper over on
itself and I can hit it with a metal,
[SPEAKER_08]: I have this metal block for a rosin flower
press and I'll hit it with the block and
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll just break everything down in the
powder, but still it will not lift off of
[SPEAKER_08]: the paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even after completely raping it,
you know, like with the metal block.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't understand why the freeze dry
material wants to float.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he's explained a few things,
but it still doesn't make sense to me
[SPEAKER_08]: because like the metal seed isn't going to
create any type of static.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like just dumping those chunks into a
seed and then shaking it and it just
[SPEAKER_08]: dusting without you even using a spoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You literally just shake the seed back and
forth, but the particles that are flying
[SPEAKER_08]: into the air, you always need to wear a
mask.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise you'll be breathing that shit
in, but it doesn't happen with microplane
[SPEAKER_08]: tash is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's gotta be a temperature that,
you know, it's breaking down the resins
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you get it that cold,
you know, there's probably it's breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down the resins and that's exactly what
happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: It could also be a difference in
volatiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: If volatiles are released, it will change
the basic nature of the resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, check this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right, Sam.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was me that said fuck by the way.
[SPEAKER_12]: For those of you wondering, okay,
here's a photo.
[SPEAKER_12]: It took me a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is West Coast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is they make beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is their hash right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Same, same everything except freeze dried.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at this shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't even post it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, yeah, it looks like it's 20%
capitate stock.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not posting that, but it is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's every fucking freeze dried bubble
hash that I put under my, under my You
[SPEAKER_12]: can't see it.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I can see it, but it looks like it has
a lot of contaminants in it, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it looks like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You absolutely know there's a lot of
contaminants in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can just see that's not smooth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at all that fucking contaminant.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's that's an enormous amount for a
melty for a melty hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it because the resin heads have been
shredded and it somehow makes it look like
[SPEAKER_15]: it's not pure resin?
[SPEAKER_15]: And heads, but it actually is.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's definitely not pure resin heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why the, why, when you like,
I just don't understand it enough,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's a conversation that I want to
make sure we're having because you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also not overly sold on the freeze
dryer.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this it's funny too,
because once I've got my resin separated
[SPEAKER_15]: and dried and cured and separated,
I freeze it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how I keep it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like it was the day I froze it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know what, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, but it's different than what you're
talking about for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I've photographed frozen heads and
you know, frozen heads that have been,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, thawed out and I've never seen
them like break.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never seen them shred or crack or,
or do any of these things under my micro
[SPEAKER_12]: lens.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I remember when people were
microplaning and I was saying,
[SPEAKER_12]: you're shredding the heads and they were
like, no, no, we're not shredding the
[SPEAKER_12]: heads.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, oh no, you're shredding the
heads on wet hash and mixing the oil from
[SPEAKER_12]: the inside of the heads with the water.
[SPEAKER_12]: I promise you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, just take the macro lens,
get it out and, and look at it under the
[SPEAKER_12]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it looks like little like diamonds
because the heads have been shredded,
[SPEAKER_12]: very different from sieving.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't say that sieve, microplaning
is, is wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just prefer personally, I prefer
personally to, to leave my heads intact.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want them to get, to get shredded
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I only microplane if I can't see,
you know, some stuff is just fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't, there's just, it ain't going
through a sieve.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a fuck how cold the room is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It don't matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as you mash that spoon down,
you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, you said it.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the fuck up, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause you don't know there's certain stuff
comes out and it's such a high quality,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's pressing it with gravity,
just sitting there in the patty before you
[SPEAKER_12]: do anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you just tap it a little bit,
you're like, oops, it's like hard,
[SPEAKER_12]: like bubble gum or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, yeah, I've, I've put it into a
sieve and gone like this with the spoon
[SPEAKER_12]: and just watched it go smear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I always test it out right out
of the bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take my finger and I'll just get a
little tiny bit of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll kind of squeeze it hard between my
fingers, get the water away from it and
[SPEAKER_08]: then start trying to roll it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it just creases in my fingers,
it's not going in the seat, but if it
[SPEAKER_08]: rolls up into a ball, there's a chance
that it is a chance.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_14]: The sides deceived.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just let it cure.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean after I see for
microplane?
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's too greasy, what do you do with
it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Microplane.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Microplanes it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'll do is I'll freeze all my
patties.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make them small and I'll freeze them
all, but I won't freeze them until I've
[SPEAKER_08]: got almost all the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I do is I take my 25 micron,
uh, pressing screen and I just put the
[SPEAKER_08]: hash on it or in a paper towel underneath
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll fold a paper towel up a few times
and I'll make sure the Patty is sitting
[SPEAKER_08]: on, um, an actual paper towel on the
pressing screen and I'll leave it in my
[SPEAKER_08]: refrigerator and then I'll keep swapping
the paper towel out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like every 20 minutes I'll put another
paper towel underneath it in the fridge
[SPEAKER_08]: though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Allow most of the moisture to come out of
the Patty because the last thing you want
[SPEAKER_08]: to do when you're microplaning is
microplane ice cubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to microplane frozen hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to have ice water in the
mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your best bet is to use the paper
towels until you've raked almost every bit
[SPEAKER_08]: of the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then take those patties and put them into
your freezer.
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point, after they're completely
frozen, you'll be able to microplane it
[SPEAKER_08]: with ease.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you leave too much water in,
it was going to be a nightmare for you to
[SPEAKER_08]: microplane.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to feel like you're literally
taking an ice cube and trying to shave it
[SPEAKER_08]: with a fucking cheese grater.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the hash will end up sizzling good
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want no sizzle in the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, boom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Knowledge drop dabs for days.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, how about a bong rip for the whole
panel and the rest of the audience as
[SPEAKER_14]: well?
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's, uh, let's do this mother lovers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add another comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's relevant,
but remember when you, when you freeze,
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that are derived from
different materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly the waxy trichome is very,
very different than the leaf and the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and the rest of the cellular structure of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When things freeze, they have different,
um, uh, thermal conductivities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they, they, they have different,
uh, so not all things contract the same
[SPEAKER_01]: rate, not all things expand the same rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the freezing process itself
is basically just fracturing the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: of the leaf from, from the, from the waxy
trichome in non-specific fracturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, these two things,
if you look at the chemical content of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in the trichome and the chemical
content of what's in the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're very, very different
when they freeze, they're going to freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to contract and expand
at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those contractions and expansions are
the reason why, um, they're, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to separate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, as the horse on Ren and Stimpy used
to say, no, sir.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to brush my teeth and then
head over to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'll reconnect at the lab so everyone
can say, hi, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to just clear up on hash church
TV here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not own Indra's extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that this was, uh, said a bunch
of times on episode one 60 that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't own Indra's extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A client of mine does come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it ever does come online, we'll hear
more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop asking me about Indra's extractor
because I don't have one.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I think, I think, uh, it was
implied that you had one delivered to us.
[SPEAKER_15]: To a client of yours in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Indra.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually his, uh, life partner there,
Annie had a pretty bad aneurysm stroke
[SPEAKER_12]: recently and is in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_12]: So our thoughts are with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that she is getting better and
feeling better.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a big scare for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see you on a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good, Mark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did Jessica and Andrew make it back?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on with those guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: So when people wash their buds off and
they, and they, they're getting the water
[SPEAKER_09]: soluble contaminants off of it,
aren't they potentially also taking water
[SPEAKER_09]: soluble trichomes off or not trichomes,
water soluble properties off the outside
[SPEAKER_09]: of the trichomes as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they might be, but if you've got old
nasty dried squash to buds, like the
[SPEAKER_15]: Indians often did, then, uh, maybe,
uh, do the advantages outweigh the
[SPEAKER_15]: disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something to be said.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just talking about a lot of people
online doing fresh buds right out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: thing into water and doing all this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, Oh water too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't do it in cold water.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the key.
Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Marcus and I, uh, heard about it from
saddus in India.
[SPEAKER_15]: They all said, you know, you don't wash
your, your, uh, ganja before you put it in
the water.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't put it in a chillum.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say, no, you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they would explain to me why we'd be
like, first of all, we're not putting any
[SPEAKER_12]: ganja in this chillum.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, that's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I, I, I would like to hear from saddus
why they were washing their ganja before
[SPEAKER_15]: they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they would explain to me, then they
would explain to me why they, uh,
[SPEAKER_15]: did what they did with a Cobra venom or,
uh, scorpion tails or any other
[SPEAKER_15]: psychoactive substance that they were
ingesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting conversation because
it seems like it's sort of like the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with, uh, fresh buds to get the
contaminants off, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one thing that I'm concerned about is
that, you know, the cure is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we cure our weed is super
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you're really getting rid of a lot
of that cyanobacteria that digests a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nitrogen, which helps to make a
really nice cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another conversation,
you know, if you're not going to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: directly into hash right away,
but you're, here are your flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, washing it might be getting rid
of that, those important bacteria.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not talking about the Indian ganja.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about like people right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of the ganja sold in India is what is
called a pressed ganja.
[SPEAKER_15]: The buds after that, you've got a bunch of
buds that are dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_15]: They walk on them and they press them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for transport and for long-term
storage, it works better in those
[SPEAKER_15]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't agree with it, but that's the way
it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's some processes here,
you know, cause we do a microbial testing
[SPEAKER_07]: and I have personally walked onto farms
and seen people spraying their buds down
[SPEAKER_07]: with hydrogen peroxide as soon as they
come out of that little trimmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like, makes me cringe a
little PM action.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they just do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, just, just, just to be safe,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hydrogen peroxide make it bubble a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's, it's obviously diluted in
water, but you know, it's, it's just a
[SPEAKER_07]: practice I've seen used just to ensure
that they pass microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to see really nice,
good cured weed that's been fresh washed
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, or that they've used hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it will be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I'm saying it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really know about how those
microbes work in the curing process to
[SPEAKER_00]: make that, you know, bud as beautiful as
it is, you know, cyanobacteria stays on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant its entire life so that it can
be able to help cure the weed when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always, I always wondered what it did to
the trichomads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to that outer layer,
that outer waxy layer kind of breaking it
[SPEAKER_09]: down a little bit, you know, it's going to
start that breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like taking off that protective
coating for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that how you get the full melt
though?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the big secret.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just getting messages over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to actually show for any of you
guys that have traveled in Nepal or in
[SPEAKER_12]: India, you know, when you meet the smoker
babas, the babas who are real hashish
[SPEAKER_12]: aficionados, they tend to have these
really cool handmade bags, these really
[SPEAKER_12]: thick, thick bags that they make.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have the Rudraksha hanging off of
them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was gifted one years ago by my
manufacturer from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is, this is a very thick,
thick handmade.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nettle.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is all stinging nettle right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this, this probably took close to a
year for this baba to make this bag.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hey, he put in bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: On the back there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got like the little, it's just a
really beautiful bag that you go to India
[SPEAKER_12]: and you'll always see the big puffer
sadhus with one of these on their
[SPEAKER_12]: shoulder.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always something good to be had on
the inside of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it felt like I had to share that little
thing that I had not seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Still in great shape.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we were in Rishi Kesh, we were,
you know, hanging out with the sadhus and
[SPEAKER_09]: they all had really bad coughs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like really kind of like,
well, I could smoke with them or maybe
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just like not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just have your own sari that you place on
the chillum each time in your own hand,
[SPEAKER_12]: like a little wet piece of cloth that
just, you know, and then obviously it's
[SPEAKER_12]: India.
[SPEAKER_15]: So India style, you need a saffi and you,
you could share, you could share with a
[SPEAKER_15]: chillum with anybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: And your lips never touch the same place
that their lips touch and saffi keeps you
[SPEAKER_15]: isolated.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's very, very safe.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if the coughing is being caused by
what they're smoking, then I can
[SPEAKER_15]: understand your fear to smoke with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, coming from my health
background, you know, they definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them did have tuberculosis sores
on their backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tuberculosis is quite rampant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you want to be,
you know, real careful of when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not worried travelers by any
means.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've taken our son all over the world
with no vaccine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've, I've smoked to Jones with not only
tuberculosis patients, but also people
[SPEAKER_15]: with active elephantitis or, or,
or let's say, I mean, there is,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you smoke a chillum properly with a
saffi, there, there is no sharing of
[SPEAKER_15]: germs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I, I smoked many a chillums with
many people in India and still have nice
[SPEAKER_12]: healthy lungs.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I feel good about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't want to get some tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_12]: No fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I was pretty pissed when buddy
cut my leg in India, breaking the blood
[SPEAKER_12]: skin barrier.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a whole other ball game.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was pissed.
[SPEAKER_12]: The scissors were like sticking out of his
overstuffed bag, walking along the Ganges,
[SPEAKER_12]: all stuffed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stuffed with people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he just opened the side of my leg up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I thought it was going to need
stitches.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just kind of should go lick some dirty
knives while I'm at it here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, what do you got there?
[SPEAKER_12]: Little, little rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that bike?
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you guys question?
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you're on mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's the Holy grail talking about
proper trichromes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has grown 12 and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice and dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really gassy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got like, uh, what did we get about,
get about 26% return on this Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely one that, that started us
off right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The right genetic for squishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you say 26%, is that from manicured
buds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang dried.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, it's usually hang dried for about
10 to 14 days, then hand trimmed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, then manicured, then,
uh, we keep cured them for about another
[SPEAKER_06]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's about a month before they come out
of the room, uh, ready to do anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you guys are loving that M1.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely putting a lot of use into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely going to be using that lifetime
warranty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took us three months to go through a
Chinese one.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not too bad actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, squishing a pound a week
or so.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Squishing a pound a week.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, like you said earlier, it's all
about being able to grow the right resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many people just are not
growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The proper resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, uh, I guess it'll just be the way it
is forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like it is with everything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's some people that want to
do it quicker than others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people are willing to take the
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, you know, if you look at the
established industries that already exist,
[SPEAKER_15]: for example, wine, that there are wineries
that produce the ultimate grape,
[SPEAKER_15]: what they do is they, uh, they never
fertilize their plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't, they prune back their plants
to get a lower yield of superior grapes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what they make their wine with.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it'll be the same thing with hashish
producers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, what you want is not only the
ultimate clone and the ultimate variety of
[SPEAKER_15]: resin, but you want to produce it the
ultimate way.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then extract it the ultimate way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not asking too much, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's also looking for genetics
that, that not, don't necessarily yield as
[SPEAKER_06]: much in flower, but have more yield and
resin and better aromas and things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we, we hunt our, for our Finos with,
with, with our nose and with, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: quality more than with quantity,
you know, we're not looking for that
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic that's going to produce three
pounds a light.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want something that it's going to
produce just good flavors and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and, and be really nice to squish.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's, that's what separates sort
of the two groups right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: The people who are willing to put in that
work, the people who are willing to learn
[SPEAKER_12]: from their mistakes and acknowledge that
what they're making isn't the best that it
[SPEAKER_12]: could be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, those are the people that are going to
continue to innovate and move forward and,
[SPEAKER_12]: and you know, not stop until they either
create or find that cultivar that they
[SPEAKER_12]: want, uh, learn all of the techniques that
are required to allow that plant to
[SPEAKER_12]: express itself to its maximum,
uh, potential.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also truly, uh, two different
marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's the quality market, and then
there's the quantity market and,
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, both the growers and sellers that
they're focused on different things
[SPEAKER_15]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's nothing wrong with either,
except for that quality has always been my
[SPEAKER_15]: holy grail over quantity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the quantity market is much
larger, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just look at any aspect of any market
and the quantity market is always the
[SPEAKER_12]: bigger marketplace.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, it's McDonald's versus,
you know, really high-end.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I love when you're looking at this
Ross and press right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not fucking around.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's probably 30 grams of that,
uh, beautiful hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: He posted one the other day that was
flowing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you just, it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Spirit extracts.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the fold.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the fold a little directional.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your temp at trade secret?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't tell you, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you promise not to tell anybody,
it's room temperature.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's doing those room temperature presses.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still so much more left in that
puck too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at 225 right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you flip that thing in half at least
once and press it again?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all go in for a second press.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this stays on its own.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many times will you fold that screen
that you just pulled out?
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you fold it once and press it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause if you're trying to do any more than
that, you're going to end up ripping the
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking paper because the press.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a good even press anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once you make it too, too fat and thick.
[SPEAKER_15]: The second press.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you do it at a higher temperature or at
a higher pressure or same temperature,
[SPEAKER_08]: same pressure and she's still squirts.
[SPEAKER_15]: Same pressure, same temp.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you did use a higher temperature or a
higher pressure, would you get more or
[SPEAKER_15]: then the first or you understand what I'm
asking?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you might get a little bit more,
but it'll be a lot more degraded at that
[SPEAKER_08]: point.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll start de-carving it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll get dark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that looks pretty darn nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done some testing and I've actually
had second presses come back higher THC
[SPEAKER_07]: than the first press.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why, but it's kind of how it
happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe because there's less terpenes
because they went off with the first
[SPEAKER_15]: press.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does make sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that we got a couple of people
squishing rosin in the room.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good fun.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm smoking some rosin, but I don't
have a press other than one of those
[SPEAKER_15]: little hair curler presses that I've had
for ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those get the job done.
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn, I can't believe I managed to be
standing for two hours so far.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tell you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just working that hip, working that hip.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_12]: It hurts and I want to cry.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got this in from West Coast Concentrates a
few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little can of Clamp action.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: West Coast Concentrates?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was from Dry Sift Western
or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name's Courtney Ivy, the guy that I've
been communicating with.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a few different fires in the
burner.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to keep track of them all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because I know both of those guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: He also sent me a Dry Sift kit that he
makes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Midwestern Dry Sift, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Midwest Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel terrible because I've never been
able to use the actual kit that he sent me
[SPEAKER_12]: because he lacquered the wood frame and I
won't put resin near the lacquer.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been off gassing for the last year
straight.
[SPEAKER_15]: So Marcus, as far as I know, the Sadhus
and the folks up in the Himalayas,
[SPEAKER_15]: they're not hip to rosin yet, are they?
[SPEAKER_15]: They're hip to a lot of other cannabis
products, but they know Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_15]: They know water hash, I think,
from you, but they don't know rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think rosin in India and the
Himalayas is much like rosin in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's hash, it comes out black.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just doesn't look great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I pressed hash in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, man, I don't even want to
smoke this.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you press the bud and you get
that golden oil, then there's something to
[SPEAKER_15]: be said for... Yeah, no, that's what I was
referring to, but I didn't even think of
[SPEAKER_15]: pressing their hand-rubbed hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking herb, but I hadn't heard of
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody doing it or knowing of it,
the knowledge had not spread back there
[SPEAKER_15]: yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Electricity is a problem, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I follow a guy on Instagram called the
Himalayan Connection, and he's obviously
[SPEAKER_12]: in the Himalayan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks can be deceiving.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know what city he's in?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, like Himachal Pradesh somewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got beautiful photos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Makua Ganj.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he Makua Ganj?
[SPEAKER_12]: Base Camp 1 around 2600.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's one of his photos.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is his Instagram here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I've seen a lot of hand-rubbed hash
that was just inferior, and this seems
[SPEAKER_15]: like if you could get good ganja in
theory, you could make great rosin.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last time we were in the Parvati Valley up
in Kassel, we were sitting in the
[SPEAKER_09]: restaurant smoking weed because it's the
one place in all of India you can smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: weed in public.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was this baldish guy there from
Spain who had a backpack on, and he'd been
[SPEAKER_09]: there for five months just making bubble
hash up in Malana and Rashol.
[SPEAKER_09]: He wasn't doing rosin, so it doesn't
answer the rosin question, but he was
[SPEAKER_09]: super stoked to go up into the villages
and make bubble hash after they were done,
[SPEAKER_09]: sometimes after they were done with
rubbing or even before.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was definitely bubble hash man from
Spain, sitting there for months at a time
[SPEAKER_09]: every fall.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I hope he does it before because
after they've hand-rubbed it, they've
[SPEAKER_15]: smeared it up pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's my buddy in the Himalayas with his
bubble bag, so he's also doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he from Spain?
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know him as an Instagram person.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't talk to him.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen his face.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know his accent.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's using buds, correct, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take off, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many blessings to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Abe, we'll give you a shout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep gratitude for you for having this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be thinking and sending healing
thoughts to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to maybe see you next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring my table if you're still
hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring my needles.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a table.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you do?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll bring my needles and some
cupping.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_12]: Say hi to the family.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, after we saw Roger Waters,
they came over to the house, and we
[SPEAKER_12]: squished for like two hours, had the
sasquatch on the kitchen table,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we were just squishing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that fucking drip on solventless
mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just focus on that for a little bit
because that's just a beautiful thing,
[SPEAKER_12]: really.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my God, I want to see an
industrial one that produces kilos at a
[SPEAKER_12]: shot.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no reason why there can't be,
you know, that same exact thing just with
[SPEAKER_12]: like instead of 30 grams of hash put in
like three kilos or a big wheel where it
[SPEAKER_15]: just as long as you keep feeding it,
it keeps squishing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, I got two 30-gram sacks on top
of each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're looking great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really, really quite enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hypnotic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what the chat room has to say
about this because I haven't even checked
[SPEAKER_12]: on them for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are they saying?
[SPEAKER_12]: What a beautiful couple.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always rinse before picking acupuncture
is the shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, that's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: The new yellow river.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Rosinfall.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's pretty beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we wanted to see right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is so good.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just toss your hash into the press.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fucking dying over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a squishing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maple butter's like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: 60 grams.
[SPEAKER_12]: The most I ever did actually was I think
40 grams in one screen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I pressed it and got like,
I don't know what it was, 26 or 27 grams.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was like, I haven't really gone back
to doing any really big, big, big ones
[SPEAKER_12]: since then.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's nice to see this thing is how
long have you squished this for?
[SPEAKER_12]: Three minutes, two minutes?
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably going close to four or five.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just flowing so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at it now coming out a lighter color
than a darker color.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unreal, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a medallion right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what I've been waiting for in the
sense like, BHO is just never my thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just never had an interest in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to float down that little river and
waterfall in a tube.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck the tube.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to go right in with a snorkel.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a plant breeder and grower,
what I think of course is how can I make
[SPEAKER_15]: individual resin heads that are the size
of a watermelon or at least a grape?
[SPEAKER_15]: We could start with grapes and work up to
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just picking them off.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you just pick one and you squeeze out a
rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: You could probably just stick a straw in
it like a juice box.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that medallion.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a nice little disk of rosin right
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating
crackers, did you say?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I also would not kick it out of bed for
eating crackers.
[SPEAKER_14]: That could get away with anything it
wanted to get away with.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe how good, yummy that
looks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just want to scoop it and have a rip.
[SPEAKER_12]: BONG RIP!
[SPEAKER_12]: Ron Jones said that's bubble man's
toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I get cotton mouth just looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to smoke some fucking shit
right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to have a BONG RIP looking at this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks a lot like Where's My Bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really does look a lot like Where's My
Bike resin.
[SPEAKER_14]: What a color.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, have you pressed that stuff and got
THCA out of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is some of the stuff that if I
press it a lower temp, I'll get the THCA
[SPEAKER_08]: right on the paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Will that stay consistently the way it
looks or will it butter out?
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it have high delimiting?
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll definitely butter out, but it won't
be that fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't happen overnight type shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes a good four or five days sitting
out at room temp to start to butter and
[SPEAKER_08]: then it turns into a sugary, wet
consistency.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you freeze it immediately, does it
prevent it from buttering out?
[SPEAKER_15]: Until you take it into room temperature?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I do have some that's in the jar
that is in the fridge that went right into
[SPEAKER_08]: the fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it kind of keeps it in its state,
but by the time you get it soft enough to
[SPEAKER_08]: get it out of the jar and actually be able
to dab it, you're going to end up with
[SPEAKER_08]: problems anyway because it'll pretty much
be glass.
[SPEAKER_15]: So freezing it will not keep it in the
state it is in now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, double pox.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it will.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely will.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely will keep it in the state
that it's in right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like I said, if you want to dab some,
you're going to have to let it thaw just
[SPEAKER_08]: to be able to get some to dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to go through those
different changes anyway.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to understand the flux.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: That really is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hilarious because this is what I'm
working with.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to do all this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've only just begun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's only just begun.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you need a continuous operation
that's a wheel instead of a press.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you just stick it in and when it takes
two or three minutes to go around the
[SPEAKER_15]: entire wheel, and then it's done.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, nice collection like way to collect
though, like not have to like peel it off
[SPEAKER_12]: parchment and shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just let it drip into a puck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that definitely puts our squish to
shame.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see your squish.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was 10 grams of holy grail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us about 2.5, 2.6 grams.
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 grams of herb.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, it looks good as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, very terpy, very gassy.
[SPEAKER_16]: About to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're about to try it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Slather Nathan Valdez in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: He says slather me in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so Marcus in Canada, they're saying in
July recreational will be legal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, July 2018.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're gearing up for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder what day in July.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious because my birthday is in
July.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, wouldn't that be interesting?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on your birthday.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that would be funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've just said July of 2018.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I told you before my my
grandmother.
[SPEAKER_15]: My mother on my father's side was a
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
Yeah.
Canadianos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit, that was a squish right there,
man.
[SPEAKER_12]: 60 grams of like four and four plus star
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to take off, guys, but I just wanted
to say thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for coming on chatting with us.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I'll be keeping it going
too, too much longer as I am in pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for coming on and please come
back again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope to someday smoke with some of
that beautiful stash you have with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're always welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Spokane.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's getting to be a little bit more than
I can handle.
[SPEAKER_12]: I might have to call it a day here soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you said you're only going to take it
a couple of hours or so and you're at two
[SPEAKER_05]: fifteen, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're hurt and seriously get off
your feet and go relax.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get your x-rays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always next week, buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're going to Apple Store.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go get your x-rays.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have an appointment for the Apple Store
that I'm going to skip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then let's do a bong hit and get out
of here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bong rip, motherlovers.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he's going.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you going to the Apple Store for,
Marcus?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I have I want to go for my little
laptop computer that's not really going
[SPEAKER_12]: online.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't let me do Hashtag Church.
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't let me even do like a FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it needs to be sorted out here quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Warranty is going to run out soon,
and I'd rather get it in before it's done.
[SPEAKER_12]: One more press going on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Solventless Mind is going to press us
right out of this room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll hit a little water hash because it's
delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that down presser man?
[SPEAKER_12]: Down presser man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Peter Tosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Tosh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this catch after this.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I definitely appreciate the invite
though, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get you back, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have more conversations.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not at my 100% today, but it was good.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was nice to have you on.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was nice to watch you press some rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now all I can hope is this one goes
smooth.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you're killing the game,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks wicked.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're inspiring all of us.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it gets a little scary stacking back
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, of course it does.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make a YouTube video where it
shows me pressing, but instead of really
[SPEAKER_15]: pressing resin, what you're doing is
you're just squeezing like a gallon of
[SPEAKER_15]: honey through a cloth.
[SPEAKER_15]: The ones you guys are doing make me so
jealous.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make you jealous.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Be like, look what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_12]: Had you known about this technology a
while ago?
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Things could have been crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: It just works like a dream.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it really does.
[SPEAKER_12]: Without the exposure to a nasty chemical
solvent, I just think it's fucking great
[SPEAKER_12]: to produce something so nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the ultimate use for farmers hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: That truly is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's pretty fun to even put in great
hash too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Ron Jones, your most welcome 70s
mama.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone who is watching, thank you all
for watching this Sunday, first Sunday in
[SPEAKER_12]: a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try and get at it next week.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully I'll be in better shape than I
am this week.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, look at that drip, drippity
drip, hash church, 161.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I'm in butter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for coming out guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: P420K, Johnny B, dragonfly, earth
medicine, Abe Frohman.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give thanks to everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Solventless mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: And me, well, I'm bubble man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love this shit too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy to bring it to all of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the meantime, may the FOMEL bless
your bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really, really, really mean that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peace out, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you later, Mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ciao.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
Thank you.
