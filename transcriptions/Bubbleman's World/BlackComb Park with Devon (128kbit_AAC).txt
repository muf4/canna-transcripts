[SPEAKER_21]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_21]: I am up here in Whistler, British Columbia
staying at the Westin Hotel, one of my
[SPEAKER_21]: favorite digs to stay at while I'm up
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've got a little bit of a fun day
today, my buddy B-Rad's birthday.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think he's 31.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go up to the Whistler
Blackcomb Park on Blackcomb Mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, there's two parks, one on either
mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: And just get some footage, you know,
get some pictures of some dudes busting
[SPEAKER_21]: some serious shit.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the XL Park, so there's always
something fun going on.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's usually a variety of pros in
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: And because the snow's been, you know,
nonexistent this year, we have not much
[SPEAKER_21]: else to go with other than the park.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to go pick up my good buddy
Devin, who of course is the place where we
[SPEAKER_21]: host Hash Church from each Sunday.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got to give a mad shout out to Devin
for a lot, allowing me to roll up at 8.30
[SPEAKER_21]: every morning on Sunday and just do a nice
loud Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_21]: Got a big bag of hash here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go for a little morning toot.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go for some some D420K.
[SPEAKER_21]: Always such a pleasure to smoke my good
buddy's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_21]: Such kindness to share.
[SPEAKER_21]: I really am always shouting those guys
out, obviously, because they're very worth
[SPEAKER_21]: shouting out.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, here we go.
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple more pieces.
[SPEAKER_21]: Stuff's just stuck all over to the top of
this.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Got the mother ship.
[SPEAKER_21]: Fab egg in it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, let's get this wake and bake
going so we can go back down to the valet,
[SPEAKER_21]: get in the car, and go pick up Devin.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's go grab Devin.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Mark.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm Ben.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're Ben.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_21]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad, you know.
[SPEAKER_21]: I had my car brought up and then I ran
away.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Gentlemen here have the keys.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm filming you guys on Bubble Man's
World.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Bubble Man's filming us?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm promoting the West End and how
awesome it is to stay here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope we're the ones who make it awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, dude, you guys, I just told Ben,
literally he's like, well, it's not the
[SPEAKER_21]: nicest hotel.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, yeah, but it's got the best
people working here.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: They haven't picked it up yet,
so they can't find it.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, sorry for the interruption,
guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: But we'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so this is the house of Hash
Church.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going on?
Oh,
[SPEAKER_21]: you were making some vaccines on your
snowboardings?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, just doing a quick wax, buddy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no rush, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just filming a Bubble Man's episode.
[SPEAKER_21]: What up?
[SPEAKER_06]: What up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Bubble World.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is how we do in Whistler,
right?
[SPEAKER_21]: Going to the park.
[SPEAKER_21]: Rocking in the house coat, waxing boards.
[SPEAKER_21]: Rocking in the house coat, waxing boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got my robo.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right home.
[SPEAKER_21]: You look like fucking Dumbledore from a
movie.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's smart, though, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing it into the box like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: That shit gets everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be better if I had a nice station
set up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, ideally.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but you have all this useless shit.
[SPEAKER_21]: You have all this useless shit that needs
to be on this shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking like six batteries for a fucking
room.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no rush.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're good to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be done here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get my gear on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is the Hash Church house.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is where I sit for Hash Church,
right here.
[SPEAKER_21]: First view, I sat over here.
[SPEAKER_21]: But then they got this nasty bong and I
didn't want to sit too close to it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, I have got to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we set up over here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, it's Whistler, so every house
has a view.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know if that's a wedge.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, there's wedge.
[SPEAKER_21]: The top of wedge is over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not quite.
[SPEAKER_21]: Lake is right over here, in behind the
trees.
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, it's ridiculously warm for
Whistler right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's never this warm.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not in February anyway.
[SPEAKER_21]: So most of the snow has melted off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't see really any on the trees.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been going up quite high up the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: The trees are still bare.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're still going to have fun today,
though.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I'm going to grab Devin,
and we're going to head to the West Inn
[SPEAKER_21]: Buffet.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have this killer buffet at the
Aubergine Grill, so why don't you guys
[SPEAKER_21]: join us for that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I supposed to close this door?
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that my position?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the weatherstripping on there is
thick, so you've got to pull it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes the props bag opens.
[SPEAKER_21]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_21]: I got it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a magic button.
[SPEAKER_03]: The West Inn.
[SPEAKER_21]: Should we go right to breakfast?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, now?
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure what we could do with our
boards.
[SPEAKER_21]: Leave them somewhere?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_21]: That hurt.
[SPEAKER_21]: At least I stopped it from... That hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't pleasant.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_21]: Most awkward board carrying.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds like the way we roll.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like the smartest idea ever.
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless you want to go up and have a puff
first.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I do believe I do.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good sushi here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Kaze.
Oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_21]: So Devin had the brilliant idea of coming
up and having a few dabs before we head
[SPEAKER_21]: down to the buffet.
[SPEAKER_21]: So dab it up, brother.
[SPEAKER_21]: Fire in the hole.
[SPEAKER_21]: Fire in the hole, hash in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that mothership.
[SPEAKER_21]: The de-nail rips just keep giving.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're like, oh, you thought you were
done?
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Professional.
[SPEAKER_21]: As you can see, Devin has his hotel
puffing down pat.
[SPEAKER_21]: Simply put, exhale out the window.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, of course, if we do have an inhale
out the...
[SPEAKER_21]: Inside, we've got the fire alarm cover
that every hotel comes with in the
[SPEAKER_21]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_21]: They call it a... What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_21]: They call it... A shower cap.
[SPEAKER_21]: A shower cap, but it's really a cover for
the... To the creative mind.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a smoke protector.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to dab one up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to dab one up, brother.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice well.
[SPEAKER_21]: Some delicious too... Too many different
kinds of delicious hash to even mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Powered through that bitch.
[SPEAKER_21]: Super stoked for buffet.
[SPEAKER_21]: Super stoked for Black Home Park today.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_21]: And B-Rad's birthday to top it off.
[SPEAKER_21]: And B-Rad's birthday to top it off.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, nice record button.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Deb's going in for a second.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you see the mothership man staring you
down?
[SPEAKER_21]: Boom-bastic.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ready for a buffet?
[SPEAKER_21]: Two fingers in the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready to mow down, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, let's go hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Two towers at the Westin, East and West.
[SPEAKER_21]: To the North and South.
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, I'm looking forward to this food.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, I was going to say, isn't it the...
Wasn't it the aubergine grill?
[SPEAKER_21]: Has it been that long since they've been
to the Westin?
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_20]: The grill and vine.
[SPEAKER_20]: Please wait to be seated.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so this... Look at the blue
light.
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at that work the white balance.
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're waiting to be seated.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_17]: They changed it in here quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_21]: Has it really been so long that I've been
here that you are no longer the aubergine
[SPEAKER_21]: grill, but you're now the... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we're excited.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not fast, is it?
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes fast.
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it the breakfast buffet?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like that or do you prefer the
cart?
[SPEAKER_18]: No.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we'll do the buffet.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh,
[SPEAKER_21]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: This looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_21]: Great job, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Salmon.
[SPEAKER_21]: Eggs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bread.
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you feeling about this?
[SPEAKER_21]: Stoked a bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Me too, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: Fruit plate with granola and berries.
[SPEAKER_20]: Beautiful omelet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bon appétit.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was a delicious breakfast.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that was.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: Brunch.
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like I had a couple of breakfasts
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gearing up to go have a quick hot
tub and maybe a steam sauna here at the
[SPEAKER_21]: West End.
[SPEAKER_21]: But before, I've been meaning to do a
couple of reviews on these units.
[SPEAKER_21]: Originally, Jonathan from Wizard Puff sent
me the V5 OS vaporizer from Fly Our Mate,
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess, or it's called the Fly Our Mate.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's from Fly Our Mate vaporizer
technology.
[SPEAKER_21]: And he sent me this a while ago now,
probably close to a month ago.
[SPEAKER_21]: Told him I was going to do a review.
[SPEAKER_21]: Never got around to it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Volcano Sense sent me their mighty another
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the reason I feel OK about doing this
together is because Jonathan sells both of
[SPEAKER_21]: them at WizardPuff.com.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to do a little review on
these.
[SPEAKER_21]: And actually, how we're going to review
them is we're going to take them up the
[SPEAKER_21]: mountain today into the Blackcomb Park,
make sure we have them there with us so we
[SPEAKER_21]: have an ability to medicate.
[SPEAKER_21]: So which one should we try first?
[SPEAKER_21]: Straight to the Fly Our Mate.
[SPEAKER_21]: Fly Our Mate, open her up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Open her up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Got my meditator with a little bit of herb
that I grew back about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_21]: Prepare that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Got to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_21]: Spatula.
[SPEAKER_21]: I see weed.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you just screw it on?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just screws on and pops out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, so this little guy has a ceramic.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a really good little book in here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So give you a little idea on this
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's portable design, fits in the pocket
real easy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Advanced temperature control system
ensures perfect function and purist
[SPEAKER_21]: vaporization, we're going to see.
[SPEAKER_21]: Innovative vapeway with three-way
temperature setting.
[SPEAKER_21]: This I liked.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's got a nice design to hold in your
hand easy.
[SPEAKER_21]: It does feel pretty solid, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, level one, which if you push this
button five times.
[SPEAKER_21]: One, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, blue light turned on.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then inside there, this little blue
light on the outside says that we're at
[SPEAKER_21]: level one, which is 385 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll let it heat up.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll pack it in a second.
[SPEAKER_21]: We can also move it up to 400 degrees
Fahrenheit by clicking it some more times.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure how many it is.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, that's on the next page to level two.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then finally, a red color,
which is 415 degrees.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty cool option for a portable
vaporizer to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Built-in lithium ion battery.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can tell the whole thing is basically
a battery.
[SPEAKER_21]: No plugs to take with you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Huge heating chamber, huge ceramic chamber
helps you get best experience.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, it's got a borosilicate glass
mouthpiece, a little slider on top,
[SPEAKER_21]: cooling holes there with the green button
or the green lights.
[SPEAKER_21]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess here, why don't we med-tain her a
little herb?
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's as simple as just unscrewing
the top and then loading the
chamber.
OK.
[SPEAKER_21]: Always interesting.
[SPEAKER_21]: Vaporizers are always interesting in the
sense that if you get them wrong,
[SPEAKER_21]: if you don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you pack it incorrectly or you do just
the smallest thing wrong, you don't get
[SPEAKER_21]: the rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: So give it a rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll find out what you need to do to
move that into different levels.
[SPEAKER_21]: That looks like it's coming out real nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Milked up the little mouthpiece pretty
nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Showing them.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's quality.
[SPEAKER_21]: Showing them up close.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this will be fun to have the Mighty
and the Flower Mate with us, the V5.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's that tasting on the lips?
[SPEAKER_21]: You getting some nice pulls on that?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to pack a little bit more for
the next unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll try in a bit here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: A little rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we give it a shot?
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was close.
[SPEAKER_21]: Two in a row you blew out?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Three even.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, no, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's doable.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they also sent me a unit along with
this.
[SPEAKER_21]: When you come back, Dev, it's right beside
the computer there, that little metal
[SPEAKER_21]: piece.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought he said it was an herb chamber.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, he said this was another unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess that you could attach on here
somehow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I guess this just comes out maybe.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: That comes off much the way that comes
off.
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have to figure out how to use this
additional piece.
[SPEAKER_21]: Seems pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess you just go like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll figure out what this additional piece
is later on for you guys and make a point
[SPEAKER_21]: on showing that to you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, not a bad little unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty small chamber in the sense,
but if this is an additional chamber,
[SPEAKER_21]: like an XL chamber for larger amounts of
herb, which I think it must be,
[SPEAKER_21]: well then that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to try and hold the button down
for three seconds.
[SPEAKER_21]: Moved into the next color.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of a purple.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that tells me now that I'm going to
move up above 375 degrees or 380 degrees,
[SPEAKER_21]: whatever it was, and get myself into,
yeah, 385.
[SPEAKER_21]: So now we're going to go up to 400.
[SPEAKER_21]: So 15 degree temperature raise.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad at all for the flowermaid.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can push it one, two, three,
four, five more times and it shuts off.
[SPEAKER_21]: It is quite nice and small.
[SPEAKER_21]: This would have been a bummer had it not
been unscrewable because you just snap
[SPEAKER_21]: that thing off in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you can close the unit,
which is also pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can close that unit right up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then on the bottom, the mouthpiece
just goes right back in and closes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not a bad little unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably good for warming the hand to feel
it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, out on the mountain?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that'll heat you up.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Flowermaid, we're going to have that with
us today and we'll let you guys know how
[SPEAKER_21]: many hits we get out of that and how well
the battery operates and et cetera,
[SPEAKER_21]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll figure out this giant herb
chamber as well.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's an added herb chamber.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: So now from stores and Bickel from the
good people who brought you the volcano.
[SPEAKER_21]: Geez, that must be going back to 1999 or
2000.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is called the mighty.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a, I guess their premier portable
unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: I never expect anything but sort of
exceptional quality from volcano.
[SPEAKER_21]: I say what you want about the unit,
but it is quality built.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's got an incredible warranty.
[SPEAKER_21]: And they last a long time.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know people that have had them for well
over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is a nice little design here.
[SPEAKER_21]: The mighty.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's got a nice little design.
[SPEAKER_21]: Got a digital screen.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll peel that plastic off.
[SPEAKER_21]: Comes with as volcano used to sell back in
the day, this little guy here,
[SPEAKER_21]: which is a screen pad.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess you can put that in there and
that way you can use concentrates.
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's the unit itself.
[SPEAKER_21]: When you push the power button on,
it vibrates much like a cell phone.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you've got your bottom
temperature, which is the temperature that
[SPEAKER_21]: it's going to go to.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you have your top temperature,
which is the temperature that it is at
[SPEAKER_21]: right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: And this unit's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's got a cool little mouthpiece right on
the top here.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can twist the entire thing to open it
up, to reveal the chamber.
[SPEAKER_21]: And now if you were going to use
concentrates, you'd put this little fat
[SPEAKER_21]: screen right inside there and then drop
your concentrate foam out.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dry sift whatever on top.
[SPEAKER_21]: The unit obviously has a screen on the top
here as well.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that just screws right back into
place.
[SPEAKER_21]: Super easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Also very handheld and portable.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're going to, Devon and I are going
to load it up right now and let you know
[SPEAKER_21]: how it tastes.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to say the taste on the Flower Mate
was pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ceramic through glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that thing's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not too shabby at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: The size of everyone's like daily iPhone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess some of those new ones are
massive like yours, but yeah, that's like
[SPEAKER_06]: your average one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, that smells nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad it does.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: So here we go into our chamber.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that they made this very wide,
big open chamber so that as you fill the
[SPEAKER_21]: herb, you can, uh, you know, try not to
miss and get herb everywhere.
[SPEAKER_21]: Even though I still generally do.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just give it a little blast out.
[SPEAKER_21]: A little blast out.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've got 195 degrees Celsius,
which is, geez, it must be about 420 or
[SPEAKER_21]: 400 and something degrees.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I'll give this shot at first.
[SPEAKER_21]: They did give us also a grinder,
two little grinders, not really my style.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're kind of plastic grinders.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess probably people would be pretty
stoked still, I guess.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, knowing them it's, I don't even
know what that is actually.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that's a grinder,
dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: High performance vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's like a component or something to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that is tricky.
[SPEAKER_07]: A component.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one looks like a grinder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Filling the ground herbs.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is just trippy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: The other one's a grinder.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have to figure out exactly what this
one is.
[SPEAKER_21]: See, this is what this is.
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember when it was saying filling and
filled with ground herbs?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, so it's the, it's the helper.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what he was using to fill the
units.
[SPEAKER_21]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_21]: How does that go on there?
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a cool thing that I'm just sort of
discovering now.
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks as though they have a way to fit
this on top of here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so your ground herbs just naturally go
right into the chamber without you having
[SPEAKER_21]: to do what I just did like an idiot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, we'll check that out in a bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to hit this for now because it's
heating up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something different for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a nice tasting rib.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_21]: The unit had just turned off, but I still
got my hit.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess it's got battery saver.
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe you got two large lithium ion
batteries in either side and then just the
[SPEAKER_21]: middle is the actual vapor vaporizer unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you have the screen.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty cool little unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: The screen or the opening, the,
the, the, the straw is quite big.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not like restricted at all.
[SPEAKER_21]: You really get a full flow of vapor.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_21]: That last rip I took, I was hauling on it,
kind of breaking my intuitive knowledge of
[SPEAKER_21]: vaporizers and that if you suck too hard,
you create cold air that cools the unit
[SPEAKER_21]: and gives you less of a hit.
[SPEAKER_21]: That just did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was pulling on it quite hard for my
whole head.
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't doing the slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just doing the vacuum and that was a
really exceptional vapor rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously these units are in different
price ranges.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure exactly the price range.
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, I didn't do that research.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think this one for some reason might be
around the $300 area and this one might be
[SPEAKER_21]: around the $100 to $150, maybe $200.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're both quality units in that sense,
but so far for rip for rip, this thing has
[SPEAKER_21]: given me the most insane rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: The mightiest speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's quite something.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we'll bring both of these up on the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we'll bring them out to the hot
tub right now and let you know how they do
[SPEAKER_21]: around a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if one gets wet, see if it gets
destroyed or see if they're ... You know,
[SPEAKER_21]: we'll just test them out as we do.
[SPEAKER_21]: Straight to the test.
[SPEAKER_21]: See if they're waterproof.
[SPEAKER_21]: See if they're waterproof, exactly.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's all sorts of things I don't even
know about this unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: This thing I just found.
[SPEAKER_21]: A little cleaner.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right up the bottom.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, there you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: For cleaning out the ... Wow.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't believe this thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: The mighty is a good one.
[SPEAKER_19]: The mighty is mighty.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't go wrong with the mighty.
[SPEAKER_19]: Should we hit that hot tub?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot tubbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a fever of 103.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot tubbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cooked.
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, are we going to come up here and
have a buffet?
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the CCPPA annual meaning?
[SPEAKER_20]: Hope we're not late.
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's the mighty.
[SPEAKER_21]: Look how it just fits into the surrounding
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not standing out at all, but just really a
real nice little unit.
[SPEAKER_20]: Flower man's no slouch either.
[SPEAKER_20]: Exceptional little unit.
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice and small.
[SPEAKER_20]: In the hand, not worried.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, put that key in the ...
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Open sesame.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, open sesame.
Nice
[SPEAKER_21]: and empty in here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is ideal when you're walking into a
bathroom with your camera on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are those two doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn that thing off, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we're going to have our
first bubble session.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just joking.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, steam room is equipped with the
steam.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's push that button and get that
steamer on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's turn the light on.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess they're working on one of the
showers.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty sweet rooftop showers, too,
though.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, they got these new lockers.
[SPEAKER_21]: You just push the code in and you can get
a free locker.
[SPEAKER_21]: Eucalyptus steam.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we'll come out, take you out to the
hot tub and have a session.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, that was an exceptional steam
eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's head out to the pool and hot tub
area.
[SPEAKER_20]: The Westin ... Let me change the light for
you guys here.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's no good.
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_21]: They also have a really nice sauna room.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not huge, just a tiny little guy,
but it's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Get your dry heat on.
[SPEAKER_21]: A nice indoor hot tub next to a nice
seating area.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then they have an outdoor pool,
an indoor pool that goes to the outdoor
[SPEAKER_21]: pool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then a nice little hot tub over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: What I was thinking ...
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that I would hang my ... Actually,
I'll put it over by the hot tub.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: This pool is about as warm as a hot tub
right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think it'll go so deep that I
can't walk all the way over.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your lifestyle right here,
guys?
[SPEAKER_21]: Dabbing it up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we're going to end up using
those vaporizers that we have over here
[SPEAKER_21]: sitting by the hot tub.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, that's warm.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got the mighty vaporizer turned on
here, 45 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're just in time for a mighty session,
bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: I got the mighty all packed up and ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like how this thing gives you a nice big
full battery read.
[SPEAKER_21]: Six battery bars on that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure if you guys can see that,
but there's six of them.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're at 100 degrees Celsius already,
and I can start to smell the herb in the
[SPEAKER_21]: eunuch.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a good idea to go song
bubbles while we film our sesh.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, you should show everyone your crazy
fucking Whistler collarbone.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I'm right on camera.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: That is some fucked up.
[SPEAKER_21]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_21]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, if you come shred hard enough,
you too can have a collarbone like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: You got to earn it.
[SPEAKER_21]: 160 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not something you really want to
earn.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not something you want to earn.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, how sweet is this?
[SPEAKER_21]: So nice that they closed the whole place
for us to film Bubbleman's world.
[SPEAKER_21]: Shout out to the Westin for shutting down
the pool area and the hot tub area so that
[SPEAKER_21]: we could film our little episode and tell
you how awesome they are here at the
[SPEAKER_21]: Westin.
[SPEAKER_21]: From all the people, the staff that work
here through the kitchen and the hotel,
[SPEAKER_21]: the valets, they're all really super good
people.
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of them shred the mountain and I see
them outside of work.
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, shout out to all you guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: We have reached temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you hear it vibrate?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop ready to go.
[SPEAKER_21]: This thing gives incredible rips.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sprout looking good off in the distance.
[SPEAKER_21]: Jeez, I guess you could easily have a
rubber sort of piece on the outside of
[SPEAKER_21]: this thing, like a membrane.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you could easily hold it with a wet
hand.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you could potentially even hold
it with a wet hand, although there is an
[SPEAKER_21]: opening right here to the power unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: So keep it out of water, folks.
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't claim waterproof.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's just darn good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tasty, too.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the Astro Boy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, even old herb.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's over a year old and it still just
has that wicked taste, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice little high from it, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just gazing at it for a second.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know.
[SPEAKER_21]: You keep looking behind me like there's
someone there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, there was a dude standing there,
but it was all good.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to blow it out.
[SPEAKER_21]: I would have.
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the beautiful things about having a
federal license here in Canada is as long
[SPEAKER_21]: as you're not obviously breaking anyone's
personal rules, business rules,
[SPEAKER_21]: or offending people with children and
such, that it seems to be a pretty safe
[SPEAKER_21]: bet that doing a small amount of
vaporizing in an area that's not affecting
[SPEAKER_21]: anyone and not affecting even the place,
I think it's a good thing to allow people
[SPEAKER_21]: to do such things rather than make them
feel like they have to go hide to simply
[SPEAKER_21]: medicate.
[SPEAKER_21]: Particularly for some people, it really
just requires a quick one or two rips
[SPEAKER_21]: before they can sort of self-regulate
themselves back from either an anxiety
[SPEAKER_21]: attack or a potential seizure,
tremors with people from that area.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that cool wind is nice,
isn't it?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: Shutting down the mighty.
[SPEAKER_21]: Going to go put that one away.
[SPEAKER_21]: Talking to my wife.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we do have the flower mate.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess we might as well just get her
done, son.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice steam right into a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like this, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_21]: That little cubby hole to keep it put away
in, and I'm impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so that closes back up.
[SPEAKER_21]: This simply opens up.
[SPEAKER_21]: All the herbs still in there nicely.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still always one to give it a little
blow by blow, so we'll go one,
[SPEAKER_21]: two, three, four, five, and get our blue
temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: It takes a few seconds to heat up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, this one's a little more simple in
the sense that it doesn't show us any
[SPEAKER_21]: temperatures We know that there are three
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_21]: The blue, the pink, and then finally the
purple, and then finally red are the three
[SPEAKER_21]: options.
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought the second one was supposed to
be orange, but I could be mistaken now
[SPEAKER_21]: that I'm all vaped up at the hot tub here
in the Westin.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that cool wind is feeling proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_21]: That taste is exceptional.
[SPEAKER_21]: You really can taste a difference in the
ceramic to the borosilicate as opposed to
[SPEAKER_21]: the, I guess, I guess it must be ceramic.
[SPEAKER_21]: into more of a plastic composite that the
vaporizer guys are using.
[SPEAKER_21]: They also have a bigger straw,
and I feel like I get a bigger rip,
[SPEAKER_21]: but I'll tell you, vaping the same herb,
there is almost a sweeter taste than the
[SPEAKER_21]: first.
[SPEAKER_21]: You took the first few rips the last time,
so I didn't get that sweet taste,
[SPEAKER_21]: but this time I got it.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, let's hold this for three
seconds.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll turn that to the next color.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep, there we go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, it beeped like a cell phone as well.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess they're all doing it.
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, you can see the little flashers
got a little sort of pink side to it as
[SPEAKER_21]: well, and we could even go three more
seconds, and then she goes red.
[SPEAKER_21]: And now red is a 450 degree temperature
that it's gonna go up to.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see if we can taste the difference
in that rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just beeped again, I'm guessing that means
it got up to temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this unit is quite fast in regards to
how fast it gets up to temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice and portable.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure that it would survive a drop
in the hot tub, nor would the other unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you're going to be jumping in the
hot tub this winter and using these units,
[SPEAKER_21]: please be careful and don't expect them to
cover any warranty damage if you get water
[SPEAKER_21]: into them.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why we don't have the bubbles on
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So, so far so good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty impressed with both the Flower Mate
and the Mighty.
[SPEAKER_21]: Love the taste on both of them,
love the portability, and it'll be
[SPEAKER_21]: interesting to see how long the batteries
last once we have the session that we had,
[SPEAKER_21]: the session that we're having,
we're probably gonna have another one in
[SPEAKER_21]: the gondola, and then eventually we'll get
up to the bike, or the bike park,
[SPEAKER_21]: the park, and we'll see if the batteries
are still going and allowing us to take
[SPEAKER_21]: rips up there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Larging and charging.
[SPEAKER_21]: Larging and charging.
[SPEAKER_21]: See you guys on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, so we're finally heading out for
the day.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is pretty much just beautiful
weather, hey?
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking forward to some park laps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they sure did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks completely different.
[SPEAKER_21]: At least on the outside, I wonder if they
did any interior
work.
[SPEAKER_17]: You heading up Blackcomb?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: No?
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I got everything.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I wouldn't say no to help.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, this old rickety tin can,
hey?
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Holy smokes compared to the new Whistler
one.
[SPEAKER_21]: Little change of pace.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the old rickety cans.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is very different.
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_20]: Put my tripod through the window.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it's official.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's hot as fuck.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the Whistler gondola over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Big glass roof.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the mountain coming down.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're heading up Blackcomb.
[SPEAKER_21]: So the Blackcomb gondola does not make it
all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to take us to Excalibur?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Excalibur.
[SPEAKER_21]: Which will be nice because we'll be out of
this hot box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excalibur, the accelerator I think it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the gondola is called Excalibur.
Right.
[SPEAKER_21]: The top is accelerator.
[SPEAKER_21]: Speaking of hot box, we could pull the
mothership out and do a dab.
[SPEAKER_21]: Or just use the vape pens.
[SPEAKER_21]: Or just use the vape pens.
[SPEAKER_21]: God, we've got opportunities here.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the gondola.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: So there goes Whistler Village.
[SPEAKER_21]: Bye bye, Whistler Village.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cougar Mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a mountain biker.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still February.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: 24th of that matter.
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, whatever.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going up right now without gloves and
a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank my boys at Trichome Heavy
Extracts for the hoodie today.
[SPEAKER_21]: That will be keeping me warm up on the top
of Blackcomb Mountain while we're enjoying
[SPEAKER_21]: a little park session.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we're coming into
mid-station here.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess we're getting off,
huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're staying on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, we're staying on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, we go up to Excalibur.
[SPEAKER_21]: What is this called?
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Excalibur.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_21]: So what does it go up to?
[SPEAKER_21]: Accelerator.
[SPEAKER_21]: Accelerator.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, for this time of year to be this
high up the mountain, there's the ski pool
[SPEAKER_21]: jumps for the summer.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the wizard chair.
[SPEAKER_21]: Over there are all the streets like
Spearhead Drive and Painted Cliffs.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's some nice condos that you can rent
over there if you want an on-mountain
[SPEAKER_21]: experience.
[SPEAKER_21]: This doesn't look very good, though.
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at this, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: How barely it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like it's the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_21]: It does look like the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the end of February.
[SPEAKER_21]: I sure hope it's not.
[SPEAKER_21]: It is one of the cooler things to look at
all of this and just think this is what we
[SPEAKER_21]: ride down.
[SPEAKER_21]: We ride down here.
[SPEAKER_21]: We go through these trees.
[SPEAKER_21]: We go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's boulders and big gnarly features,
fallen trees and such.
[SPEAKER_21]: And the snow just covers them all up.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't imagine coming down these cliffs
on our boards without that snow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally getting into the snow line up
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: This seems like naturally a snow line that
they didn't have to push down.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_21]: God, would this mountain be fun on a dirt
bike.
[SPEAKER_21]: Imagine in the summer if they just did it
for one week.
[SPEAKER_21]: They invited everyone with dirt bikes and
they set up monster courses and they just
[SPEAKER_21]: did a huge dirt bike event.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_21]: I would so support that event in any way,
shape or form that I could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's give them the view.
[SPEAKER_21]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_21]: What is that, Alta Lake?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, that's Alta.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's the Whistler Village.
[SPEAKER_21]: Say goodbye bye as we head up,
up, up and away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet, sweet.
[SPEAKER_21]: The crew.
[SPEAKER_21]: Huge lines up at Accelerator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to be there for hours,
bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy Christ, is it warm.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I should thank Nico right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nico.
[SPEAKER_21]: Shout out to Nico here on the top of Black
Hole Mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not quite the top of Black Hole
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe about a third of the way up or half
way up.
[SPEAKER_21]: But Nico had this board made and given to
me at the Salomon Factory in France.
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the last boards to be pressed
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you check it out, he actually got
my name on there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Etched in.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's on the inside.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I can't remember what it was called.
[SPEAKER_21]: A G-stick or something.
[SPEAKER_21]: But absolutely beautiful board.
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember KLM charged me an arm and a leg
to bring it home as extra baggage.
[SPEAKER_21]: But man, what a nice gift, Nico.
[SPEAKER_21]: So thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope you enjoy this video.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're thinking about you here in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, Monsieur Devon.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just in time to answer it.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's Whistler looking majestic over on
the other side.
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn majestic.
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, well let's head over.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, nice tune job on the board.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel
[SPEAKER_16]: like I barely fit through that thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going, dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a rough life up here having right
now.
[SPEAKER_21]: Here, why don't you hold this.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll get a paper riser ready for us.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, why not, right?
[SPEAKER_21]: The gondola just felt a little off.
[SPEAKER_21]: A little forced.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll go this style.
[SPEAKER_20]: Reach down, see what we find first.
[SPEAKER_20]: See if there's a big speaker.
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a shit ton of dry sip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, I really have this bag packed pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_20]: A little deeper.
[SPEAKER_21]: A little deeper.
[SPEAKER_21]: We find the Mighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mighty, how you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's turn the Mighty on right
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_21]: See what we got in the med-tainer.
[SPEAKER_21]: Shout out to John.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice and clean in the chamber.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty easy going in the sense of how
cleaning it and then reloading it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Even the wind is a little bit windy up
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not completely windless.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's up here and it's still pretty easy to
load up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not feeling overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_21]: The one finger clean.
[SPEAKER_21]: Make sure the outside is all nice and
clean before you screw the top on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Put this away so we don't lose it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've got a hundred and thirty-three
degrees so far, if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not sure, but... Yep, we're good.
[SPEAKER_21]: About another minute of enjoying this
view.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to have a nice little
session with the Mighty here on the
[SPEAKER_21]: gondola.
[SPEAKER_21]: Or this chair lift, sorry.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to say how easy it was to find in
my bag, unload and reload, turn it on,
[SPEAKER_21]: get it up to temperature and then here
soon to take a rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm pretty impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_21]: It also feels like a durable unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like if I dropped it, maybe on a day like
today where it's hard pack, it would
[SPEAKER_21]: probably break.
[SPEAKER_21]: But on a regular day with snow,
it's just normal, nice and soft snow.
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't feel like dropping this would
be saying goodbye to it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It feels like you could come back down and
get it and it could potentially still be
[SPEAKER_21]: on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's have a rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a solid sized rip.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm impressed because it's a cold wind out
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: The chamber really has to be sealed well
and containing its own heat well because
[SPEAKER_21]: it's a nice cold wind in my face right
now.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brother man?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty good easy use for a chair lift
unit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Great taste on it too.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can start to feel the temperature
difference up here now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't by any means say that it's
cold, but you can definitely feel the
[SPEAKER_21]: coolness in the air from all the snow
that's present now.
[SPEAKER_21]: That and the fact that the chair lift
seems to be rocking at a good clip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad on the mighty, hey?
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Near the end of that hit.
[SPEAKER_21]: Give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_21]: You might be surprised.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how do we turn up the temperature?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, just.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just with the, this one is really easy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like the up button.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Get it up to 200 if you like.
[SPEAKER_21]: Chair lift rips.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, maybe we could get them to stop the
chair lift so we could just enjoy
[SPEAKER_21]: ourselves for a few minutes without the
wind.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, would you look at that?
[SPEAKER_21]: We stopped.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good fun up here on Whistler Mount.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't wait to get you guys into the park
and show you what some of these,
[SPEAKER_21]: what some of these guys are capable of
doing off of some of the features in
[SPEAKER_21]: there.
[SPEAKER_21]: You've been having quite a bit of fun in
there in the last couple of weeks?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's been good in there for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since the sun came out, but it's still
been bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still nice, so it's good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess from 12 or 1 till 3, it softens up
a little bit in the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's soft spots and there's still their
icy patches.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the shade, it's still solid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still cold up here at night.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice, you just got to temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard it go zzzz.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like a text coming in.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're already designed to react to that
very sound of that particular vibration of
[SPEAKER_21]: what many iPhones sound like when they are
vibrating.
[SPEAKER_21]: What a freaking beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we're getting near the top here,
a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_21]: And where do we head from here?
[SPEAKER_21]: Down to?
[SPEAKER_21]: Down to Jersey and then up to the top of
Katz Skinner, is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jersey and then we'll be at the top of
Katz Skinner in Solar yet?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just in this top shelf here?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, just fold the little piece in and
get it in there and then if you can just
[SPEAKER_21]: get this and manage to close it all
around, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like just giving a real honest review,
having it with us, pulling it out
[SPEAKER_21]: throughout the day, using it and letting
people know what they... We've got a few
[SPEAKER_21]: other people that have never tried it
before to hit it as well and see what they
[SPEAKER_21]: think.
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll be of course before the mothership
gets pulled out because you know I got my
[SPEAKER_21]: mothership in here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell yeah, I brought the mothership on the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_21]: People are like, why do you bring your
mothership with you?
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, so I have it with me.
[SPEAKER_21]: Doesn't that make good sense?
[SPEAKER_21]: I had my bag grabbed the other day on the
peak chair.
[SPEAKER_21]: I had my helmet and my goggles hanging off
of it.
[SPEAKER_21]: My goggles kind of went down and snagged.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was pulling for a bit but I managed
to get them off before it fell.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just got so much shit, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, G.
[SPEAKER_20]: Heading up a little higher.
You think I
[SPEAKER_20]: managed?
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so this will be that one cold
chair where you kind of feel it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest will be in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice when the sun's on you.
[SPEAKER_21]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunshine, sunshine breaking.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're getting into a little bit more of
the gnarly part of Black Home.
[SPEAKER_21]: Getting up, up, up, up on the left there
is Black Home Glacier up in behind there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't see it but it's there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Super stoked.
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so the last little section here.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're heading over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: On the other side of that ridge is where
the Black Home Park is.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then over here is where the Black Home
Glacier is.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a pretty gnarly cornice up there.
[SPEAKER_21]: The whole mountain top is a cornice.
[SPEAKER_21]: God, it's not many people on the mountain,
eh?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's surreal, actually.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wouldn't want to be dropping those cliffs
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even on the pow days I don't care to
really drop those.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've done those on a pow day, it's kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I've done them but... They're just not
your style.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, they're steeper.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I guess I should tag in.
[SPEAKER_21]: Eh?
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm doing everything but tagging,
like tying my... Never mind, I'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright then, there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got this lens but... I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you want to just take this bag?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when we get there?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'll take it right now, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck, dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got that in the towel, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well I'll try to just, you know...
At least have the towels in there so it's
[SPEAKER_08]: like secure.
[SPEAKER_20]: Keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it's in there, just your lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: Gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't even recognize you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you knock out your teeth or you got a
mouth guard in?
[SPEAKER_21]: Good, good job.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good job, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, well this should be fun.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you
[SPEAKER_17]: going to hit, the jump on the right?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll probably go sit on the knuckle there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably be the better spot.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry about me, I'm not going to hit
you.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll follow you down.
A
[SPEAKER_20]: day in the park.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Black Hole Park.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_21]: The Edger Casey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice run, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not a bad first lap.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, with a huge board, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what's getting me.
[SPEAKER_21]: What is that, like a 168 or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is the 5'2".
[SPEAKER_03]: The 5'2 that they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: The smallest surprise they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, why does it look so huge?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the shape?
[SPEAKER_03]: The nose is just big on it, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm sure liking the Salomon.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Should be fun, but then again I'm not...
I'm just trying to keep it together with
[SPEAKER_21]: all this equipment in my hands.
[SPEAKER_21]: Two backpacks and two cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice road.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a nice, fun day.
[SPEAKER_11]: The jumps are fast right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a solid landing, but fast.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, back there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was pretty serious rotations he was
doing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ran away.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice to see just a full lineup of people
hitting it, eh?
[SPEAKER_21]: Non-stop.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we got the skier.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good old Whistler.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of talented riders.
[SPEAKER_20]: Endless amounts, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slays it in all the arts.
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the one where we're going to get
the baller angle.
[SPEAKER_21]: He was who the cameraman was waiting for.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can tell it is jumping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty big jump right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say 20 feet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Buddy was doubled.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 feet, that's big on 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 40?
[SPEAKER_02]: The table top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_21]: Super steep landing, too.
[SPEAKER_21]: People are just standing there waiting for
someone to hit it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Buddy's been double backflipping in the
last few days.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been tons of people on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably this group.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'd love to get some footage of
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Mary Fons and then they all got
their Red Bull helmets and all that jazz
[SPEAKER_10]: on.
Representing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're hardcore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good day for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome park, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: He's not hitting it, is he?
[SPEAKER_20]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, is that what happened?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why everything's held up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the dangers of the Whistler
Snowboard Park here, guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope he's doing okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope he gets better.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hate to see that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Young kids all crumpled out on the bottom
of a big jump like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's definitely no games up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: You come into this section of the park and
you better know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_21]: And even those that do know what they're
doing, sometimes you can get rocked.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good to see.
[SPEAKER_21]: He was knocked out for a while there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_21]: Outdoor sports are very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't stop us from doing them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Huck it in the puck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just going sand in the park on
some days like this that are solid.
[SPEAKER_21]: Man, how did this dude get crushed here?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a flat area.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a solid day over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: It is a solid day.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe he came up the lift.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to try and put that backpack on
the back of my backpack.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to hook it up a different way.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'm thinking,
[SPEAKER_16]: you want to do another full run or do you
want to go sit on that knuckle and get
[SPEAKER_16]: some shots?
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't mind getting a little bit of
footy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully I got that on video and camera.
[SPEAKER_17]: You lead the way because you can get us to
a good spot, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Even over by the snow gun.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is probably as good a spot as any.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_20]: those are heavy bags.
[SPEAKER_20]: Not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll say the one thing that's a bummer is
I did forget my water.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe someone will pull up with water.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you need to, we could do a lap
and then
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess we could, hey?
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just finish the, we'll do a cozy run
and then come back to another run.
[SPEAKER_21]: Never like to see it, but at least he's on
his way to get help.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like motorcycle gangs or something.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, the shredders.
[SPEAKER_21]: The different groups.
[SPEAKER_21]: They just come in hot.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, oh, those guys aren't fucking
around, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the Whistler Park crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: No joke.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've always had fun coming in here and
getting pictures.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's some exceptional riders that come
in here and if you set up your shot
[SPEAKER_21]: properly and you get the right mountains
in the background, ooh, man, you get some
[SPEAKER_21]: pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a spot right here that I'd,
right here is where I'd like to sit,
[SPEAKER_21]: right near that chair and snap some good
shots of my 200.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we have stopped.
[SPEAKER_21]: Due to our forgetfulness of not bringing
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: What?
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they serious about this?
[SPEAKER_21]: What's it going, Ted?
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_21]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Out playing picture.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we're doing video pictures.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's gonna grab some food, but I guess
they're closed.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty much, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: That hurts.
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll get a little cheese and crackers.
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't say no to a little cheese and
crackers.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sitting over by the window.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well, we're coming to join you.
[SPEAKER_21]: With our waters.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hang out with Timbo.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm surprised you're not outside.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?
[SPEAKER_21]: I said I'm surprised you're not outside.
[SPEAKER_21]: Talk about crazy timing.
[SPEAKER_18]: How've you been?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, real good.
[SPEAKER_18]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen those things there.
Very good.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're doing a lot of stuff, a lot of
traveling.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I go to Jamaica a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Gotta go there, actually, next week.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's that for a nice little dessert in
between?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just like epic right there.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, a good bump in India, Tim.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I do not see any in sight.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, well, we can go down and do the denial
session quick.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe quickly go down to that big kong
even and get a video or a few pictures
[SPEAKER_21]: before the denial session.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big kong?
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not the big kong, but the second,
the big jump.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the jump, right.
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're usually over in those trees
over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Guess who are those trees over there?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's funny, because we rolled up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw them floating.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're flying.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess they're going to catch the last
little opening bit of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go hit the park.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait,
[SPEAKER_09]: should we get the mother going?
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we should get the mother going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_21]: I got the dabber.
[SPEAKER_21]: I got more shit up here than I know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I might be the only person ever to
have brought a mother ship.
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly, up on a ski hill.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, my.
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_18]: Being knee down, Scotty.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm as high as I can get.
[SPEAKER_18]: At 6,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not rookies.
[SPEAKER_21]: We were rookies.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't have the water initially.
[SPEAKER_21]: We went up to the rendezvous, where we
bumped into Tim, thanks to the cheese and
[SPEAKER_21]: crackers.
[SPEAKER_21]: So obviously, we can't have the D-nail up
here.
[SPEAKER_21]: The hard part about this always is warming
the hash up to the point where it softens
[SPEAKER_21]: up, so you can kind of get a little dab
maybe.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's dry sift, too.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just mechanical separations via screens.
[SPEAKER_21]: Bouncing resin on the screens.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then of course, some more techniques
in regards to further refining and
[SPEAKER_21]: cleaning and decontaminating.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty stoked about this, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the proper way to transfer a
mothership.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got helicopters.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got motherships.
[SPEAKER_21]: We got one person after another behind us
hitting these different features.
[SPEAKER_21]: I always find the torch is a little bit
difficult to deal with.
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you can't really see what it's
doing.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'll operate it by the sound.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we get that quartz heated up nice and
hot.
[SPEAKER_21]: We get a great grip.
[SPEAKER_21]: Or a dab, as the kids are calling it these
days, Tim.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_18]: A dab.
[SPEAKER_18]: A little dab will do you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this is what they say.
[SPEAKER_18]: A little brilliant teen commercial.
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's like some 50s and 60s shit right
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe before that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to say maybe even 40s,
eh?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Brillo or Brillex or Brillo?
[SPEAKER_18]: Brilliant teen.
[SPEAKER_18]: Brilliant teen.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well, I'm going to give this a
shot.
[SPEAKER_21]: Go for a dab of roosting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big fine job.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine job.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa, Wally G.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: A little flake.
[SPEAKER_21]: Such a sweet place to spend your days.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so epic.
[SPEAKER_21]: Truly, people throw that word around like
it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, my new stereo system's epic.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_21]: Your new stereo system's not epic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was not amazing.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: It can be cool.
[SPEAKER_21]: But epic.
[SPEAKER_21]: It could be that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's leave epic for such things as
mountains as far as the eyes can see.
[SPEAKER_21]: A slice of humble pie is so big,
it'll kill you in an instant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wally flew in the whole day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll torch you up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Even if you want to, after this dab,
go and rip down and get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if we got enough time, I'll stop him
to do that quarter pipe again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, get that shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get right on top of it and poke him for
the shot.
[SPEAKER_21]: Take it as much as fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_21]: Quick, quick.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not even sure how hot we got it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, he's getting hit.
[SPEAKER_21]: God, you've got to love the torches.
[SPEAKER_21]: My torch just died.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was scary.
[SPEAKER_18]: Torch died.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trouble in Whoville tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the electric down at the car.
[SPEAKER_20]: The electric nail.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't worry too much about it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
It's too bad.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, do you still have that charger
cable?
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't used that little mini hitter.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to bring it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a USB one, right?
[SPEAKER_21]: So the one that screws up.
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a trippy stick?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I know exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, boys, it's holiday for the drums.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was sporting my Hitman hat today under
the old goggles.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I wasn't jumping.
[SPEAKER_21]: Devin was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Airborne.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good to have the bucket when you're
airborne.
[SPEAKER_21]: Freestyle terrain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Free ride.
[SPEAKER_21]: Session smart and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think we session pretty smart up
here, wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the mothership.
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you can see, feeding your
endocannabinoid system shouldn't just be
[SPEAKER_21]: looked at as the negative stereotype of,
like, oh, they're getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called feeding your endocannabinoid
system, tuning in.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's helpful with meditation.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's helpful, obviously, with a guy like
Devin, who wouldn't put himself in any
[SPEAKER_21]: unnecessary danger.
[SPEAKER_21]: He still feels that he's safe to have a
rip or two and go and do some of these
[SPEAKER_21]: jumps.
[SPEAKER_21]: Feel that it helps you a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, with a collarbone like mine,
it definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just to...
[SPEAKER_21]: Give a little bit more on the flexibility,
too, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're looking at the north face of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to be going down that
face.
[SPEAKER_05]: The south face will be lit up,
actually.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so, too, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm easy.
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the idea of taking them across the
peak to peak and showing them a little bit
[SPEAKER_21]: of that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I got it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a beast.
[SPEAKER_17]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm stoked we caught this.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: This has to be one of the last cabins,
eh?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I got five more minutes,
too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Four-fifteen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peak to peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big peak to peak.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just missed the sightseeing one with the
glass bottom, but I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've been in it enough times.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know what the height's all about.
[SPEAKER_17]: Looks like we're going to have our own
cabin.
[SPEAKER_17]: How fun is that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's this for fun?
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think this is going to be pretty
freaking awesome, Devon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_21]: Just the two of us.
[SPEAKER_21]: And our Debs.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tight.
[SPEAKER_16]: You feel the power of that first little
dip.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I say we pull out the vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_21]: Da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, didn't get to rip with Tim.
[SPEAKER_21]: Not that bad.
[SPEAKER_21]: I really feel the motion of that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never felt that so strong before.
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Peak to peak gondola, dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: Longest one in the world.
[SPEAKER_21]: 50 million bucks.
[SPEAKER_21]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_21]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: Open some windows in here.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so hot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Super.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to feel yours?
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure will.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sort it out.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so warm in here.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to open the back.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got to open these back windows.
[SPEAKER_20]: Got a little bit of a...
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just drop it into this one,
huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_08]: Drop it in.
[SPEAKER_21]: Close this guy out.
[SPEAKER_21]: Down we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: So beautiful out there.
[SPEAKER_21]: You could have a nap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to
[SPEAKER_21]: 165.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to start giving her.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you've got about 11 minutes on this
gondola from one side to the other.
[SPEAKER_21]: Taking us from the top of Blackholm over
to the not quite top of Blackholm.
[SPEAKER_21]: Top of Whistler, but damn near close.
[SPEAKER_21]: Top of the gondola, roundhouse.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting right above the river down
below, which is where Shane McConkey,
[SPEAKER_21]: when this first opened, I believe he did
like a backflip, pace jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and Eric Rohner, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric Rohner was here, too, for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they both jumped off it.
[SPEAKER_21]: They both jumped off it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very cool.
Maniacs.
[SPEAKER_21]: RIP, Shane McConkey.
[SPEAKER_21]: Legends.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yup, every day goes by on this mountain
and many other mountains where people
[SPEAKER_21]: aren't thinking of those guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: The mighty's
[SPEAKER_07]: just delivering great rips.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's about to say.
[SPEAKER_21]: Although I think that one might have it on
flavor.
[SPEAKER_21]: That one's almost a connoisseur model,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we're definitely hitting tasty vibe,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the turn up?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you turn this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: You hold it up for three seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you hold it for three seconds.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and then it'll turn, it'll glow
together, there you go.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you'll see two colors glowing in
it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Purple on one side and blue on the other.
[SPEAKER_21]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you hold it for three more
seconds to get it up to 415, which it will
[SPEAKER_21]: go all red.
[SPEAKER_21]: Might even just go up to temperature.
[SPEAKER_21]: I felt it vibrate.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Man, that sun is be right.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't even really enjoy the view that way.
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost have to look back.
[SPEAKER_21]: If I look over there, I mean, that's
really the most epic right there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Flame full all the way through.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it's been a good Bubble Man's World
episode today.
[SPEAKER_21]: Riding at Whistler, hanging out with
Devin, showing you guys a little bit of
[SPEAKER_21]: the locals' life.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty good living up here,
even when the snow is sparse, which I
[SPEAKER_21]: can't believe it right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just kind of came to grips with the
view.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I just kind of realized, oh my god,
there's snow snow.
[SPEAKER_21]: Except over there, there's plenty.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to show them those mountains.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to
[SPEAKER_21]: go into the back country and head over
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the back of the Singing Pass.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess back here you have Oboe and Cowboy
Ridge.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on Whistler's side.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over to the right, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's all on Whistler's side.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so this all just must tie into it?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like Decker and all that to the
left coming from Blackcomb.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_20]: People have been doing that for a while,
haven't they?
[SPEAKER_20]: Going into that back country zone.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's the vapes, man?
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's a really nice feature right
there, where it's kind of vape on demand
[SPEAKER_21]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, mine did just turn off now.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's still giving pretty nice rips.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_20]: Could be out on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_21]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Up in Tri-Comb Heavy Extracts,
up on Whistler.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's hot.
[SPEAKER_21]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_21]: I had to touch the base of the glass.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's all part of the line.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I like the fact that it's got a case
in it, so you can unscrew it from the top
[SPEAKER_21]: and still put it away inside.
[SPEAKER_21]: And even if it's hot, I'm sure that it
doesn't really help.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not too much of a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: The top's still on itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to unscrew it from the top.
[SPEAKER_20]: Check that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Check that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Check that in.
[SPEAKER_20]: Check that.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a bad look, either.
[SPEAKER_20]: I go to it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, it doesn't seem to work on the
app.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just tripping.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll carry the tripod under that
camera.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Patty and all that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you want to go say hi?
[SPEAKER_09]: Might as well stop by and say hi.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just going to grab them.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll spend the next 20 minutes trying
to kick Patty out.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, boys?
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_21]: Good.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm filming it.
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: Getting some cool shots right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Bubble Man's world.
[SPEAKER_21]: So these are Whistler locals.
[SPEAKER_21]: They hang out and they drink beer and
sometimes smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_21]: Often using terms like shred and nar,
sometimes in the same sentence,
[SPEAKER_21]: like shred the nar.
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, dude, we missed that.
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't get it on camera.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, he fell off the chair.
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you require first aid?
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you require first aid?
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you get mental aid?
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, on a scale of 1 to 10, how drunk is
Ryan right now?
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to say 7.2.
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, a solid 7.2.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, are we too early for groomers?
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we going to get some groomers?
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, pulling the birthday card over there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, isn't it your birthday, Patty?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, next Monday.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, shit, it really is.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_18]: Daily, though, daily.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the time of day when the
drunkards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know who ain't got the money.
[SPEAKER_21]: Whoa, hey.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, now, hold there.
[SPEAKER_21]: A week?
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on, 12 grand a week, a month?
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know what he gets with it.
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be some EI I'd be signing up for.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, maybe him and Devin could buy.
[SPEAKER_19]: 12 Gs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're really not making it fast,
are you?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's open up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: End of the day open.
[SPEAKER_21]: No, don't worry about it, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: One's just going down, one just came up.
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess we could go hit some groomers if
you guys want to get some freshies.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think we'll be able to do the
7th day.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we'll be able to fly in the 6th,
day the 6th and the 7th, and then we'd
[SPEAKER_21]: have to leave the 8th because we,
well, we fly out, we fly out at 44.
[SPEAKER_21]: Listen, it would be pretty cool,
dude.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never been to the cup.
[SPEAKER_21]: To see you in the grill at the cup that
I'm speaking at and judging.
[SPEAKER_18]: Will you be judging on that day or the
last day?
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, but we'll hang out.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, fuck, sure we will.
[SPEAKER_21]: Regardless.
[SPEAKER_21]: I will get eyed to the pie.
[SPEAKER_21]: Pie fucking eyed.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fresh groomers.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: What?
Dude,
[SPEAKER_17]: I was bombing there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck it, no bucket.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Try holding a bunch of cameras.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys, yeah, Dusty's, I'll meet you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go to Redshire.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go down Redshire and go to
the Westin real quick.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we will, gentlemen.
We'll see you in the next one.
