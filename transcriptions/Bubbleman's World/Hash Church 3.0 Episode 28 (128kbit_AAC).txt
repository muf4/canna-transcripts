[SPEAKER_12]: Right, look at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: On YouTube.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, this is just media tech.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning, Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Hash Church 3.0, episode 28.
[SPEAKER_15]: Episode 28.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the... Wow, we're up to that
already, huh?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was fast.
[SPEAKER_12]: And frozen.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a good sign.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good, good.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought my internet connection's a
little iffy.
[SPEAKER_15]: So let me share this into the room real
quick so everyone can come over here and
[SPEAKER_15]: hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: This meeting is being live streamed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that through your speaker?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to the YouTube to turn it on to
figure out what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I went there and went to an older
video and it's like, hi, it's Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_15]: I should turn my camera on, for gosh
sakes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, everybody's just looking at me and
going, wow, look at that stoner.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's going on with that guy?
[SPEAKER_15]: He seems hardcore.
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of stoner, here comes Kylie
stoner.
[SPEAKER_12]: Morning, Kylie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's a holiday morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess it's the holiday season per
se for those who like holidays to the
[SPEAKER_11]: season.
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, pretty excited because next
weekend is the Emerald Cups Ball,
[SPEAKER_11]: the Harvest Ball.
[SPEAKER_11]: So people are, needless to say,
excited in Northern California because we
[SPEAKER_11]: finally get to hang out just in time for
another variant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless, it's exciting to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, everybody, please send out love and
prayers for Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade's kind of at home suffering.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been working with us at his VAC and
unfortunately has some health conditions
[SPEAKER_11]: that have him down and in bed.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's suffering right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody who can send love to Wade,
please.
[SPEAKER_11]: Reach out to him and give him our best.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's suffering, unfortunately,
for some broken ribs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's just having a hard time right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So any of those who you know, Wade,
please reach out to him, send him love and
[SPEAKER_11]: give him support.
[SPEAKER_11]: He really needs it right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's in a low spot, health wise,
and he's working on getting his way back.
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's he's hurting and needs love.
[SPEAKER_11]: So please send it all to Wade right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely sending it to Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: I spoke with him briefly a week or two
ago, and he was telling me about his ribs
[SPEAKER_15]: and his back and how he's just kind of
laid out right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's that's terrible to hear,
especially because Wade's just the
[SPEAKER_15]: greatest person ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like the most empathetic,
compassionate, like kind human being.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can just hear it in his voice whenever
he speaks.
[SPEAKER_15]: So our love is coming out to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wade, the whole Hash Church family is
thinking about you today and sending
[SPEAKER_15]: sending good vibes as 100 plus people in
the room right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: And welcome to Kylie Stoner and Colin
Palmer.
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to finally meet you, Kylie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been following your work for quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some really amazing stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, still haven't had a chance to
try your stuff, but I can't wait to the
[SPEAKER_04]: day when I get to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you doing all the trips across the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: During COVID, hopefully your gear is
getting out to all the amazing people in
[SPEAKER_04]: the community to be able to understand how
incredible the experience is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know, you know, a lot of people,
everyone that's tried your your device has
[SPEAKER_04]: been hands down seems to say all across
the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, the best that they've ever
experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So kudos to you, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indux Labs, Indux Labs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been trying to like this whole like
this the day I hooked up with Kylie,
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God, they made it so you
couldn't ship their units to Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it was like, what?
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you mean you can't ship these
units to Canada?
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're a little hurting up here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did get an induction unit and I don't
know what company it was from.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me grab it real quick.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is not what you've got going on,
Kylie, in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the problem with this particular
Indux unit is that it's just they haven't
[SPEAKER_15]: figured out how to how to make it more
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just like it's insane.
[SPEAKER_15]: It like you can turn the bowl to like red
hot vapor in like in half a second.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't even know the name of the
company, but this is the one that I got
[SPEAKER_15]: years ago and kind of got to taste,
got to see basically what it was
[SPEAKER_15]: potentially about.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't the name of this thing is like
Lodo Labs or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you familiar with this unit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, listen, I'm not trying to
bash the company, but it's just it's not
[SPEAKER_15]: it's too much.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no way to dial it to make it more
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, honestly, Vapix Hale is a much
better unit for terpenes to this thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the thing that you have,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is off camera in regards to setting
up this sort of think tank in regards to
[SPEAKER_15]: sensory science and from everything I've
heard from Tom solventless mind and from
[SPEAKER_15]: Nick Ziegler and from even Skunkman Sam,
who has one of your units.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just it's it's the one that I'm
jonesing for so hardcore because I want to
[SPEAKER_15]: be able to dial in those profiles where
you can kind of go through the terpene
[SPEAKER_15]: profile, accessing different bouquets of
flavor by just using, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: that that sensitive, I guess, capabilities
that your unit has.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe maybe you can tell everyone a little
bit about the unit and maybe talk about
[SPEAKER_15]: what inspired to create it and what was
behind creating it and what you're kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: hoping that the unit helps, you know,
unveil for the people of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: community and industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it was this this discovery that,
you know, the size, shape, quantity and
[SPEAKER_02]: composition of the heating elements that
you're loading into the vial control the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature ramp and the paper texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that was determined, it was just plug
and play, try everything possible to dial
[SPEAKER_02]: it in to get those different terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go extremely low and slow,
like from room temperature to 400 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: over the course of 500 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the units capable of, you know,
hot dabs in six seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can use it as an analytical
tool if you want by running the slower
[SPEAKER_02]: ramps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, some people just like
pulling huge clouds, and that's possible
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we go through the difference
between, you know, convection,
[SPEAKER_15]: conduction, induction?
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you talk a little bit about the
sort of popular vaporizers that are in the
[SPEAKER_15]: market and why the index is really quite
something different?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it all comes down to temperature
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm using induction to heat a
heating element, but it's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: conduction that's heating the substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: So induction is a clean form of heating
and you have extreme amount of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just found that that gives
more control than say heating an
[SPEAKER_02]: insulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, insulators aren't the greatest
at heating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're pure, but you lose control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I have titanium elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have steel elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have glass elements with a steel core.
[SPEAKER_02]: The titanium ones have the most control
because you're directly heating the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface in a slow manner through eddy
current.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a resistor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when you use the glow sticks,
I call them, which are the steel elements
[SPEAKER_02]: encased in glass, that heats up a lot
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that energy in the core has to
transfer through the glass shell to then
[SPEAKER_02]: be concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smooth presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just don't have quite the control
you have when you're directly heating an
[SPEAKER_02]: element like titanium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Kylie, question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've spoken to other researchers that
are looking at just conduction and just
[SPEAKER_04]: how heat and thermodynamics are working.
[SPEAKER_04]: In your experience, are you finding,
most of the individuals I'm speaking to
[SPEAKER_04]: seem to believe that 316 is like,
in terms of a heating element,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a material for heating, it is kind of
the best in terms of thermal, like the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that it heats up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're finding?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not saying I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just really curious to understand your
opinion, I guess, because I guess these
[SPEAKER_04]: are really opinions at this stage of the
game at some respect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I put 316L, 304, 304L.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are austenitic stainless steels,
medical grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're non-magnetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they heat similar to the titanium,
a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be honest, you get better flavor
off the grade two titanium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my hunch was like,
interesting, 316 or 304 sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, Mark, but at the same time,
it seems like it's inefficient in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: the way it rants through.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking at it from a curve,
it seems like it's just like a triangle
[SPEAKER_04]: wave or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just like peaks and then goes down
where it seems like other elements have
[SPEAKER_04]: more of a curve to it, the way that it
kind of ramps up and goes through the
[SPEAKER_04]: different ranges of temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because let's face it, all of these
chemicals have a boiling point,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And going through those temperature ranges
really, I think, does help the experience
[SPEAKER_04]: and the profile and taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dial it in to go through whatever
temperature range at the rate you want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a little bit of experimentation
to plug in the different heating,
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly the effect you're going for,
both flavor and cerebral effect combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 316, that can be manipulated size and
shape of it, kind of tailor the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature ramps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played around with it some, but really
I'm just working with the grade titanium
[SPEAKER_02]: and some other materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on a new material that has
given me really good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not willing to say what it is right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think out of all the
elements you have in terms of just
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, in terms of taste and
delivery, are you feeling that there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: better, more efficient one than the other?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are they just, like you're saying,
just different from one another?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can load 13 1.6 millimeter
titanium grade two rods into the vial at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time and get one experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add one, it heats up a little bit
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take one away, it heats up a little
bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you tailor the experience that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's all determined by the heating
element.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about the, or sorry,
Kyle, are we talking about the index?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got me well and truly fated at
MJBizCon and Vic just a couple of years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember very well how you've been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working with fine folk like yourself and
Marcus and getting to talk all the fun
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to BizCon again, this got a
little reluctant when I saw you out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but back then it was like no one knew
about the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a beautiful paperweight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people are starting to learn about it,
what it's capable of and the response is
[SPEAKER_02]: very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I pimp it hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I describe it is like,
it's like being able to consume via GC
[SPEAKER_03]: because the, the, I mean the sequential
elution of the compounds that we,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I experienced was, you know,
like it was like, okay, well there's
[SPEAKER_03]: limonene, there's ossemonine, there's
terpenolene and then, oh, there's the THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it was, it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing is, is you can control,
since you have, you know, control over the
[SPEAKER_02]: ramp, you can control the compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to just work your way through
their individual boiling points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you cut it off when you get
the effect you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds incredible, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just Jones and I can't tell you,
it's been like two and a half years that
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been trying to get my hands on one of
these units.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, many years ago when someone
said, oh, what do you see as the perfect
[SPEAKER_15]: futuristic sort of medical device?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, wow, I mean, in a perfect
world, it would be pretty cool if you had
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of a box, very much like what yours
looks like.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I picked your little glass vials
that kind of fit inside the box with like
[SPEAKER_15]: all the novel cannabinoids that you want
to have access to all of the terpene
[SPEAKER_15]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then hopefully, you know, or,
you know, the deeper aromatic volatiles
[SPEAKER_15]: that are, that are having an effect on it
as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then just dialing in, you know,
through some type of an algorithm exactly
[SPEAKER_15]: like, oh, what cultivar is the Ghost Train
Haze?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is what Ghost Train Haze is.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you just plug it into the machine
and the machine just takes out little bits
[SPEAKER_15]: of whatever it needs to create that
profile.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that you're good halfway there
with this unit.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've only heard great things from
amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy to hear all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so excited to be a part of this
project and finally get this thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, used in an incredible way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've done, but, you know,
I'm kind of limited in my capacity,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to have you guys on board is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what Kylie's talking about is we'll
give a little bit of a public mention,
[SPEAKER_15]: just Nick and I have been kind of going
back and forth on email.
[SPEAKER_15]: We brought in Kylie a while ago and some
other sort of people just trying to create
[SPEAKER_15]: a little bit of a think tank, you know,
like a little bit of a sensory science
[SPEAKER_15]: think tank with a group of people,
you know, inclusive, of course,
[SPEAKER_15]: and just trying to get it to the point
where we can have, like Nick mentioned,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, having a shared lexicon would be
very important, but also having,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, a shared user unit that people
are able to go through these different,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, experiences, have these
different effects from different plants
[SPEAKER_15]: and extracts.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just kind of an exciting rabbit
hole that I've been looking to go down
[SPEAKER_15]: further and further.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, since I met Nick and Jeremy,
and I heard the term sensory science,
[SPEAKER_15]: it seems to be hand in hand with what,
you know, our discussions are here on Hash
[SPEAKER_15]: Church.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, that's going to happen in
the future, sort of behind closed doors.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I figured, hey, why don't we,
you know, get on a Hash Church and have a
[SPEAKER_15]: little bit of a conversation about... Lost
Marcus.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Starlink.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to happen like that to him from
time to time.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to stretch.
Elon.
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Elon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus, we lost you for a minute there,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys just keep going.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just blowing smoke up you guys' ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least you're honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I felt a tingle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I interject here a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that I was working on
the last time I was on, or I sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: wrapped that up in my former life,
was really trying to establish a unified
[SPEAKER_03]: sensory program for hops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, you know, a tremendous amount
of overlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, the experience that I had was
that, you know, developing a system and a
[SPEAKER_03]: program for characterizing aromatics and,
you know, eventually, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: quantifying them, or quantitating them,
if you're talking in GCLC land.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case was really getting
everybody on the same page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so using certain standards to define
what the principal components were that
[SPEAKER_03]: were leading to the aromatics,
and then what we would agree to call them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in creating a shared sensory
lexicon, we're able to then assign numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: to the levels that we detect them at,
and we can characterize people as well in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of their sensitivities and
blindnesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that allowed us to do was to
start to create a sort of a rating scale
[SPEAKER_03]: for each characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes it would be citrus underscore
lime, citrus underscore grapefruit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so on and so forth like that,
or tropical fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fruits underscore guava underscore mango
and use all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allowed us to create much better
pictures of the botanical in front of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was because we discovered that
basically a lot of the compounds that are
[SPEAKER_03]: important for identifying a given chemo
var of hop were not actually relevant to
[SPEAKER_03]: beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't make it a solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for cannabis, it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ability to characterize the
components and then the sensory picture of
[SPEAKER_03]: what was there was massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with Dr. Russo's work on the entourage
effect and the impact of the aromatic
[SPEAKER_03]: fractions on the therapeutic benefits of
cannabis, I think that there's the time is
[SPEAKER_03]: ripe for really getting together and
creating a industry standard lexicon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily that we're going to
dictate what people smell and taste and
[SPEAKER_03]: think about it, but that we at least have
reference standards so that even though to
[SPEAKER_03]: me it might smell like, say durian,
because I've been to Thailand and grew up
[SPEAKER_03]: in Southeast Asia, someone else might
describe that as garlic, pineapple,
[SPEAKER_03]: and diesel in their own mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we agree to call it X, Y, or Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each region is going to have its own
lexicon.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the Midwest might have
something called snicker salad,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I was introduced to recently and was
very confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a range of flavors that I was
familiar with at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no vegetable or fruit in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does smell kind of very
distinctive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so someone from the Midwest would say,
oh, yeah, that's X, Y, or Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone from, say, Seattle would go,
what the hell are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, it smells like chocolate,
caramel, whipped cream, and marshmallows,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are the principal ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is that our lexicons are
informed not only by our physical
[SPEAKER_03]: limitations, so either our sensitivities
or blindnesses, like anosmias to certain
[SPEAKER_03]: smells, but also our cultural context.
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone who is in North Asia,
Chinese, Korean, or in Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though they're both in Asia and they
share a lot of things, they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have very different sensory lexicons based
on their exposure to food, cuisine,
[SPEAKER_03]: and tradition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can get everybody sort of
talking on the same page with regards to
[SPEAKER_03]: the compounds, we can develop sensory
thesauruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, in the Western US, we tend to use
these descriptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they refer to these compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in China, they use these
descriptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're referring to the same
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can then create not only a lexicon or a
translation, but also the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually quantitate based on people's
noses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to use GCs for all of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But based on people's noses, we can get a
pretty good idea of what that strain is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stretch goal beyond this is then
to look at if we can apply the same
[SPEAKER_03]: methodology to the typing of human
phenotypes and the interaction with the
[SPEAKER_03]: various chemovars so that we can see that,
OK, if you are from this genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: background, there's an 80% or 70% chance
you have all of these receptors and these
[SPEAKER_03]: genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your ECS works this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're ex-weight, if you're male or
female, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any underlying conditions,
we might be able to then start to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to predict in general, not necessarily
specifically, what the experience most
[SPEAKER_03]: people would have with a given strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's incredibly powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now, it's kind of a roll of
the dice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So roll the dice and developing a phonetic
and then ultimately a language that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: agree on to your point, some sort of
system or periods of systems that relates
[SPEAKER_04]: to one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I guess this may be directed towards
Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how do we really start to encompass
and circle around the ideology of this is
[SPEAKER_04]: right for a patient A and patient B,
but not patient C?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that seems like nearly impossible to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have such dynamic ECS,
so understudied, and we have such a long
[SPEAKER_04]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So circling around the ideology that we're
going to say, hey, definitively A and B
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to be this and C is going to be
that, I feel like we have so much research
[SPEAKER_04]: to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wonder, what are the thoughts
that we all collectively have today that
[SPEAKER_04]: could get us closer to understanding how
we could get towards talking in those
[SPEAKER_04]: ways?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not saying that we're going to
definitively define something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what are the steps you think that we
can take to get closer to that?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was specific that we kind of upended
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The team that I built upended it because
we saw this path forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we only got as far, we only got 60% of
the way there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of why I mentioned that to
get to the quantitation and analysis of
[SPEAKER_03]: the effects, the therapeutic effects,
that will take RCTs and clinical-level
[SPEAKER_03]: trials in terms of quality, not
necessarily massive size, to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: determine it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would want to use diverse
populations and so multiple countries,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also multiple genetic backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will take a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we get everybody used to talking
and used to thinking in shared terms,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is an achievable goal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I think that the fact that,
I mean, just looking at fitness and
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at health and looking at what
people consume for food, everyone wakes up
[SPEAKER_10]: at a different time, goes to bed at a
different time, has a different schedule,
[SPEAKER_10]: metabolic, some of them aren't getting
enough sunlight, some aren't, their
[SPEAKER_10]: circadian rhythm is off.
[SPEAKER_10]: All these things are wrong with people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that for us to sit here and
try to, and I love the idea, but I just
[SPEAKER_10]: think that the approach, we can't even get
people to agree on a vaccine.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't get people to agree on anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't understand how, I think this is
such a huge task because I take all of you
[SPEAKER_10]: right now, us as the subject.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how do you apply this even to us?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're educated.
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an understanding of these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can communicate at this level.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know what esters are and flavonoids,
and we understand all these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's so slow to the process of
us educating the rest of the people and
[SPEAKER_10]: then expecting them, like what Colin said,
it's A, B, and C.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't see it being possible,
except in a way where it's a number of
[SPEAKER_10]: questions that allow people to let us know
how they feel, to let us know after
[SPEAKER_10]: they've used something, how it made them
feel.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sort of just let them develop that for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because even just, like I said,
in fitness, it's like, I've got people
[SPEAKER_10]: coming to me and being like, oh,
you know, this much protein and take this
[SPEAKER_10]: and take that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And half of that shit, you know,
I could drink a little bit of salt water
[SPEAKER_10]: for a workout and get a better pre-workout
than most of the other shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's these little tiny things.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are selling something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would feel like from an educated
standpoint, collectively, it would almost
[SPEAKER_10]: appear like we were trying to fit people
into a box that don't fit into.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, even if the years and
years and years and years of, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: Etienne, you know, is a perfect example of
having a dispensary and always putting
[SPEAKER_10]: together these really well thought out,
you know, interactive experiences with
[SPEAKER_10]: people to get an understanding of what
they think of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like people vary too much,
cannabis varies too much, and you're
[SPEAKER_10]: intoxicating people at the same time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's almost like the fifth hour of a
beer festival.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little foggy, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it gets to be that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, there's always going to be
different levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel like it's such a great
conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: But man, like Marcus always says,
hurting cats, like you're hurting fucking
[SPEAKER_10]: countries of cats at this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you're standing in Australia in the
middle of the jump, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_10]: middle of the outback and there's a
zillion cats.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I look at it as, you know,
for us collectively, I think that it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: series of questions and it's a series,
like a comfortable, real just,
[SPEAKER_10]: oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the people that are intelligent enough
to want to answer those questions because
[SPEAKER_10]: they want that understanding, they're
going to go forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we really need to admit to ourselves
that 90% of the people who consume
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis are just trying to get high.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just trying to forget about the
dude that just cut them off and all these
[SPEAKER_10]: other things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to accomplish this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that it's going to look like
Charlie standing at the board,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, with all that shit behind him
and the crazy hair, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear to God that I think that every one
of us wants this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that we will all be dead by
the time it's done.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make it not worth doing then?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, I love doing shit like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and then that's kind of my point
is that this is what everybody said about
[SPEAKER_03]: the hop industry is that we could never
get anybody to agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Muehlgaard's very simplistic
definition of like seven different major
[SPEAKER_03]: attributes from the German perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always say I'm on the record of making
fun of the Germans, but they started it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's be fair here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also were we were vertically
integrated as a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we controlled not only the farming,
but also the processing and the
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution to clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this would have to be an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trying to develop an industry
standard and not trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to box people in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to give people more
information about what's in their
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we say that, you know,
we'll be able to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I say that the effects are like
that's way in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those results are way far down line.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least being able to show that this
one tastes like citrus grapefruit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this one tastes like citrus lime
because these compounds are in this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it will originally need to involve
a lot of GC work, but it will also need us
[SPEAKER_03]: to come together as a group slash
industry, so people with dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: owners, sensory scientists, growers,
processors and say, OK, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not trying to put people into we're
not trying to force a people into
[SPEAKER_03]: something they don't want to do,
but we're going to try to create at least
[SPEAKER_03]: a standard that people can use if they so
choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's really if it's done correctly,
people start to start to use that that
[SPEAKER_03]: that that that lexicon, that that language
to describe things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sort of grows organically from
there because we are all using.
[SPEAKER_03]: We agree that even though we may think
this might trigger a different concept,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I like to use the example of,
you know, someone once gave me notes like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, this was this reminds me of when I
walked into my grandmother's house and she
[SPEAKER_03]: had sugar cones rather than waffle cones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, that's very specific to you
and very meaningful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably means a lot, but I have no
idea what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so we want to try to limit people's
like, oh, what a chunker, sort of the bro
[SPEAKER_03]: science and the like, dude, this is like.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still can't get past Indica and sativa
with people, OK, simplest of nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I respect where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as somebody who's been doing this for
20 years, I agree exactly what,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, Addison was stating is that
there's a small percentage of people who
[SPEAKER_11]: have fucks to give about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The rest of the people, you know,
don't understand, but I'm one of those
[SPEAKER_11]: people who has that fucks to give.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to understand because the
biggest problem I get from patients every
[SPEAKER_11]: single day is, hi, I've got cancer.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's my cancer, but hi, I've got this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's my this button?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, sorry, it's completely
subjective.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to go try everything to get an
understanding.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do like the new way that science is
going in the sense that we're going by
[SPEAKER_11]: terpene profiles now, as opposed to going
across this Indica sativa misinformation,
[SPEAKER_11]: which has so much of the public confused.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're coming in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want something that doesn't lock me down
on the couch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: What what doesn't?
[SPEAKER_11]: And they look at me like, I don't know
exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And since it's completely subjective,
all we can go is by science to help us
[SPEAKER_11]: arrive there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So science, I think, is key once we
because there's people right now that are
[SPEAKER_11]: actually using gene science of humans to
try to match them with terpene profiles to
[SPEAKER_11]: supposedly help a human.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's a a new frontier that
sounds like a lot of quackery.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it has some basis in real science that
has to be executed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And already, I mean, when did McPartlin
and Rob Clark put out their book educating
[SPEAKER_11]: people on Indica and sativa and how many
years later, we're still talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: So unfortunately, because we change laws
and then educate about people about
[SPEAKER_11]: things, we've got a steep uphill of
education.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to see more of what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I it's a long way to we arrive
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm interested in the path and the
journey.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a quick question for everyone,
because it just and I hate to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it that occurs when each of us gets
sick of a strain or tired of a strain and
[SPEAKER_10]: then has to go to other strains?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mean, I've got the legends kit
in front of me and there's a I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: the profiles are crazy on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: But even when it goes from from my taste
or my preference to go from rosin to melt,
[SPEAKER_10]: what it you know, because that's why I'm
I'm sort of like, we ever pull this off,
[SPEAKER_10]: because even in my own self, you know,
it's a cloudy day and this and there's all
[SPEAKER_10]: these things that apply.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be great to lay out some
or to begin the process of of of getting
[SPEAKER_10]: this out there and sort of saying,
hey, lemon, lime, all these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it seems like such a giant task to to
tackle what I'd like to what I'd like to
[SPEAKER_10]: understand more is how you guys actually
tackled it on your side.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the you know, the fact that,
you know, when you're talking about hops
[SPEAKER_10]: and terpenes and beer, you know,
of course, it's it's you put that glass up
[SPEAKER_10]: to your face, you give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_10]: If the smell is OK, you're going to give
it a sip.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you if this if it's in your mouth and
it tastes right, you're going to swallow
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's that sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wonder for you guys, like,
what is it that how did you guys get to
[SPEAKER_10]: that point?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, to get that understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was OK, I will describe sort of what
I set up from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'll try to go through the
program overview in general of how I built
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can go go from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this information, this is like
well documented on on the Akamachick's
[SPEAKER_03]: website.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, we when you when you when
you assess a botanical, there are there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of different things that matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is a true to type value, which is that
this is consistent across this variety
[SPEAKER_03]: within, you know, a standard couple of
standard deviations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So generally to off of the mean for its
environment, because there's a strong G by
[SPEAKER_03]: E interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might see this in a if you're
growing cocoa or for cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cocoa, if you're going deep water culture,
if you're going living soil, if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going semi semi-organic, you know,
so on and so forth, and you're using LEDs
[SPEAKER_03]: versus HIDs versus so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all those are all factors that
need to be considered in outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's infinitely more complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you have that true to type score,
you have, you know, it's a plus one,
[SPEAKER_03]: meaning one standard deviation over in X,
Y and Z characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we didn't have those
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we didn't know what we were looking
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were looking at a PCA to start with,
which was total oil and the like total
[SPEAKER_03]: alpha, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so basically it would be like looking
at total amount of aromatic compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: possible and THC count.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is pretty that's about where the
industry was two years ago, three years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's getting it's getting getting
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from that point on, we're like,
OK, well, hang on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot more going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used a standard metric for analyzing
botanical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So using a GC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did a sensory evaluation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And using the standard method,
we noticed that these two different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties were grown by the same growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was actually nice control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're showing up as statistically
indistinguishable using the seven point
[SPEAKER_03]: metric for the oils that were being used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was happened to be mosaic and what
is now called Sabro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody in the beer industry can tell
you that those two hops do not smell
[SPEAKER_03]: anything alike.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we noticed that, OK, there is some
there's something that our standard method
[SPEAKER_03]: is not picking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started doing a two pronged
approach, which is that we sensory and we
[SPEAKER_03]: analyze through sensory every single lot
and we decide the terms ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that took about six months to decide
what the lexicon was going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did, you know, we take the major
category like herbal, woody, earthy,
[SPEAKER_03]: fruity, dank, vegetal, onion, garlic,
slash diesel flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like all those things together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might have to do that in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you take all those and write.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you develop your basically flavor wheel
and you say, OK, in fruit you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: option of citrus, tropical, you know,
palm fruit, red berry, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you specify beyond that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in your berry, you can say
blackberry, raspberry, blueberry,
[SPEAKER_03]: marionberry, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your citrus, you've got lemon,
lime, grapefruit, you know, citron,
[SPEAKER_03]: yuzu, tangerine, you know, all those
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can assign a number,
which was a one to five scale,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, or one to ten scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can be any integer between it can
be like five point five or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incidentally, we found we got better data
with a smaller scale because people are
[SPEAKER_03]: lazy and they gravitate towards the mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what that allowed us to do was then
say, OK, this is what we are talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the terms we're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we're describing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we put those samples through a
GC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had we've got two different GC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had two different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two different GC.
[SPEAKER_03]: One with an olfactory port and one with a
sulfur, a sulfur chemiluminescence
[SPEAKER_03]: detector, which allowed us to look at
thiols and thioates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we're able to do is,
you know, smell the sample as it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: through the GC and correlate each compound
as it alludes off to a descriptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just speak into it and say,
OK, this is a one through five citrus
[SPEAKER_03]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a peach.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pear.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an apricot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that did was allow us to start
creating, you know, maps of the different
[SPEAKER_03]: strains or different different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick, can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool topic here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So GC stands for gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for those of you who don't know,
you're taking a sample of material and
[SPEAKER_01]: injecting it into an injector port that's
typically at 200 centigrade or sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we keep ours at 200 in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly, if you look at a terpene
profile at room temperature and you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at a terpene profile at 200 degrees
centigrade, you could very much see
[SPEAKER_01]: differences because chemistry happens,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just assume that you're going to
inject this stuff in an oxygen atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: heat these compounds up, which have
multiple sites of unsaturation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're not going to undergo some type
of chemical transformation by the time you
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the either olfactory or whatever
detector you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you reconcile a room temperature
to terpene profile with a terpene profile
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been heated to 200 degrees?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first of all, you should get a GC that
has the capability to do different ramps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you start at slightly below room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to keep this low tech,
a low tech question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, we use different temp ramps,
just kind of like what Kylie was talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about earlier, which is that if you find
the vaporization point under different
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions, you can run under vacuum,
you can run under pressure, and even
[SPEAKER_03]: stretch those chromatograms out a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are able to capture what is coming
off at each given temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for cannabis, it's almost kind of
besides the point because our room
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature is not how we consume these.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's sometimes how we extract them,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess back to another question I
had, how are you differentiating
[SPEAKER_04]: mono-terps and sesquiterps from other
types of compounds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how is that data together reading to
you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that actually giving you some kind of
wherewithal as to, OK, this variety is
[SPEAKER_04]: reacting this way at this temperature,
but it's not reacting that way at,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say, 180 versus 120?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a couple of different layers
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about just basically,
I'm talking about getting it into the
[SPEAKER_03]: detector first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go with that, OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have reference libraries for all
identified compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a NIST is a common one,
but there's some other ones you can build
[SPEAKER_03]: your own if you identify them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know the attributes of those
compounds under at ambient pressure and
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature and what their vaporization
temperatures are, what the VP is,
[SPEAKER_04]: the PPM, things like that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So PPM is just a measurement of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what the average threshold is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ChemSpider and PubChem and the Good
Sense company have a lot of good data on
[SPEAKER_03]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But their databases are not always
complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: The NIST is a fantastic one, National
Institute of something or other,
[SPEAKER_03]: but databases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Institute of Standards and
Technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you compare these to what are known,
and you get a confidence interval.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, you say, OK, this is
geraniol versus geranyl acetate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geranyl acetate, it's a 67% chance that
it's going to be general acetate,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a 95% chance that it's geranyl.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's likely geranyl, OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is some coalition sometimes
where you get things that go together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also get compounds that interfere
with each other when they're going through
[SPEAKER_03]: the ionization process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by running multiple runs under
slightly different parameters,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can change those coalition
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if you are running
triplicate, so you do your initial run
[SPEAKER_03]: with your base standard in triplicate,
and then you compare those results,
[SPEAKER_03]: you say, OK, well, this peak is wider than
it normally is against my reference
[SPEAKER_03]: standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there might be something else that's
coming out with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You increase the pressure, and you change
the temperature ramps, and you try to
[SPEAKER_03]: split those peaks up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see that, OK, actually,
it was an example is farnesine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Transbeta farnesine is the standard it's
used.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's actually a bunch of different
isomers in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can look at one single peak is
about, say, on a normal chromatogram,
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes out at 27 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks, say, this wide, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you actually look at all the ones
that include all the isomers of farnesine,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a peak that's this wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you know there's something else
going there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And farnesine doesn't have that many
things that co-alute with it, so we're
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just use it for the entire family of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't interact differently with
our sensory program, or organoleptic
[SPEAKER_03]: senses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you start doing that, you start
getting a much better picture of when
[SPEAKER_03]: things come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the real strength of doing it this way
is when you link it with sensory,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you start smelling them as they're
coming off together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes you'll get big peaks on
your chromatogram, and none of your
[SPEAKER_03]: panelists smell anything when that thing
goes through, which means it's an
[SPEAKER_03]: aromatically inactive compound as far as
humans and as far as your specific sample,
[SPEAKER_03]: your panel sample goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there's other times when you
don't see a peak and you detect something
[SPEAKER_03]: that is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this happened for us with a very
specific aroma of peach and apricot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we weren't seeing anything on one of
our GCs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that told us that something was eluding
at that moment, but it was outside the
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we changed the resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lo and behold, we were able to
identify two compounds that were
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with four our sensory panel of
about 40 people, peach and apricot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sensory helps inform the quantitative
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the science helps create
reference standards for sensory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to do both together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the third.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the other third piece, I think,
that at least I believe through the years
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've come to really respect more is
the psychology of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how, as a younger self, you're trained
literally like all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are all trained to learn and know
things such as taste, smell, things that
[SPEAKER_04]: we love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they carry into today as an older
self.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when someone says they like linoleum
forward things, it's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: did you like grape juice as a kid?
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the time, it's yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I love calio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did you love citrus as a kid?
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these things are starting to make
more sense as I get older.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we interact with more and more
patients and speak in these terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the dumbed down version,
the layman's term, if you will,
[SPEAKER_04]: of it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's extremely informative
to the bioassay aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that actually will directly inform the
other data that you see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can now match real world with
robotics and science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that to me is a very difficult thing
as we're talking about today, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the unicorn, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just feels to me like there's more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these things together, I think,
can help inform one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the art and science in a way.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just excited to where it will lead us.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, think about when we didn't know
how to grow a flower plant and everyone
[SPEAKER_15]: was just growing leaf.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then someone was like, hey,
you got to cut the light down and you'll
[SPEAKER_15]: get some buds on there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's great things that we have yet
to uncover.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the rabbit hole that Nick is
mentioning, it's not supposed to be the be
[SPEAKER_15]: all end all, but it's going to create some
incredible side missions in the game of
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: The dialogue.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And while.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I want to play a little bit of
the devil's advocate while I really
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciate all of the standards and
everything that, you know, sort of puts it
[SPEAKER_09]: into common language.
[SPEAKER_09]: It also puts it into common language.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is the same as when you
standardize anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So say when the Phillips screwdriver was
standardized, it took away a thousand
[SPEAKER_09]: different instruments and different tools
that other people were using all around
[SPEAKER_09]: the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what this does is it gives us a common
language but it also takes away
[SPEAKER_09]: individualistic language.
[SPEAKER_09]: So me as a practitioner, when I'm talking
to people, I want them to use their
[SPEAKER_09]: language of whatever they want,
because that tells them more.
[SPEAKER_09]: That tells me more about their
constitution.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if they're using language that is
already, you know, in some kind of a
[SPEAKER_09]: format, then they're using someone else's
language.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using someone else's tool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what concerns me is in standardizing
cannabis and standardizing botanicals is
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're taking away a lot of cultural
values.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're taking away, you know, the language
that people have with this very sacred
[SPEAKER_09]: plant that they've been long term
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what worries me about science is a
bunch of English speaking white people
[SPEAKER_09]: creating a language for people all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: That have a very intuitive, very sacred
relationship with this plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that sacred relationship is also how I
personally, as a health practitioner,
[SPEAKER_09]: treat people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they're telling me, you know,
this reminds me of grandma's closet
[SPEAKER_09]: because of a cedar, you know, the cedar
closet or something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, or mothballs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that may not be on, you know,
this particular standard, but that tells
[SPEAKER_09]: me more about that person.
[SPEAKER_09]: It tells me more about the relationship
that they might be having, A, with the
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine and also, B, with whatever
healing tones that they're going through
[SPEAKER_09]: or energy at that particular time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I really can relish in the fact
that we have a philic screwdriver and I
[SPEAKER_09]: can carry it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet again, I'm not seeing all of the
tools that are possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: historically.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it worries me of this sort of
homogenization that we are creating within
[SPEAKER_09]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, creating hoops that we can't jump
through further on because this is a
[SPEAKER_09]: fractal medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every single person has a different
relationship with it and it fractals in
[SPEAKER_09]: different heat, in different areas,
in different zones.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you said it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single person has their own and this
just happens to be ours.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you have to accept it just like you
want to accept yours.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're both just as valid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, here's another, let me,
I'm worried that people are, I'm worried
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've misinterpreted kind of what
the goal is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is not to put people into boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is to give us terms so that we
can run it against, you know, physical
[SPEAKER_03]: science and chemistry to try to
characterize lots of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not telling people what they're
going to feel or how they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: react to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea of a shared lexicon is not to
limit, but to in fact give greater
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lexicon is not static.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be continuously evolving and
increasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and it does, as you pointed out,
you know, each patient has a different
[SPEAKER_03]: historical relationship to these,
the sensations that arise from these
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if leveraged judiciously, you can
create a lexicon that encompasses,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 90, 95% of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use it for, like, as you said,
in different cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: In different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: For different, you know, genetics that are
related to different people's
[SPEAKER_03]: sensitivities to smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't have to be limiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't have to be static.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can continuously evolve and grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I presented a very
simplified version, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: my initial draft of the program that I
designed had a drop down menu of at least
[SPEAKER_03]: like 20 different iterations of aromas for
each subcategory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was too bulky to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of, you know, simplifying it,
and then we also allowed people to put
[SPEAKER_03]: down their own notes in everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this, so this, like, you
mentioned mothballs and cedar,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, mothballs are camphor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cedar is setterine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of other different compounds,
and alpha-pinon and beta-pinene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, mothballs are naphthalene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even a terpene at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fused aromatic compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smell camphor and you smell
naphthalene, you'll see the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, that's weird because I've got camphor
mothballs as well, which is maybe because
[SPEAKER_03]: it was in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they tried to make like a more
natural version of the mothballs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the mothballs in my grandmother's
closet were the old ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the super-kenny ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point is, the thing is also,
sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that naphthalene
is a heavy hydrocarbon that I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: found was toxic, so they tried to phase
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But years ago, that was, that's what they
used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And naphthalene also comes from,
you can get it from petrochemicals,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can also get it from pine sap,
from certain pines, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And creosote bushes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a quick backup, though,
is that one thing that I also want to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about is that we're not discussing
terpenes because the terps are only a
[SPEAKER_03]: fraction of what is aromatically active in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.
Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you see all these people talk about
terpenes and where I get kind of confused
[SPEAKER_01]: on this is as a chemist, I think of
terpenes as oligomers of isoprene,
[SPEAKER_01]: completely hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you have an alcohol,
or as soon as you have an oxygen or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur in there, it's no longer a terpene,
it's a terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be a terpene, but now these
things are doing chemistry and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: making terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And terpenoids is a much wider class of
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So linalool, that's a terpenoid,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a terpene alcohol,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this speaks, Nick, to the broken
lexicon in cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that, you know, whether it's
sativa indica, or, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly confusing all kinds of terms
when it comes to trying.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it also, it also shows the flip side
mark of the shared lexicon that people
[SPEAKER_15]: have learned about terpenes in the last
several years that they're all now using.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that's empowering
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like, you know, I love the idea
that science is over here doing this,
[SPEAKER_15]: and you've got the more spiritual aspect
over here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the beautiful thing about cannabis is
exactly what Kelly said.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a fractal, which means everything has
its place.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, regardless of how you're going
about doing it, this plant is somehow
[SPEAKER_15]: getting us to discover new things about
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to me, you know, I love very much the
sort of, you know, conscious, spiritual,
[SPEAKER_15]: almost psychedelic aspect of understanding
the moon and the regenerative farming and,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, being synergistic with Mother
Earth.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also love the deep chemistry of it
and how that sort of interacts.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, the feelings that I'm
having, I want to understand all of these
[SPEAKER_15]: things.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really kind of have a foot in both,
in both places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I couldn't agree more,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, Mark, it's like, look,
this is only healthy because there's so
[SPEAKER_04]: many times when I wish I could have these
broader conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mark said it beautifully, terpenoids
is a great term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just say them aromatic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't, I just even go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the problem there, Colin,
the problem there to a chemist like
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, when I hear aromatic, yeah,
I guess in a general sense, that's aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: containing compounds or compounds that
have an aroma, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But aromatic to a chemist, to an organic
chemist, means a benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a tryptamine ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's got four N plus two pi
electrons is an aromatic species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those things are like noxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't smell good at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have, don't, don't have a
smell at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but they're, you know, again,
aroma containing molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I don't mind using the
slang, terps, because terps to me
[SPEAKER_01]: encompasses terpenes, sesquicentos,
quiterpenes, diterpenes, but it also
[SPEAKER_01]: encompasses the wider class of molecule,
which is terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the terpenoids I think that
really create a huge amount of molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in the, in the sense of
fragrances that we're able to sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the smell of sense, or I'm
sorry, the sense of smell rather,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the most primitive sense that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the first, before vision,
before sight, before touch, smell was a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very important evolutionary trait to
have for survival.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what, one other thing I wanted to
bring up is, is environment for these
[SPEAKER_04]: certain varietals.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they, they're going to express
different traits from the chemotype
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single time you change its feeding
cycle, its BPD, PPFD, its root zone
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, I mean, there are so many
things that, that are contributing I think
[SPEAKER_04]: to, even like water deprivation,
like if, there's so many things I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that allow these things to go in different
directions during the cultivation aspect
[SPEAKER_04]: of things that I think we've yet to really
truly understand in terms of controlling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this speaks to the point Colin,
that I was mentioning earlier to Nick,
[SPEAKER_01]: like when you walk through the grow,
you're not heating those terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 200 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're walking through the grow,
and basically getting a room temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, inhalation of, and when you
pinch the bud, you're not sending it
[SPEAKER_01]: through a injection port at 200 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think just my point to Nick before
was, while we conveniently use GC,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can change the parameters around
what temperatures these things are heated
[SPEAKER_01]: up, they're still being heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you stare cross-eyed at these
molecules, they, they do chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly when you, when you inject
something into an injection port,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how hot it is, it is going to
change the chemistry somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, Nick, just to go back to that
point for a second, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's look at terpenolene.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, terpenolene is a great
example because an isomer of terpenolene
[SPEAKER_01]: is limonene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in terpenolene, can there be
like four different isomers because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's two double bonds that could walk
around in that ring structure itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I think whether you're looking at
gamma terpenolene or whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at alpha terpenolene or whether
you're looking at limonene, these things
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to have very, very different
organoleptic properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, and that's, that's, and it depends
very much on the compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's, that's kind of the point
is that as I was mentioning about
[SPEAKER_03]: pharnassine earlier as an example,
I know that one and like those all present
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much the same way in, in terms of
the aroma bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not to say that each individually
would not present differently,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when they all come out together and
they bind to the same receptors,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole moiety is giving you that
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may be the case with say,
terpenolene and its various isomers that
[SPEAKER_03]: they pretty much will elute together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's, and then I use elute together
as meaning they're going to flash off
[SPEAKER_03]: together and we're going to smell them all
at the same time rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: independently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I want to caution that,
you know, with sensory and organoleptic
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches, reductionism is a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you try to just do a simple PCA or
principal component analysis of something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, you're just like, I think what
Kelly, other things that are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of what my program, well,
my approach to this is, is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's actually get a whole bunch more
buckets because we don't just want to use
[SPEAKER_03]: PCA because it, it, it really dulls the
colors and narrows the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ability to talk about things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to look at really as much as,
as much specificity as we can reasonably
[SPEAKER_03]: get, and we can try to get it to the,
the different use conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So vaporization, you know, straight up
smoking edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's, that's, and we're talking
about the gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, and the gut ECS, that's an
entirely different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't want to just over-reduce it
down to single compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one compound, one effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I mean, the, the FDA and the whole
drug classification has proven that that
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't work right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just kind of need to put in the
work to get as much information as you
[SPEAKER_03]: can, and then run analyses on these
databases against, you know, sensory
[SPEAKER_03]: against, you know, GC chemistry and LC
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, whatever other metrics
you want to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes work and it takes buy-in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the value we get from that does not
just only allow us to discuss and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and perhaps better characterize individual
lots of, of, of cannabis, but also allows
[SPEAKER_03]: growers to have information as to what
their particular treatment of a given
[SPEAKER_03]: strain is doing to the terpene and to the,
the, the actual chemovar expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an incredibly powerful tool the
value of which is almost impossible to
[SPEAKER_03]: quantify until you start playing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like, so like, you know,
there's a lot of, I mean, in growing,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh my God, there's so much bro science
about like, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 48 hours of light deprivation to increase
the THC and, you know, using the different
[SPEAKER_03]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the whole flushing
argument, you know, it's all anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is, absolute value in,
in anecdotal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But until you begin to really rigorously
try to understand why these things are
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, there's a lot of noise and the
signal gets lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I'm trying to do is more in
proposing is basically let's work on a
[SPEAKER_03]: system where we try to collect as much
information as we can and assemble it into
[SPEAKER_03]: a database that will allow us to start
statistically answering some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, it'll be a while,
but it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this isn't necessarily, it doesn't
matter if it takes forever, because we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to constantly be learning more
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also constantly going to be
refining our understanding of what
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds and what compounds in synergy or
antagonism do to our experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's, that's kind of the long and
the short of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is a, this is a, this is a
marathon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not a sprint.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark, I got a question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it would make more sense to
refer to the terpenes themselves as VOCs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, they're definitely
volatile, but yeah, so VOC is an acronym
[SPEAKER_01]: for volatile organic compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they certainly fall into that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, you know, again, like I've run
into this a few times where people want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call karyophylline, which is a
sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to call it a cannabinoid because
it binds to CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, you don't classify compounds by
what receptors they bind to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You classify them by what the structure of
the compound is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd always like to think that
cannabinoids are cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids are terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's interesting,
Addison, because if you looked at like
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles, like when you guys first
started way back when, and now,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you're getting a pretty broad swath
of terpene, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the most common ones in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this is again, more of a
question for Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still seems like there's an unknown
fraction of compounds in the volatile
[SPEAKER_01]: organic compound collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we still can't quite put our finger
on because if the folks at True Terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: try to create the sour diesel terpene
profile so they can put it in a jar and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it, it all, it all, to me anyway,
my sense tells me that those things all
[SPEAKER_01]: basically taste the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of missing the point that
they're only looking at maybe a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes and terpenoids that are in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what really makes a big impact are all
those compounds that are in there at such
[SPEAKER_01]: a low level that we can't really discern
them by GC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but our olfactory spectroscopy up
here can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an interesting thing that you
mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the GC settings are kind of what
determine that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no such thing as bad weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is only inadequate clothing and
preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, to quote Mr. Swanson,
the same thing is that there's nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: that's, it's not that we can't detect
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that we don't know we should be
looking for those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to work on changing the
resolution of your scan, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as an example, so I put in the chat,
you know, we're talking about terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenoids, monoterpenes, espiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's mentioned aliphatic alcohols,
dials, diolates, esters, or the acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, and this, for example,
there was this paper that came out like
[SPEAKER_03]: two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised it even got published
because they said, oh, we discovered what
[SPEAKER_03]: the skunky aroma was in cannabis for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, you've, I mean, we've known that
in beer for decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: We discovered the, we discovered the
garlic and onion characteristics and the
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, we know what compounds cause
those and what classes of compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you might have identified a
particular isomer of one or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but this is, this is information
that's already known.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we talk about terpenes,
like, I want people to move away from just
[SPEAKER_03]: using terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Marcus's point that people are getting
more excited about using the terms that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're learning because they want to dive
deeper and they want to be able to better
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the medicine or the compounds
or the material that they're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this conversation is really just to
get people started on, let's throw that
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, let's, let's, let's blow
this up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's zoom in and let's really blow this
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, let's create a really complex
system that we can at least use to derive
[SPEAKER_03]: information from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from the past life, you know,
that, that comparison between Mosaic and
[SPEAKER_03]: Sabra that I said earlier, well,
we narrowed it down to a compound that was
[SPEAKER_03]: at, at 0.0001 parts per trillion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can get pretty damn specific in
terms of the volume that's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, that's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, that resolution, like we kind
of went on a totally diversion bug hunt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a picogram?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what that is?
[SPEAKER_10]: A picogram?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might even be smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: So picot trillion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: One part per quadrillion?
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.1 parts per quadrillion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm taking a lint brush to a
New York city sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was thinking earlier too,
just about, you know, my favorite part of
[SPEAKER_10]: all of it is esters.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love like the banana ester is my
favorite because it's so complex in a
[SPEAKER_10]: sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, so it's, but what I love and
then look at CBD when you buy whatever the
[SPEAKER_10]: cherry flavor to CBD that binds to that
cannabinoid, there there's things in
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I always tell people is when you
smell cannabis, you're smelling a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: other things beside, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We know there's chlorophyll in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know there's plant matter there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other things that they're catching
the scent of.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why, when I look at the guys at
true terpenes, I feel like they aren't
[SPEAKER_10]: doing it correctly because they're not
adding some of those other things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, it's not going to be a
beautiful, clear jar of terpenes at that
[SPEAKER_10]: point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really, it always gets to me
where, you know, when I look at these
[SPEAKER_10]: things and I see the conversation,
it's the education level of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like Marcus said, they've gotten much
better.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they like, I remember when you,
when, when you use the term Terps or
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes, people had no idea what the fuck
that was.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would drive my car's license plates as
Terp rig and I would drive my car around
[SPEAKER_10]: and no one knew what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm in LA almost every time I'm on
the highway, there's kids behind me like
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking videoing my car because they,
because it's so popular now in the
[SPEAKER_10]: understanding that people know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that's the, the door's open.
[SPEAKER_10]: We cracked it a little bit and now they're
like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a lot of people don't know that
Maryland's college football team is the
[SPEAKER_10]: Terps, the Terpens.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they make a ton, I have t-shirts that
just say Terps on them and all this shit
[SPEAKER_10]: from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how it's becoming more of the
conversation, but the, the, and I,
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think the idea that, that you're
presenting Nick is genius because it will
[SPEAKER_10]: allow people at least something to measure
from at least something to dig into and
[SPEAKER_10]: compare, because that's what we're doing
all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We may agree here, but then turn around
and be in another situation and we're just
[SPEAKER_10]: comparing our own understanding.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, I'm excited to see really where
it goes because the love your point about
[SPEAKER_10]: the dropdown menu.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you get into it, it could be a
million different things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of fall into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, I think that when it comes to
analyzing things and looking at things and
[SPEAKER_10]: getting a better understanding of them,
it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like in order to get there,
we all need to smoke more hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just what it comes down and grow
more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there, there is a lot of studies
done with enzymatic biotransformation for,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, specifically targeting and
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll, I'll send you some white papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have digging into, and I think it will
be perhaps helpful for your brother,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the head space that you're occupying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The promise that was never really
delivered on is the notion that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: categorize a variety or cultivar by just
looking at the terpene profile by GC and
[SPEAKER_01]: then reassembling that terpene profile,
adding that to unflavored distillate and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically coming up with a good tasting
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, Addison, I, you know,
we've been following this thing for years
[SPEAKER_01]: and I still don't think that anyone has
got that, got that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always seems to me like there's two
aspects, not just the terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the relative concentration of
terpenes, you know, like so sensitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, years ago, when Tony was talking
about, you know, adding terpenes to his
[SPEAKER_01]: dad, he was like putting squirts of it in
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can still feel it on my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add that much, it becomes,
yeah, caustic on your throat.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it also, it gets to the full circle of
why Kylie is here today.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, because a part of this
conversation and creating a shared
[SPEAKER_15]: lexicon, it's also like, well,
you can't be smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say when you consume hash
or a vape and depending on what
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature you're using, and also if you
consume in the flower form, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to have a totally different experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the flower form, you're going to
be getting a lot of other compounds for
[SPEAKER_03]: good or for ill that are, you know,
present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you get the ash, the ash and the
smoke and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, sorry, Marcus, we lost you just
at the, as you're getting into the
[SPEAKER_03]: excitement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, that's, that's a huge
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I call that form or the format
matters hugely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know this is hash church.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe flower is verboten, but it's,
you know, there's some strains that I
[SPEAKER_03]: prefer to consume in flower form just
because I enjoy the experience I get from
[SPEAKER_03]: it and others that I, you know,
really don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, gorilla glue and nine
pound hammer and all those guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are not lightly named.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for me, I'm, I'm, I'm very sensitive
to THC and it just knocks me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like this is the one I just showed
earlier with a bunch of CBG and CBD and CB
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also got 3% CBC and 0.4% CBT,
which is super interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been, I've been chasing these
cannabinoids for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is someone I'm talking to about
some of their, their, their development.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, we had a, I had another one
that was a 1.5 CBC and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and most, mostly Varennes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, it made me feel like I was
consuming it, you know, back in high
[SPEAKER_03]: school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was giggly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was energetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was super happy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was a CBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went out and got another one that had
the highest, the highest level CBC,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it makes me feel completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's, I suspect that that one is
probably had to do with the terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just psyched as hell because,
well, first of all, I love that feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the sort of kind of got off on a
tangent here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonder why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, the, the experience was just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to try to get that
characterized, at least in terms of what,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least personally for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me be completely honest,
I'm a little bit selfish in pursuing this
[SPEAKER_03]: because I want to know how this all stuff,
this stuff works.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I want to know what I feel like.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a, he's wanting pets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just, I mean, just for
ourselves, I think this is a, this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: really great opportunity for just for the,
for the geeks to geek out on what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: really interested in, you know,
and expands.
[SPEAKER_11]: One second.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you saying your dog wanted petting?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a unique situation in
science.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is anybody aware of the dog wanting pets?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've never, never, never heard of that
before.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I run that through the GC.
[SPEAKER_03]: His GC is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a canine lexicon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strange affinity for, for cat dung though.
[SPEAKER_15]: I too, I had the kitty litter robot,
my cat, my dog.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a good scene.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: That likes to eat the other dog's stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've done everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's just, you know, and,
and, you know, some days she doesn't get
[SPEAKER_10]: me kisses.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Free snacks out the oven.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's a very taboo thing to witness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Raspberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or vanilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anal gland of a water rodent.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I wanted to bring up was
toxicology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I believe at least that that's
a, another subject that is highly under
[SPEAKER_04]: looked in terms of how we're stacking,
you know, things through action,
[SPEAKER_04]: taking these individual parent parts and
then creating new formulations with them
[SPEAKER_04]: as ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're entering a new world that,
you know, admittedly, I don't think we,
[SPEAKER_04]: we really truly understand fully yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's, I just believe there's
that should be a long for the,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to develop, you know,
a language, it should be baked into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all understand that the risk behind
a lot of this is, is actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we love making these amazing
products, but through that act,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just believe that we've also
made some pretty toxic things,
[SPEAKER_04]: full of gun, pretty toxic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's certain things that
we're going to start to have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: answers for, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think there's a, it is a,
it is a drug, you know, there's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be risks and toxic, you know, the toxicity
of that drug.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel like the one great thing about
cannabis is that it seems to be not very
[SPEAKER_10]: toxic at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, unless you have this hypermesis
or these other issues with consumption.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's so great about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I, I mean, at the end, we all get these
questions all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a question the other day from a guy
who obviously has no understanding of,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a very, very quick early
understanding.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he did some research on leukemia
and saw that there are cell types for
[SPEAKER_10]: leukemia, which specific cannabinoids and
terpene profiles work really well for.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and then that sort of led him into
this direction of being like, well,
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, my grandmother's not eating,
so I'm trying to get her to eat.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, I explained to him, I said,
just give her a very low dose of THC,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, cause we all know when we were
kids and we smoked that shitty brown weed,
[SPEAKER_10]: we were, we got the munchies super hard
because the dose of THC was so low.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we also know too, if you take a,
you know, if you put to face a a half
[SPEAKER_10]: grand dab, you're probably not going to be
eating anything anytime soon after that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I explained to him, Hey, look,
you know, give her a really low dose of
[SPEAKER_10]: THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's like, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, have her take one puff off
of a joint, you know, see what grandma's
[SPEAKER_10]: made of, you know, check her out,
see what she can do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and he's like, well, I mean,
you know, we don't want her to feel the
[SPEAKER_10]: effects of, of the THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, well, listen, you're not
going to get the hungry feeling without
[SPEAKER_10]: the psychoactive feeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: They come together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, but ask your grandmother this,
what medications are she taking right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: And what are the side effects of that
medication?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you kind of educate them to a point
where they start to understand more like,
[SPEAKER_10]: look, man, you're going to fucking break,
you know, you're going to break some eggs
[SPEAKER_10]: if you're making omelets, grandma.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he came back to me this morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: He messaged me and he said, man,
he said, you know, she got to the point
[SPEAKER_10]: where she, you know, wasn't eating and my
mother came to me and we had to make
[SPEAKER_10]: something happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I told him about our conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was smoking a joint and she came up
and took one puff off the joint and lo and
[SPEAKER_10]: behold, she takes one puff off the joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: Her first response is I don't feel
anything, you know, which is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe.
[SPEAKER_10]: 25 minutes later, he said she was sitting
down eating soup, which she hadn't had the
[SPEAKER_10]: urge to do before.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it really, to me, it's like,
how do you introduce them?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you walk them in real slightly and
give them that understanding?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what this is about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about really creating a measure so
that people can say, hey, because look
[SPEAKER_10]: what we've already all done collectively.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've all collectively helped deliver some
of this stuff that they're already looking
[SPEAKER_10]: at.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these, you know, when Steep Hill
did its terpene testing, we were all
[SPEAKER_10]: sitting there and it was like,
oh, we're going to be able to identify all
[SPEAKER_10]: these fucking things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, no, you just open Pandora's
box.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you put your foot in your mouth at the
same time, because nature, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: God is nature in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like nature is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my biggest beef with Steep Hill is
that you are not the science of,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, you are not the they try to
claim to be this like.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it like the science of cannabis or
something?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, no, nature is that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nature is giving this to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just analyzing and looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just, you know, you're you're
you're business people looking at these
[SPEAKER_10]: things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you said that, Addison,
because I think that it's really important
[SPEAKER_09]: for us to remember, too, that while we're
studying terpenes and all of all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: different fractals off of what terpenes
are and what they can be even combined
[SPEAKER_09]: with and be created from, you know,
the cannabis plant is creating terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a live state, it's creating terpenes
through this incredible dynamic
[SPEAKER_09]: microbiology body, which is the
microbiome, which is the endophytic system
[SPEAKER_09]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, talk about nature and talk
about trying to explain something that is
[SPEAKER_09]: so dynamically happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what soil are you giving it?
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of lights do you have?
[SPEAKER_09]: All of these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm going to go back to and I'm
going to go back to this awesome example.
[SPEAKER_09]: And science is that us as well as plants,
our DNA, we're ninety nine point nine
[SPEAKER_09]: percent identical.
[SPEAKER_09]: But our microbiome, we're ninety nine
point nine percent totally different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's no different with the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we are trying to explain and
express.
[SPEAKER_09]: While I do think that this kind of common
language could be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in making medicines,
I believe that a lot of the energy and
[SPEAKER_09]: effort and unfolding, if you will,
of the plant really needs to come from
[SPEAKER_09]: that endophytic system and microbiology
and how we are creating the terpenes from
[SPEAKER_09]: the very beginning, not necessarily how
we're separating them out and how we're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to, you know, isolate them and
create new sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But how are we going to work with the
plant in its natural state to create these
[SPEAKER_09]: vast amounts of terpenes and and what are
we feeding the soil that creates these
[SPEAKER_09]: these terpenes?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what is so incredibly interesting
to me and the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's where all of this
intersects with metabolomics and
[SPEAKER_03]: proteomics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can actually take samples throughout
the life cycle of a plant and look at what
[SPEAKER_03]: genes are being turned off and on and what
what metabolic pathways are engaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's super exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's obviously you need to
get the sort of the first data down and
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is it's some amazing science that
has become accessible in the last couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of years to be able to look into the plant
cells and see what the reaction of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant is to a given environment in terms
of its tertiary metabolites and secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolites, what it's producing and look
at, you know, what the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical impact in the living organism of
a environmental change or stressor is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that will take even more work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, as I said, this is a,
you know, if we get this going,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's certainly job security because it's a
very long experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's super, super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually and this is one of the
things that I kind of want to point out is
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, this type of work has
implications beyond just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this can be as you talked about
toxicology, but look in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutic benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this the sense of smell is so
important in memories that I suspect that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is probably a way to use sense and
condition in combination with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: other therapy to help people overcome
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they associate this smell with
this particular traumatic event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's start introducing some other
smells to try to just change the signal
[SPEAKER_03]: noise ratio on on on their disorder,
even dementia.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you look at dementia,
that it's I've had that idea as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to interrupt, but it makes me think
that, too, because you what I've noticed
[SPEAKER_10]: just in some of the research I've been
look, you know, just in videos I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: watching and things that I'm looking at of
these Alzheimer's patients, they're using
[SPEAKER_10]: music to to reintroduce them to different
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And instantly I was like, well,
fuck, that'd be great if you also had them
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, if you would speak to them or
talk to the family members that they had
[SPEAKER_10]: and bring, you know, maybe they were a
gardener and they love to grow lavender.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you introduce lavender with the
music and see what that stimulates.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's it's opening up a lot of
different doors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to jump off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just leave you guys with one last
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: When we were when we were preparing for
Legends, Marcus had explained to us that
[SPEAKER_10]: we wanted to make sure that we had to have
fruits and stuff at the event.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were dealing with the company called
Sassoon Fruits, which sent us a box of
[SPEAKER_10]: fruit to check out just to kind of figure
out what we wanted to get.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they sent us these pineapple guavas,
which are these little green pineapple
[SPEAKER_10]: guavas.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're tiny little things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are also other guavas.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a bunch of great stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what they are, but the
terpium profile on those things,
[SPEAKER_10]: if there's ever a strain of cannabis like
that, it's going to take over the fucking
[SPEAKER_10]: world.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is so crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to analyze this and just see
what they are, because they're when you
[SPEAKER_10]: taste it, you're getting, you know,
it's touching on some of the things that
[SPEAKER_10]: we've experienced that we understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then there's a whole other however
they're binding, however they're together.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's such a wide range of terpium flavor
that's in it that you can taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got to jump off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave you guys with that because it
was those pineapple guavas.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to find them.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to try them and then let me know
what you think, because it was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to go get a Christmas tree
so we could have some terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_10]: house.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to thank everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for having me, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you have a great Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you sign off, you can grow those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you live near L.A.?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you a link right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are super easy to grow and they
are fejoas.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant is the Latin name and the common
name in Brazil is called a fejo.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow really well, pretty much from
any zone above 7b.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are you guys are perfect for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, pineapple guava is a great way
to describe the character.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hit up Reggie and I'm going
to be like, Reggie, we need to isolate
[SPEAKER_10]: these and then let's see if we can put
these things in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you described as that guava and that
pineapple character, those are a ton of
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy things together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's interesting about pineapple is
that if you just change the OH group on
[SPEAKER_03]: its location, it tastes like strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they were able to breed
something called the pine berry,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a strawberry that tastes like
pineapple and it's white.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like, yeah, totally growable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love fejoas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're one of my favorite fruits.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just hard to find.
[SPEAKER_15]: So why does it not surprise me that you
even know what the fuck he was talking
[SPEAKER_15]: about?
[SPEAKER_15]: And you I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just laughing.
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's talk about legends next next
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_15]: Addison will for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll definitely love to jump in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to say that yesterday we
successfully were able to grab the domains
[SPEAKER_10]: for legends.
[SPEAKER_10]: So me and Marcus have been discussing
stuff and it looks like we'll be moving
[SPEAKER_10]: forward with some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So soon there'll be a website soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: The T-shirts and the past lanyard T-shirts
will be available and all these really
[SPEAKER_10]: cool things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't thank you enough for believing in
us and giving us the opportunity to put
[SPEAKER_10]: legends on.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we hope we did you proud.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: You absolutely did it proud.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to talk about it hopefully
next week because lots of people are
[SPEAKER_15]: asking questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: So love to have a little hour talk about
legends next week.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll see you guys next week.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Peace out, Addison.
[SPEAKER_11]: But also going on what Addison was saying,
I would also then add on, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: psilocybin therapy on there because of how
psilocybin are able to re-bridge neurons.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's something that isn't
discussed enough as well, especially for
[SPEAKER_11]: people who are older or have suffered
traumas.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you were talking, Nick, earlier about
that, that's one of the things we found.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I work with veterans at a
national and international level.
[SPEAKER_11]: And cannabis is an amazing palliative.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when, you know, you want to deal when
that healer that that deeper healing,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, psychedelics come into play.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the the new forefront
that they're experimenting with in
[SPEAKER_11]: psilocybin, because I think a combination
of cannabis and psilocybin are going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: natural beneficials.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're seeing that already in the
veterans community from people already
[SPEAKER_11]: self-healing that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just trying to come up with
standard operational procedures so people
[SPEAKER_11]: can have a safe and efficacious experience
as opposed to, you know, they get the
[SPEAKER_11]: experience they want as opposed to the
experience they're given.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because those are set in settings are,
as you know, are are key to any type of
[SPEAKER_11]: acceptance or unacceptance.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if I go take mushrooms and go to
an amusement park, I'm going to have a
[SPEAKER_11]: different experience than if I'm in my
home where I have things that I can relate
[SPEAKER_11]: to that ground to me, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: It allows for that self-healing to take
place.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a a total holistic understanding
that I think is lost on a lot,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially younger people when they're out
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're experimenting.
[SPEAKER_11]: They take these and then go out into the
world as opposed to trying to go as best
[SPEAKER_11]: as we can inward to the situation,
which is a whole other level of education
[SPEAKER_11]: that needs to take place.
[SPEAKER_11]: But just that correlation between,
you know, people with Alzheimer's and
[SPEAKER_11]: those that are having memory issues.
[SPEAKER_11]: And especially as you get into that
dementia range, I look forward to seeing
[SPEAKER_11]: and especially if there is some budding
researchers out there, we look forward to
[SPEAKER_11]: seeing your studies once you become
doctors on what actually takes place in
[SPEAKER_11]: these relationships, because we definitely
need to have a better understanding,
[SPEAKER_11]: because we know anecdotally it's
happening, but we need the science like
[SPEAKER_11]: with cannabis to come around and actually,
you know, bring bring that to the case.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I love what you're doing, Nick,
and keep at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's trying to build the support for
it all, because I think it's it's got a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of potential in terms of what you're
just mentioning about psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also venture ketamine therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dr. Sunil Agarwal is now suing the DEA
to make psilocybin legal for medical
[SPEAKER_03]: treatments because it's demonstrated
efficacy and they can't, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't regulate, you can't prevent
people getting access to something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the therapy, like I have actually
undergone some of this therapy and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendously impactful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just for trauma and depression and
stuff like that, but also for something
[SPEAKER_03]: like migraines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So psilocybin is a fantastic anti-migraine
medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's surprising, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a whole other frontier.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, we're still having problems
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, still, I mean, this week,
a group I work with at the UN level,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we had to set out a letter and we
were able to get over 100 groups to call
[SPEAKER_11]: for greater transparency at the ANCB with
its cannabis initiative because they're
[SPEAKER_11]: being behind closed doors.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we put the pressure and got a response
this week from the UN secretary general
[SPEAKER_11]: where they want to hear from us,
but they will not mediate the discussion.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to take a whole bunch of
information.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got things coming up this week in
Vienna and then in mid-March we'll be
[SPEAKER_11]: there as well trying to push back against
this because we're just celebrating one
[SPEAKER_11]: year, just one year, people.
[SPEAKER_11]: As of December 2nd, the group that I work
with changed international law and got
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis pulled out of schedule four so
that medical marijuana is legal for the
[SPEAKER_11]: first year since 1961.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're currently working on getting
cannabis pulled for recreational and adult
[SPEAKER_11]: use as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, we're still treading
these waters.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got a long way to go
international wise, but treaty wise.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we get this research that you're
doing, Nick, and get it going,
[SPEAKER_11]: hopefully by the time we all, we'll
hopefully all meet on a path sometime in
[SPEAKER_11]: the future where we'll find the utopia
we're searching for education and freedom
[SPEAKER_11]: wise.
[SPEAKER_11]: So steps by steps.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're on that path right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on that yellow brick road.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of work being done in Canada
with the Canadian Psychedelic Association
[SPEAKER_13]: and a lot of the psychedelic therapy
that's happened in Canada has crossed over
[SPEAKER_13]: to the US and the term psychedelic was
coined by a Canadian doctor.
[SPEAKER_13]: I forget his name right off the top of my
head, but I think it was in 1955 back in
[SPEAKER_13]: Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_13]: They were doing LSD trials and doing some
pretty incredible therapies with
[SPEAKER_13]: addictions back in the 50s.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was LSD going into the public that
you always hear about it changing the
[SPEAKER_13]: paradigm and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we feel like we're coming back
towards therapy, but the issue that we
[SPEAKER_13]: will need to address is as we open up the
therapies is to not as it gets legalized
[SPEAKER_13]: is to not have it be overregulated like it
is with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it's, it's obvious that
plant medicine is therapy that helps us
[SPEAKER_13]: through things.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause we've been guided through plant
medicine with indigenous cultures
[SPEAKER_13]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: And in some cases, people continue to go
back to these indigenous tribes and get
[SPEAKER_13]: therapy, but plant medicine therapies in
general are on the rise.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it comes to psychedelics,
there's literally thousands of compounds
[SPEAKER_13]: out there that help, you know,
unlock the mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it comes to cognitive
degradation, you know, breaking the
[SPEAKER_13]: finding ways to get to the, through the
blood brain barrier, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: to be able to nourish the brain are the
medicines that we need to focus on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where, you know, whole,
whole soil, whole plant food, whole
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine comes in because it's often Al
Hubbard.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's often those medicines that truly know
how to break through the blood brain
[SPEAKER_13]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there, and, you know, things like rock
account and algae together has been proven
[SPEAKER_13]: to improve cognitive degradation and also
medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many good medicinal mushroom
studies out there are often in Korean,
[SPEAKER_13]: Russian, or Chinese or Japanese.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't often get those teachings in,
in this, in this Western culture,
[SPEAKER_13]: but, but it's these new awakenings that
we're going through right now that will
[SPEAKER_13]: help unlock people.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we believe in this, you know,
medical sovereignty and this medical,
[SPEAKER_13]: this choice of, of what medicines that
you, you deserve to have to treat your
[SPEAKER_13]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now PTSD comes in lots of forms
because we have lockdowns and mandates out
[SPEAKER_13]: there that are creating PTSD, which people
could use plant medicine to get through.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, big love to the families
like, like yourself, ATM, which are
[SPEAKER_13]: helping international law.
[SPEAKER_13]: We really applaud you and really want to
be here to support you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And often, and also we just want to help
people, you know, keep it sacred as it
[SPEAKER_13]: moves forward.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it's that sacred.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the sanctity that really speaks to
our cellular evolution and our cellular
[SPEAKER_13]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it's a trying to stay
natural, but using these other methods to
[SPEAKER_13]: enhance it, you know, I think is going to
be what brings us towards longevity.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate the dynamic conversation
and each person's, you know, expertise in
[SPEAKER_13]: the field, you know, makes, makes it a
whole conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have somewhere I kind of want to
shift the conversation towards our good
[SPEAKER_15]: friend, Wade, who's in the room.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just been hanging out.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to first say welcome brother.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that you're hurting right now with
the ribs and that would be nice for
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone to give Wade a little bit of love
as he's, you know, in at home right now,
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of in bed with some, with some damage
to his body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're thinking about you brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wait here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what happened, Mark is, uh,
back in September, um, I fractured a rib
[SPEAKER_00]: on my right side and, um, I, I did it
climbing out of bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't fall down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing, no reason that's apparent for
that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but went to the hospital and got
X-rays and sure enough, fractured a rib
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, in conversation with my doctor,
we both agreed that seemed very odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, and so yeah, series of blood tests
revealed that I am profoundly,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, deficient in vitamin D three.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a farmer who spends hours each day
outside, I eat really good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay attention to the things that I
expose myself to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use cannabis on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm a person who should be
enjoying good health, but in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've talked with my doctor and done a
little research, vitamin D three
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency does not happen suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been going on for years for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably why I hurt my back back in
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the moment, yeah, I am,
I'm getting on two weeks pretty much in
[SPEAKER_00]: bed because not only do I have the one
fractured rib, but there's a chiropractor
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been to see me is of the opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of fractured ribs on the
other side of my rib cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, a couple of ribs that are
dislocated, just having a grand old time
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I know what's going on,
the fact that I'm so deficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually I'm deficient enough in vitamin D
three that if I were a child, I would be
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosed with rickets, which is a really
horrible disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, much thanks and appreciation
for Monica, my partner, who is working her
[SPEAKER_00]: fanny off to keep up with my needs,
as well as the farm and everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emotionally and mentally, I feel inspired
and deeply grateful again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's been a lot of things
going on in my life over the last five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six years that I had trouble understanding
why I was experiencing those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I know that I'm deficient in
vitamin D three, I'm taking extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: large doses of it, large enough that they
are prescription only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a good doctor who's helping
me with dealing with the issues that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to many more years of
being an obnoxious and pressing sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: guy because I feel my health coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that when my mind and my heart
are inspired, my body will catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, yeah, I've got my camera
turned off because you don't want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what I look like laying here in bed going
on two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get a shower this morning for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, things are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite honestly, for the last couple of
weeks, I have not been able to sit,
[SPEAKER_00]: stand or walk without a great deal of
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm mostly resting in bed and
eating well and taking care of myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: healing and feeling deeply grateful for
such a lovely and amazing woman as a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of all I got at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very much am enjoying the conversation
about terpenes and learning more deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemistry of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But much like Kelly, I got to keep
pointing back to this plant knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel cautious about trying to cut up
all the different compounds that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we can put them back
together again in a way that provides
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially the same benefit that the
plant does all by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to learn what we
can about this plant because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: question it's a huge gift to our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's kind of all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging in I'm loving the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate Marcus, you putting on the
church this morning and the usual crew
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows up and some of the new faces
and you're an inspiration, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will look forward to many more years
of being inspired and hopefully once in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while inspiring somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_15]: Always.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time you share, bro, you're
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate the kind words.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there's anything the church
community that has church community can do
[SPEAKER_15]: to help to help you out, like,
you know, don't hesitate to reach out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us know what we can do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Wade, sorry, we're going to miss you
at the Emerald Cup next week, but,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, heal well quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to the time when we can
embrace again, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really looking forward to it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four months ago, a couple of months ago,
I thought, hell, I don't see any way out
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what's happening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels like my body's falling apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, yeah, it was falling
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there other symptoms or other
indicators that would lead you to believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have a vitamin D deficiency
before you actually start breaking bones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than, like, feeling like my teeth
have gotten soft over the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always somewhat puzzled at how I
hurt my back back in 2018, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing what seemed to be pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work that I've done with no problem for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet that year, it turned into a
nightmare that resulted in having to have
[SPEAKER_00]: surgery and spending some time in the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came out of that feeling pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no, is the short answer to your
question, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really brought it home was a blood
serum analysis that revealed that my blood
[SPEAKER_00]: level content of vitamin D3 was eight
nanograms per milliliter of serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normal is somewhere between 40 and
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like I said, I don't know why
I've gotten so deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to get my bones strong
again and build up the vitamin D level in
[SPEAKER_00]: my bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also, the next step after that is to
understand why did I become so
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically deficient in a vitamin that
my body should be making with my exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sun and the diet that I pursue?
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat lots of vegetables that we grow
right here on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat fruit from the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to call it out, but I eat meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy high quality organic meats and we
don't eat it that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just feel like, yeah, I was doing
everything I knew how to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet somehow ended up profoundly
deficient in vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess one of the things I would say
to everybody that's listening is trust
[SPEAKER_00]: your doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn what they can offer to you in the
way of information that is available about
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pay attention to what's happening
to your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting to be 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I feel like I got years of
trouble making left and look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: having my body back and ready to rock and
roll.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we appreciate you, Wade,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it really does speak to kind of like
the whole conversation that we've been
[SPEAKER_15]: talking about today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trying to create the shared lexicon and
going down the sensory rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's to do things like the blood serum
test that you got done.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it's for.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's to learn things that we can't learn
and know from things that have been passed
[SPEAKER_15]: down necessarily from our grandmothers or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are certain things that we can't
just assume.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we go to science and we get that
blood serum test and we get told you have
[SPEAKER_15]: this deficiency.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's really kind of a full circle to
the story.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really hope you're feeling better,
Wade.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to welcome Dr. Allison.
[SPEAKER_15]: How the heck are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have a post-it here from a
client that I have been waiting to see,
[SPEAKER_08]: Wade, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wade, can you give me a recommendation
for an indica-leaning CBD, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harlequin was an indica-leaning mix of
indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A high CBD version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to Harley Sue or ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dozens and dozens and dozens of
different cultivars that are out there
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I bet Etienne would be a better
person to answer that question because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's seeing what's available in the
California marketplace through the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's heritage market,
if you will, what was happening a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I bet Etienne would have a good
suggestion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade, I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is, unfortunately,
is we are not seeing CBD cultivars showing
[SPEAKER_11]: up at the dispensaries nowadays.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're seeing all the bastard stepchildren,
but we're not seeing any CBD dominance
[SPEAKER_11]: lately.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure if it's from the grow
supply or manufacturing, but we are
[SPEAKER_11]: deficient here in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: So growers, manufacturers, please,
we need to do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Etienne, are we allowed to ship stuff to
California?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's still illegal because it's still
federal mail.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it has to be in California by
California to Californians, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_11]: until, of course, as we know, the
interstate commerce discussion is gaining
[SPEAKER_11]: more traction now more than ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are letters that are being put
forth to push more for that because I want
[SPEAKER_11]: to be able to benefit from other people as
well as I want to be able to send people,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, genetics and things like that,
because there will be a time here in the
[SPEAKER_11]: future when you can say, yes, I want to
order a Harlequin specific.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need these many genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, I want to be able to do so here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately, we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, right now, currently,
we've got two competitions opening
[SPEAKER_11]: California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Emerald Cup is accepting for its 2022
competition.
[SPEAKER_11]: And currently, I'm the ambassador for the
state of California for its actually
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis competition for the state fair
because it's not actually at a county
[SPEAKER_11]: level working its way up to state yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is CBD flower is part of the both
of those competitions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very much looking forward here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we won't see the competition from
Emerald Cup until next year as judges,
[SPEAKER_11]: because now it's waiting until the harvest
comes in and then going forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the unfortunate yet fortunate
things that happened due to covid is they
[SPEAKER_11]: prolonged the competition last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are able to get all the samples in
the spring so that we could actually get a
[SPEAKER_11]: true representation of the harvest that
happened here in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I'm hoping that we'll be able to
see some Harlequins and others place here
[SPEAKER_11]: at the state fair so that we can make
everybody aware, but also see the need for
[SPEAKER_11]: production and getting this genetic out
there to the market, because currently
[SPEAKER_11]: it's only for legal manufacturers in the
state of California.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, in the future, it's going to be
open to backyard growers, because here in
[SPEAKER_11]: California, any adult over the age of 21
can grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have to kind of wait for the county
situation to come on board.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're kind of leapfrogging initially
with the state to hopefully get the
[SPEAKER_11]: counties to come on board so that we can
have a true competition like you would in
[SPEAKER_11]: any natural state where it rises from the
county level then to the state level.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then at that point, wouldn't you love
to be able to then export or import any of
[SPEAKER_11]: these winners, losers, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because then as these competitions come on
board in your states and in your regions,
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be able to taste and sample or
grow that genetic of those particular
[SPEAKER_11]: winners to see what I can actually do the
best out of.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope that these competitions,
as they become larger, will also make
[SPEAKER_11]: people more understanding as a whole on
these CBD varietals and how beneficial
[SPEAKER_11]: they are, because daily I'm getting
patients who are asking and looking for
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, I recommend a saturation of
THC and CBD together to help them get an
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding for their own understanding
of what their own symbiosis of what their
[SPEAKER_11]: own natural feeling should be or be like.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, sorry, long-winded.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been doing a lot more
cannabis-assisted psychotherapy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why I was asking for a
CBD-leaning endocrine, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: these people have high amounts of anxiety,
but the anxiety is also for THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're terrified to touch THC,
but they hear out cannabis is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I've been looking for one so that
we can start out with a CBD and then
[SPEAKER_08]: slightly move them into a little bit of
THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: But having something that's a little more
on the relaxing side will allow for them
[SPEAKER_08]: to like open their heart and have some
vulnerability in the session.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we recommend starting off with
the teas, like for older women,
[SPEAKER_11]: like when my mother wanted to start trying
cannabis, she doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the things that we found is we
found certain teas and tea companies make
[SPEAKER_11]: varieties like a 20 to 1 CBD to 1 THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was a perfect way to introduce
her into trying it, because she got very
[SPEAKER_11]: little THC, but it felt very relaxed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that we have found
is especially CBD helps balance things
[SPEAKER_11]: out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I myself take a 2 to 1, 2 THC to 1 CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know some people prefer 1 to 1.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people can handle the 18 to 1,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's finding what your body has and
likes.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we start getting- I like 20 to 0.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what works for you and what ratio is
key.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I have a friend of mine who likes
to hang around stoners like Rob Clark,
[SPEAKER_11]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he says when he goes to hang out with
them, he'll take 60 milligrams of just CBD
[SPEAKER_11]: so that when he's hanging with these
experts, he can smoke all night and not
[SPEAKER_11]: get absolutely blitzed because he can hang
with them and not feel so anxious and
[SPEAKER_11]: paranoid because of the amount of CBD he
puts in his system.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's counteracting and balancing out that
effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's not actually getting that effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then finding then later just then small
spikes of terpene-rich cannabis then
[SPEAKER_11]: brings on the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, it's about finding your natural
biome.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it is very crucial with CBD
varietals, especially initially because of
[SPEAKER_11]: the anxiety and especially in a
therapeutic environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: When people are first experimenting with
cannabis, I myself have known when I've
[SPEAKER_11]: given somebody too much, it's easily to
make them go from absolutely happy and
[SPEAKER_11]: giddy and relaxed to absolutely paranoid
to a level of uncomfortableness that makes
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone around them uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so those are the things that we try to
avoid and why with my experimentation of
[SPEAKER_11]: working with patients over the decades
have found a blend of CHC, CBD in both low
[SPEAKER_11]: spikes are very helpful to introduce them
comfortably into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't mean that they're not gonna
have any type of negative reaction,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's as least as we can make the climb
in as possible, make the bed as warm as we
[SPEAKER_11]: can when we get into it on a cold night,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder if people were really paranoid
before the DEA started locking people up
[SPEAKER_15]: and giving them 20, 30 years at a time,
like infusing paranoia into cannabis the
[SPEAKER_15]: way the meat industry infuses the tortured
flesh and adrenaline soaked flesh out to
[SPEAKER_15]: the people.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're attacking the very thing that is
good for PTSD and relaxation and you're
[SPEAKER_15]: infusing it with paranoia.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you, law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does California assembly bill,
after the FDA denied the Charlotte Webb's
[SPEAKER_01]: petition or I'm sorry, whatever,
the Charlotte company denied the listing
[SPEAKER_01]: of it as a dietary supplement and then
California assembly bill which was passed
[SPEAKER_01]: in October now makes CBD available as a
dietary supplement in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think production will catch up
with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your original premise, which was,
I need to see this stuff in my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that'll change
production to put CBD leaning cultivars on
[SPEAKER_01]: the radar for producers in California?
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope I don't know that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: In the sense that, the legislation is
still not finished in the sense that I
[SPEAKER_11]: cannot still have CBD products in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I can now have Sativa derived CBD
varietals in the future in my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm already starting to get hit by CBD
distributors, manufacturers from the
[SPEAKER_11]: outside world that are the non cannabis
starting to dangle their foot into our
[SPEAKER_11]: reality.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am very hopeful that we are going to see
more people start to experiment and play
[SPEAKER_11]: with these varieties and start to break
out every type of ratio so that every type
[SPEAKER_11]: of ratio is available.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because unfortunately right now the only
way to do so is to isolate it,
[SPEAKER_11]: set it aside, et cetera, as opposed to
have every specific THC to CBD ratio
[SPEAKER_11]: available.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not available.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to see that available so that
people can then document and isolate what
[SPEAKER_11]: works for them individually.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm still getting people all the
time, especially people I went to high
[SPEAKER_11]: school with and grade school with are
like, hey, you're a cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me which CBD company out there is
right for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: How many times a day have you done that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I got no fucking clue and I'm
not going to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to bullshit you and tell you
something I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I can see science that backs it up,
et cetera, the only way I've seen that is
[SPEAKER_11]: the route that we have created here in
California.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see it through the distributors and
manufacturers at the cannabis level.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not see that at the professional
outside manufacturer level yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I anticipate it will in time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully, yes, I hope that more of
that access will cause that.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I still think there's a problem
with the CBD manufacturers currently in
[SPEAKER_11]: play just as CBD from the hemp because
they're not investing in the hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I hate that they're being so easy
on themselves by just cutting the flowers,
[SPEAKER_11]: by not putting in real infrastructure for
manufacturing, for the decortication,
[SPEAKER_11]: for actually making hemp into viable
products, much less foodstuffs,
[SPEAKER_11]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still don't have just that basic
understanding and we're still so far
[SPEAKER_11]: behind.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do hope that some of these CBD people
will step into the THC realm and some of
[SPEAKER_11]: these THC people will step into the CBD
realm so that we can get that biodiversity
[SPEAKER_11]: that's needed for the patients themselves
currently because it is sorely missing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so once that's there, I would like to
see that next step because then Allison
[SPEAKER_11]: has all these different ratios to strive
to try from starting from one end and
[SPEAKER_11]: working her way back or working your way
up, however, or whichever way in the
[SPEAKER_11]: spectrum you find yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or where your body is acclimated to or is
used to.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not understood.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that Wade has his hand up.
[SPEAKER_08]: An interesting aspect I do just wanna
throw out with regard to using cannabis as
[SPEAKER_08]: a therapy tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of want to push them to that line
of anxiety because when you push them to
[SPEAKER_08]: that line of anxiety during a therapy
session, then you can explore what it is
[SPEAKER_08]: that's causing that anxiety.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I love what you're saying,
Etienne, about being able to go from 20 to
[SPEAKER_08]: one to 10 to one to five to one and slowly
move them in that direction towards that
[SPEAKER_08]: increase of anxiety that really helps to,
it's what we work from as a therapist.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I saw Wade had his hand up,
so I'll retract.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you make an excellent point,
Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I'm not a big fan of pushing
people on their dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what drove me to raise my hand was
Etienne's observation about, I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a grandmother having a cup of tea as a
way of getting into cannabis without the
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with the fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we talk a lot about the
chemistry of the cannabis plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: various ways that chemistry might affect
people, but we don't talk very much about
[SPEAKER_00]: the different ways of getting that
chemistry into your body, the different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of preparing that chemistry into a
product that can be taken into the body or
[SPEAKER_00]: dose or frequency of use or any of those
other things, all of which play,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my experience at least, a huge part in
what you can benefit from by using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking or inhalation is one way to gain
benefit from the use of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the only way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way we talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way our culture sees cannabis
being consumed in the media and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I gotta be honest, other than my own
personal use and maybe one in 50 patients
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with over the years,
most people I've worked with don't wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke either because they're kids or
they're elders or they're people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: scared of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have found again and again,
by looking at the needs of that person and
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemistry of the plants in oils that I
might have on hand, I can usually find
[SPEAKER_00]: some way of preparing those oils that the
person will not only benefit from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but want to use it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then part of the education that I try
and do on dosing is help them to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to find the dose that works
for them, that they would be willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that dose to start building the
vitality and health of their
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the things that we talk about
everything from PTSD to neuralgia,
[SPEAKER_00]: to seizures, to cancer, all of these
various conditions and many more respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis because the endocannabinoid
system is involved in those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is about, for me,
not unlike tending the soil of your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly but surely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build the vitality, the diversity of
your garden soil, you'll see better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am laying in my bed talking
about diversity and building your health
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that, but it does work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's still, like you said, like Nick
said earlier, what are you gonna give up?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you gotta keep going.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's always gonna be about health and
wellbeing, even if you're currently still
[SPEAKER_13]: working towards that because I think we're
all working towards health and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, no, I definitely hear you Wade
and your message.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's also wonderful to see you Alice
and everyone who's joined Brian.
[SPEAKER_13]: Haven't heard from Kylie yet, but big love
to you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, Kelly wants to say something here
in a sec, but I just wanted to say really
[SPEAKER_13]: quickly, I think it's important that we
connect the medicine growers and makers to
[SPEAKER_13]: the customer and the consumer,
or I like a better word than customer and
[SPEAKER_13]: consumer, but to the compassionate care
family because often in these legalized
[SPEAKER_13]: paradigms, we have detached medicine
makers from the patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now patients have to go to an
alternative doctor or which is great,
[SPEAKER_13]: or a secondary source or a bud tender to
try and find out what the medicine maker
[SPEAKER_13]: is embodying.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we've seen like this last weekend
is a beautiful thing, a farmer's market in
[SPEAKER_13]: Northern California and the Sebastopol
area, give thanks, DEM pure farmers,
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of them were there and they were
able to share their homemade products,
[SPEAKER_13]: their natural farm regenerative farms,
regenerative medicine eco-packaged from
[SPEAKER_13]: the farmer to the consumer medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now when that person comes up to the table
and they make not only a chemical
[SPEAKER_13]: interaction through their conversation,
they're automatically now they're letting
[SPEAKER_13]: down and exudating chemicals based off
their conversation.
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows in that way, it opens up a
pathway to the medicine because now that
[SPEAKER_13]: person has an open pathway to the medicine
that they got from the medicine maker.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they're gonna be excited when they
get home to take that medicine because
[SPEAKER_13]: they talk to the person who created it
rather than the secondary bud tender,
[SPEAKER_13]: which I have all the love in the world
for, and I think anyone helping is great,
[SPEAKER_13]: but we should empower the farm gate sales
systems and these farmers market systems
[SPEAKER_13]: to happen in other places in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not only coming through therapy
sessions and Kelly had one more thing to
[SPEAKER_13]: say, did you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just, Wade, I wanted to touch on to
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were having actually a bit of a chicken
attack up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's time the goss talks like to come
around.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to run upstairs and I was
listening to what you were just saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: Wade, first of all, so much love to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really wanted to say that there's a
real overlooked thing right now in the
[SPEAKER_09]: world as far as vitamin D and B12 and iron
uptake, and that's called MTHFR.
[SPEAKER_09]: So please have your doctor check for
MTHFR, which is a methylene
[SPEAKER_09]: tetrahydrofolate reductase, which means
that it's limiting your enzymatic uptake
[SPEAKER_09]: within your body.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something that Alan Beer had
brought up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He wrote a book, I believe in the 40s,
calling Is Your Body Baby Friendly?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because so many people were losing
children to this inability to uptake amino
[SPEAKER_09]: acids through this reductase.
[SPEAKER_09]: This absolutely is totally defined in
vitamin D as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So please have your doctor check for those
MTHFR mutations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just really wanted to say that and
pass on my love to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that a lot of people
continue to see low iron, low vitamin BD,
[SPEAKER_09]: low vitamin B12, and they don't know where
it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that is incredibly
common with European descent people,
[SPEAKER_09]: because basically the people who survived
were the people who came from clodders.
[SPEAKER_09]: So heavy duty- Survived on the battlefield
or- Yeah, if a lot of us that are white
[SPEAKER_09]: European descendants, the reason why we're
still alive is because we came and
[SPEAKER_09]: survived from people that clodded.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people that bled out weren't able to go
have more generations.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is incredibly prevalent.
[SPEAKER_09]: This man, Alan Beer, had said he was seen
as a heretic.
[SPEAKER_09]: They took away his license.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said that it was maybe one in every
four people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're actually recognizing it
could be three in every four people with
[SPEAKER_09]: the possibility of six different
mutations.
[SPEAKER_09]: This absolutely is totally interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is absolutely critical to our
endocannabinoid system, the uptake of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids where people are having a lot
of toxic issues with different types of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids, as well as toxic issues with
food.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a real root of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know I'm going off on this,
but it's really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: So love you, Abe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious that you mentioned that,
because I have four out of the six
[SPEAKER_03]: mutations for the MTHFR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a supplement with folic acid
and methylfolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after years of trying much of
different SSRIs and other antidepressants
[SPEAKER_03]: in therapy, simple two B vitamins have
made all the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hugely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the vitamin D deficiencies are,
yeah, they're more, I don't think all the
[SPEAKER_03]: mutations are identified.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sent a couple of articles up or at
least references earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, again, it's complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more data we have, the better
we're able to identify and treat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanted to say in conjunction
with that vitamin D and the inability to
[SPEAKER_09]: uptake the vitamin D through this
methylation issue, which also leaves
[SPEAKER_09]: toxicity within our body for longer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people who have more mutations will
hold on to toxins in their body much
[SPEAKER_09]: longer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people who don't have any MTHFR
mutations maybe can get over a hangover
[SPEAKER_09]: within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: People with many different mutations,
maybe it could take them two weeks,
[SPEAKER_09]: two months, to six months to actually get
over that, you know, that alcohol abuse
[SPEAKER_09]: that they had had.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wanted to say a side door to the
vitamin D is silica.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's also one that is very not
utilized.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever we test our blood, when we test
soil, when we test plants, when we test
[SPEAKER_09]: our food, silica is low.
[SPEAKER_09]: So silica can help propagate the uptake of
vitamin D as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, so like when I drink this,
I put in C90 into this, which is,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, dehydrated ocean water is 84
trace mineral plus six rare earth elements
[SPEAKER_13]: that are coming up from ocean vents.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's 50,000 organisms that
come alive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I take it down from boiling and then I
put a little bit of chlorella or a little
[SPEAKER_13]: bit of spirulina in there along with the
rocket cow and the lion's mane and a
[SPEAKER_13]: little bit of maca.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay, you're hearing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, the point is that, you know,
it really is and it can become an amazing,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, food as medicine and break the
blood brain barrier and add trace minerals
[SPEAKER_13]: to your diet along with the allergies.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the nootropic medicine of lion's mane,
you know, is something to look towards is
[SPEAKER_13]: nootropic medicine, cellular regenerative
medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the moral of the story is here is that
we are producing foods that are devoid of
[SPEAKER_09]: full spectrum minerals.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore we are starting to produce
humans that are unable to fully uptake all
[SPEAKER_09]: the minerals because minerals are not
there and available.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why it's really important for us
to continue with mineral uptake.
[SPEAKER_13]: And breed food for higher amino acids,
breed food and medicine for higher
[SPEAKER_13]: flavonoids and more color content.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause those are the secondary spectrums
that enhance, you know, what the main
[SPEAKER_13]: constituents have to offer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to shift the conversation a
little bit back to bring Kylie into the
[SPEAKER_15]: conversation and to welcome Brian from D
Nail who just rolled in.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought the one thing we didn't hit too,
too much on today is kind of like,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, where we're, you know,
we've talked about trying to create this
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of think tank group and shared
lexicon, just kind of go down this rabbit
[SPEAKER_15]: hole and, you know, having, you know,
kind of the having the, the technology or
[SPEAKER_15]: device that allows for the most,
you know, unique preservation of the
[SPEAKER_15]: profile before it actually gets to your,
your mouth and into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause that's really, you know,
you can test anything that you want.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can test the flour, you can test the
hash, you can test the oil, but until you
[SPEAKER_15]: heat it up and, and volatize it into your
throat, that's really the compounds that
[SPEAKER_15]: you're getting, not the ones that you may
have tested prior at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Nick had mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just thought it would be cool to
introduce you, Brian, and get Kylie back
[SPEAKER_15]: in the conversation and kind of talk a
little bit about, cause you've been doing
[SPEAKER_15]: crazy things, dude, also, like just the,
the artistic nature of what you've been
[SPEAKER_15]: doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can tell by how beautiful and
symmetrical it is that it's somehow
[SPEAKER_15]: better.
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe you can speak a little bit of
that, Brian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick is my microphone work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hear myself and I've had equipment
issues in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: On that subject, we had a really
interesting revelation recently where
[SPEAKER_06]: previously we've been considering our work
in terms of flavor and having been
[SPEAKER_06]: originally based in New York, we couldn't
talk about any of the other pharmacology
[SPEAKER_06]: without risking a huge legal
consideration.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the newer nails that run a
little bit more efficiently, people keep
[SPEAKER_06]: asking, why am I getting a different high?
[SPEAKER_06]: How am I getting higher?
[SPEAKER_06]: How am I still up?
[SPEAKER_06]: And alert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had this epiphany that as we've
been pursuing flavor preservation,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've been changing the pharmacology too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's flavor is chemical preservation
through phase change.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be able to take your
substance, convert it to a gas,
[SPEAKER_06]: get it through your system as quickly as
possible without degradation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're, we're using a non-homogeneous
substance with things that vaporize across
[SPEAKER_06]: a huge spectrum of temperatures,
which often gives a, you have to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to degrade to THC, to Delta nine
from THCA in order to get the pharmacology
[SPEAKER_06]: and be a lot of the other elements are
getting time to destroy themselves in the
[SPEAKER_06]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we hit new heights in efficiency,
we haven't done chemical testing on it,
[SPEAKER_06]: just anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pretty sure that what we're seeing
is a lower mitigation of CBN from the
[SPEAKER_06]: higher efficiency nails and higher
efficiency systems, lending itself to a
[SPEAKER_06]: completely different high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like Marcus said, we're final delivery
device.
[SPEAKER_06]: How efficient that is throw a dab in an
800 degree banger and you do not have,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you might want that effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want something that's burned to
some of the terpenes and has a high CBN
[SPEAKER_06]: content is going to help put you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the subtlety, the fine points,
the harder to reach stuff, really doing
[SPEAKER_06]: justice to everything, the growers,
the breeders, the processors have worked
[SPEAKER_06]: so hard to get into the jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need an ultra efficient system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And having spent time originally in nail
design, and then in cannabis distillation
[SPEAKER_06]: and distillation theory, coming back to
nail design with advanced distillation
[SPEAKER_06]: theory under my belt, man, the effects are
actually stunning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not a research facility,
we're a development facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in order to actually sit down and do
that, we'd need to do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled situations, put the same oil
in, run it through a bunch of systems,
[SPEAKER_06]: different temperatures, different systems,
different materials present, but I
[SPEAKER_06]: guarantee you you'll find different
results in the vapor coming off of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that can lead to an intelligent guide
for how to use your tools to get what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're looking for from your oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really the last, it's the last
stage in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what happens right before it goes to
your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't talk about the farming,
I couldn't talk about the biology of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the physics of it that actually
preserve it motion, or in some cases
[SPEAKER_06]: intentionally control the degradation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really studied, and it's
something I've spent my life's work on,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I only kind of realized in the last
year that we're changing how high you get,
[SPEAKER_06]: or what kind of high you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot to do there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could go into the specifics of how it
all works, but that's the broad overview
[SPEAKER_06]: of where I am in my work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at controlled conditions
that actually do in your hardware,
[SPEAKER_06]: give you some options on how you're
outputting your chemicals.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your favorite temperature to smoke
at?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, first, there's no one answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, it's depending on your system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say we're using a temperature controlled
heater on a sapphire electric nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're going just for flavor,
we're going in just at about 420 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: on the heater setting, which is giving us
about 400 degrees on the nail,
[SPEAKER_06]: just enough to vaporize everything and
have really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to give you any sort of
large volume of dab, and sometimes you can
[SPEAKER_06]: be distilling off some of the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like sapphire because, for reasons
unknown to me, it doesn't like to just
[SPEAKER_06]: distill off the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: It likes to peel it off in layers and
vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: On a slurper, we'll go in at 575 on the
stem, which is way too hot to go in on a
[SPEAKER_06]: banger, but physics of phase change,
if you're quickly and efficiently
[SPEAKER_06]: evaporating off of something that's higher
than your boiling point, you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: change phase and escape at your boiling
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since it's a torch system, we don't have a
good electric slurper workout.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're effectively able to bypass what
your working temperatures would be and get
[SPEAKER_06]: a longer dab window out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The kind of oil, the terpian content
present, what you're actually trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: achieve, there's always a trade-off
between flavor and vapor.
[SPEAKER_06]: The high end right now is 575 on the
centrifugal vertical lift torch systems,
[SPEAKER_06]: the low end being about 420 on a sapphire
temperature controlled heater.
[SPEAKER_06]: Past that, we find that our new carb cap
is so efficient, we have to pull our
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures down and use about half the
breath pressure to get the same exact
[SPEAKER_06]: effects on one of the systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your hardware, your tools, your oil,
pure diamonds, you want to run in hotter
[SPEAKER_06]: because you don't have terpenes to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be able to break them down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that's super duper saucy,
you need to come down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a billion different kinds of oil and
100,000 different kinds of desired effects
[SPEAKER_06]: of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a range.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no one answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my experience, sufficiency is related
to vaporizing each of the individual
[SPEAKER_02]: components in your concentrate at the
lowest possible temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking cold starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you subject certain light volatiles
to high temperatures, there's a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature difference there and a more
likelihood of it converting into something
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be potentially toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're doing is... That degradation
from happening, it's going to degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to degrade, but can you control
the degradation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A low ramp, or do you want to just drop it
on something that's 400 degrees and take
[SPEAKER_02]: the chance that you're going to possibly
be breaking it apart?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are probably intimately familiar
with that Dr. Robert Strongin at Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the guy that basically said,
oh, be careful when you dab because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to degrade things into acrolein and
benzene and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the 710-mersene study?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great science.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was interesting, Brian,
because when I first saw that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wow, I need to reproduce this
because this is really important to either
[SPEAKER_01]: say this is bullshit or that this is
really happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you pull his procedure,
he had one of those stupid smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck do you get that,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't using the right test equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I chime in about- He's getting a lot
of press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's getting a lot of people
concerned and worried about consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't exactly know where to go with
that, but I think that there can be some
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Marcus Rogan, I don't know if
you guys know that guy up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he came up with some other type of
device that can measure some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and looking at different
conditions to try to understand what those
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation profiles are and what they're
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that there's a good
study out there that basically can
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I don't know whose turn it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I say one thing about degradation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'm off the floor for a second.
Please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took a minute to realize because it's
not obvious unless you're actually in it
[SPEAKER_06]: that getting the things through phase
change and out, it's about escape
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boiling point and your running
temperatures are the most important parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you've got a 385 degree banger and
it's got a two milliliter deep pool of
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff, terpenes that are trying to boil at
50, 80 Celsius, they're going to be stuck
[SPEAKER_06]: in the tar.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to get time and contact to
destroy themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's spinning around into a thin
film and a centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_06]: The vapor can escape.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's always changing phase at its
boiling point.
[SPEAKER_06]: You throw water at 250 degrees or a
million degrees, it's 212 in normal
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure the instant it's created.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every moment it gets in contact with that
higher heat source, it can overheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we're really doing,
it's fluid dynamics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hacks of getting the vapor to escape
as it's created.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I'm talking about running hotter on
these more efficient nails, we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: from room temperature outside the nail,
being processed in through up and around
[SPEAKER_06]: in less than a second in a lot of
instances.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just no time for it to overheat
even though it's briefly touching a higher
[SPEAKER_06]: heat source.
[SPEAKER_15]: Brian, do you mind putting a couple of
videos up like sharing your screen and
[SPEAKER_15]: showing some of the videos?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because earlier you said when you came out
of the distillation world, you were like,
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to apply some of that short path
molecular distillation or falling film or
[SPEAKER_15]: rising film evaporator aspect and create
bangers.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be great if we... If you tell me
your Instagram account, I just couldn't
[SPEAKER_15]: find it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I could find your personal one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've known you for like a decade.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got too many, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to reboot all our media.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at dnailusa.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's weird that that just didn't come up
in my search.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're a shadow band.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely you're a shadow band.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got some up here.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can keep talking or whoever's talking.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll show a few of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the conditions that I've been
looking at is obviously there's the vacuum
[SPEAKER_03]: distillation or ambient pressure and other
situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about it in terms of theoretical
plates if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you can get, the better
resolution you should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vacuums tend to reduce those and changing
the pressure conditions and the vapor
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a beautiful tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the thin film, it's a fantastic
way to get things to flash off real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you don't flood the plates or
don't overload it, it's a way to get them
[SPEAKER_03]: to go pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but we can't dab under vacuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could, my job would be easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're doing is taking the thin film
films, they're there for better escape
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been focusing on trying to have
every... This is going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: No accessories in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how in that video, everything's
spreading out into... Oh, lovely.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an attempt to miniaturize the
aspects of a thin film evaporator or a
[SPEAKER_06]: centrifugal evaporator.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dabber coming in from the outside is
running like your feed chamber.
[SPEAKER_06]: We run the dish at a lower temperature
like a prime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on how we do it, how we control
it, everything is going from room
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature to vapor so fast that it's
really mitigating the amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: degradation from the time component,
which does allow us to even run hotter.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually my favorite nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my most recent thought on how a
nail could, what should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Venus, Brian?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's Venus.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no time for anything to sit in a
hot puddle and cook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's only in the working zone when
it's being engaged.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everything's in motion,
the actual oil that's not contacting and
[SPEAKER_06]: getting vaporized doesn't get a chance to
overheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it falls back down to a cooler
chamber so it doesn't cook while it's in
[SPEAKER_06]: motion.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's just the most elegant iteration
of that particular design.
[SPEAKER_06]: The notion that this pursuit of efficiency
was leading to a preservation of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids just had not occurred to me
until earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flavor's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This work is overall concept, material
science, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have zero PhDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: My company has zero PhDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just think about how it all comes
together and keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, you don't need PhDs.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have D-A-Bs, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: PhDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to think that I've spent more time
thinking about dab physics than most
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plenty of qualified people that
could be brought up to speed, run circles
[SPEAKER_06]: around me, but they're usually doing more
traditional, conventional work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, by the way, you're one of the most
important people in this industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: scientifically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm honored to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which Mark?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark versus Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Marcus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus is industry glue.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, you're the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just the humble host.
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.
[SPEAKER_06]: People like you hold us together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark and I haven't really talked much,
but you pop up in a lot of circles and
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a lot of respect for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling is definitely mutual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's interesting that you say
dab physics because I never thought of it
[SPEAKER_01]: quite in those terms, but it certainly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you ever see this
misconception, but whenever you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: boiling points of the cannabinoids and
they list THC at 157 or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 315 Fahrenheit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize that when Mashula
measured that boiling point back in 1964,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was at a vacuum pressure of 0.05
torque.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the boiling point at atmospheric
pressure is much, much greater than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found is that, yeah, if you use
the number graph, you can basically find
[SPEAKER_01]: the boiling point of THC is somewhere
around 429 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're able to get some escape conditions
at lower temperatures than that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we are lowering the pressure with carb
caps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're also when it's in solution,
it's going to have some aspect of being
[SPEAKER_06]: able to escape a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are getting vapor with with dish
surfaces in the 400 range.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: A pure diamond isn't going to do much more
than melt at that point.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what about dimondium?
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you tell us a little bit about that
and why that's different from ruby?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you a little bit about it and
I'm still okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the relationship between material
science and dabs is something that I
[SPEAKER_06]: partially understand, having done this for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: This when we did a global survey about
nine years ago, the state of the art
[SPEAKER_06]: material science was the titanium guy
saying quartz would kill you, the quartz
[SPEAKER_06]: guy saying titanium would kill you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're like, there's got to be more to
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sorted materials by their ability to
withstand the conditions, both thermally
[SPEAKER_06]: and chemically, and then just started
looking for additional answers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We settled on silicon carbide and sapphire
as two of the materials we wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: introduce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've done a lot of work with other
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one in particular, and once we had an
understanding of the kind of things you'd
[SPEAKER_06]: see on a material spec sheet that would
actually lend themselves to flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of topped the charts
theoretically, but at the time it was
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of thousands of dollars a
kilogram.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we laughed and kept going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some patents expired, some prices came
down and the market changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That pillar that you just showed has a
retail of like $550 and it's 18
[SPEAKER_06]: millimeters by six.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is expensive, expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to do the inserts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we thought we'd actually be able to
get them cost effective and ended up doing
[SPEAKER_06]: small parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we saw in small parts was flavor
reviews in excess of what we thought was
[SPEAKER_06]: possible from small parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone putting a five millimeter sphere
in a banger, flavor reviews off the
[SPEAKER_06]: charts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the basic thermal properties,
that stuff moves heat over a thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: times faster than quartz.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost completely functionally inert
and it's extremely non-standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get that in motion in your system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You effectively have a spinning disc of a
heat super highway.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that does for quickly and
efficiently getting everything to phase
[SPEAKER_06]: change and get out is astonishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Astonishing to the point where people with
a low sense of smell or taste are trying
[SPEAKER_06]: it and hitting me back and saying,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd never tasted my oil before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark's nodding, but in order to get in,
that's some of the basics of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's more to it that I literally
don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, I literally don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian, like I don't see much ceramic nails
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those things gone?
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the ceramic nails that were the full
ceramic nails that were popularized were
[SPEAKER_06]: low grade Illumina prone to explosion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think enough time has passed that I
can say that the company was more of a
[SPEAKER_06]: stock market scam than a company.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are options for full ceramics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything that we like would be
dramatically more expensive than quartz.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still making ceramic parts,
ceramic inserts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't Puffco use the ceramic bowl?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're using, I believe they're
using a higher quality Illumina than,
[SPEAKER_06]: than Hive used to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hive was the company that really
popularized ceramic nails and they shot
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puffco I would say is probably,
I haven't tested it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Illumina.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the only thing that would fit their
price points.
[SPEAKER_06]: People make aftermarket parts for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quartz, silicon carbide, sapphire for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than silicon carbide inserts,
there's one that people have been using
[SPEAKER_06]: aluminum nitride.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, if you can find a paper that says
anything other than aluminum nitride
[SPEAKER_06]: degrades in contact with water and
shouldn't be used for dabs, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_06]: see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I've gotten a lot of shit for saying
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, a lot of things with those
ceramics is, is they're, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactured in bulk and unfortunately a
lot of them are made over in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always got to wonder like what kind
of trace components might be in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like the whole thing with
shiny metal, you know, objects that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting from a Chinese factory could have
any number of, you know, cadmium,
[SPEAKER_01]: lead, mercury.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are the impurities that are often
present in ceramics just basically take
[SPEAKER_01]: those completely off the table?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ceramic is as broad of a term as metal.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you say you can't get good ceramic,
you say you can't get good metal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get good glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just anything can be done with a
standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And ceramic is one of the broadest
categories of materials in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the reasons we're doing trade names
now is because everything we've done in
[SPEAKER_06]: new materials has opened us up to having a
lower grade impure copy of it done or some
[SPEAKER_06]: version of it, in many cases, so cheap
that people cut us out of our own
[SPEAKER_06]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've found that I've given people the
inspiration to make bad products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting way of looking at
it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, it's hard to patent stuff
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even if you get it through,
no one particularly cares.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, you know, when we, when we did
silicon carbide and sapphire, we just
[SPEAKER_06]: talked about them as what they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: If people are using jewelry grade sapphire
and ruby on everything, we're still using
[SPEAKER_06]: optical grade sapphires on everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, we could, we could get the,
we used to pay $250 for sapphire parts and
[SPEAKER_06]: sell them for 300.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause 250 was what they cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one wanted to pay more than 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: New technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add the issues with supply chains affected
your, your raw material costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_06]: Raw materials, not so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually the electrical components for the
DL controllers have been the problem where
[SPEAKER_06]: we suffered.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, we, for, for raw materials,
quartz is going to go up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every place that we've, that we were
finding our raw materials, we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: go up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to address it with,
with bulk increases in purchases to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: everything the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, no, we're going to see crazy
inflation and everything is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: weird soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you are also seeing other companies
coming around and start to knock off even
[SPEAKER_11]: your, the, you know, here, you know,
you're saying, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, it shows you that you were ahead
of the curve and the industry is coming
[SPEAKER_11]: around to your thought once they realize
and understand what they are having,
[SPEAKER_11]: what they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to thank you personally.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been using your stuff for nearly a
decade or, you know, since your inception
[SPEAKER_11]: and your consistent availability to always
improving yourself and never settling for
[SPEAKER_11]: what is out there and always pushing the
boundaries is something that needs to be
[SPEAKER_11]: applauded and commended because it's very
expensive and hard to do this type of
[SPEAKER_11]: research and development.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank you for the love you've given
me and the discounts over the years,
[SPEAKER_11]: because I gift all these things to other
people and stoners who are just coming on
[SPEAKER_11]: because, you know, again, it was very
expensive early on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the price of your components are much
more in reach of your average consumer,
[SPEAKER_11]: as opposed to just being within the reach
of, you know, those that could afford a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So not only congratulations on your
creation, but creating new things,
[SPEAKER_11]: but also bringing price points down.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's more affordable over time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you absorb those costs through all
of your R and D because it's so expensive
[SPEAKER_11]: though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know most people don't have the cojones
to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being a leader and a pioneer
in that resolve, because that's why I
[SPEAKER_11]: continue to follow you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what you do is because you don't
settle for what's out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't even settle for your own.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're always trying to find new paths and
new pathways, which too few companies in
[SPEAKER_11]: the DAB industry are doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So everyone wants to be second,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife, my wife says that all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cheap to be second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, ditto for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I froze up, but exactly what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same for me, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: That diamondium is next level for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you worked at the same, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragonfly family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big love, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your work is top notch.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one touches it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody want to give me like a billion
dollars and a bunch of grad students that
[SPEAKER_06]: no one needs back anytime soon?
[SPEAKER_06]: I got stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'd be able to find you some grad
students.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a billion.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, you're watching and you want
to contribute.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the people that are passionate,
that care, that take the time,
[SPEAKER_11]: that are always thinking out and sinking
through it.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the people that are leading us
in a better, more healthier and more
[SPEAKER_11]: helpful way.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, any type of harm reduction one
can do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a permanent patient.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So any type of less harm reduction,
the more harm that I can do to myself,
[SPEAKER_11]: the better I can prolong my life and I can
educate my patients to prolong their
[SPEAKER_11]: lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for giving us the tools that
allow us to help prolong people's lives.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something I think that isn't really
thought or understood as well,
[SPEAKER_11]: but you understand that gravity and you
challenge yourself to do better.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's again, more reasons why I love
y'all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shoulders are giants too.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was a crime most of my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was weird to not pursue an academic
career and decide to just work on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't imagine a different life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Proud to be here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: There could be a lot of health
practitioners that don't have jobs anymore
[SPEAKER_13]: because of mandates.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, you could have like a lot of
people on your hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: If people are giving away a billion for
research, I could use two billion.
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome Sam, by the way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even notice that has church was
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was laying in bed and then, and I looked
on the computer and I said, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you made it dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling you, I was going till noon
today.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we still got about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm 15 minutes will really hold everything
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, don't you have one of those index
labs units?
[SPEAKER_15]: I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Howdy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Howdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys smoking on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what it's called, but it's.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty, it's fairly good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a little check-in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some stuff that I want to give a
huge shout out to seven 10 labs for
[SPEAKER_04]: gifting me plethora of their work and
everything that they'd gifted me was
[SPEAKER_04]: stellar and really impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love seeing people with such
passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope to sit down with y'all one day
and, and session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm smoking is Ross.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but, uh, I forget the, the actual
name of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got some, uh, arcade fire, uh,
Eagle scout rec is what I'm dabbing on
[SPEAKER_11]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was smoking on some Hank earlier this
morning that I got from, uh, Marcus bubble
[SPEAKER_13]: man and, uh, some of the people over at
the embark and, and that product,
[SPEAKER_13]: that was pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, also I wanted to shout up a best
friend farms, Brian over in Maine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, he's just becoming DEM peer certified
and out on his farm in Maine and,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, connecting with the community out
there and the regenerative farms and just,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, everyone's doing really out there and,
uh, the genetics that he's been breeding
[SPEAKER_13]: just for on a personal level for himself
is just really amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the rosin and all the different
creations that he's made.
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously he's been on hash church
lots of times.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we just wanted to figure out their best
friend farms and really the whole main
[SPEAKER_13]: group is, is really pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're doing, doing really beautiful
stuff along with Michigan and not to leave
[SPEAKER_13]: out anyone, but, you know, I'm talking
about, you know, Ryan over there and just
[SPEAKER_13]: wanted to say, you know, you know,
the work he's doing with hash and rosin
[SPEAKER_13]: and, and also breeding and then now,
you know, whole ecosystem farming and
[SPEAKER_13]: health and wellbeing is pretty,
it's pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's doing a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I sent him the link.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure why he's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spoke to him yesterday and, um,
and this morning actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, Brian, if you're listening,
he might be having technical problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he's been having some internet
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I second everything you say
his work is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Top-notch Maine is an incredible place and
some amazing talent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've got some brave book gardens
right here for Maine, incredible indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and the whole Maine community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big love to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I'll join you one day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, also, uh, Brian, Mr. Schroeder,
um, uh, these type two, uh, caps you
[SPEAKER_11]: should get a Nobel prize for.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these are absolutely brilliant,
absolutely intelligent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So easy to use.
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes the flow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Except if you, if you want to screw this
and lose the piece, and then you have to
[SPEAKER_15]: use these with the, with the tweezers like
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get you a new dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to take a good look at it at the one
at the ends using versus yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: There there's like, there's clearly six
years of technology between them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you got one of the old school ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the first carb cap was a straight
hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it splashed everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just made a quick change to it to
mix everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that, the one that at the ends
using, uh, completely different physics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to use like half as much pressure
to hit that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Compared to this one, which was a previous
iteration, which was, I love these,
[SPEAKER_11]: these are great.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish you still made these.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it kind of was part of that early,
uh, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've made the taller ones,
but these are perfect size.
[SPEAKER_11]: They only have one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you've probably now it would have
two holes in it if you actually did them
[SPEAKER_11]: currently, but they're just perfect size
and weight.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I liked how you also, these cascades
matter because of heat absorption.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as well as this stays a lot cooler up
here than if it were down here or if it
[SPEAKER_11]: were straighter.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these types of curves, uh, as well as
swells in the glass itself make a
[SPEAKER_11]: difference in, uh, how long you can keep
these.
[SPEAKER_11]: The dabber on top to absorb because of,
again, the older technology of the dab who
[SPEAKER_11]: were using at the time, but thickness of
it as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could hold it and sustain it for a
longer time for a longer, slow temp dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then if I did something and these,
these first gen, uh, de-nail caps that of
[SPEAKER_11]: course the heat just sank so quickly all
the way up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you went as long, you would literally
burn your fingers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to remove this metal as opposed to
this glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, if you have our dabber instead
of another one, uh, the our dabber has a
[SPEAKER_06]: heat sink built into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got a thinner area where you can
handle it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Marcus was holding up a cast sterling
silver topper that our friends' family
[SPEAKER_06]: made.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's like 10 of those in the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that was just some gifts that we had
for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, my wife's got one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I don't know where the rest went.
[SPEAKER_06]: But man, there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I think that was your Christmas
present a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of work left to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the reflex machine you were talking
about, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Kylie's in the room, Sam, the,
uh, gentleman who designed that unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one is he?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have the Insane 1100?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the Insane 1100 is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there's a, there's the, there's the
larger units.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's got a portable battery
power cells in it and it weighs a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's hilariously
over-engineered.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think mine has batteries in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone help Kylie find a workaround for
shipping.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting regulations and there's gotta
be a workaround.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I can tell you about his life is
it takes, it makes almost everything taste
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially the first half of the hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, uh, Kylie share your screen,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I just talk?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know, so the bottom there is a
little, if you look in the bottom menu of
[SPEAKER_03]: the screen, there's a green share screen
icon.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got him pinned right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's the, his screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: The screen is the main screen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's looking at that working.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work on myself, but here's a new
briefcase I'm taking out to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have that big model.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why I don't have it,
but I don't know why, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like it, but it's fairly
complicated to use compared to a regular
[SPEAKER_07]: Dapper.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my only complaint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand how the size,
shape and quantity and composition
[SPEAKER_02]: controls the vaporization process and
then, uh, set your timing periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on your unit right there,
you have it set at like 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the smallest elements, you can run
it continuous, like up to five cycles or
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you use the larger, the quicker
heating materials, you want to set the
[SPEAKER_02]: timer at a lower period.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, with the glow sticks,
I like setting at 25 seconds running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll get me right to preheat at the
very onset of vaporization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll taste those light volatiles and
that sweet neck three flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll turn the dial down to 10 and
run subsequent cycles from there to extend
[SPEAKER_02]: the session without overheating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, everybody it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing a musical instrument.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to master it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one that I want to master.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to learn this instrument.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're welcome to come on over here
and, uh, you can play with it for three
[SPEAKER_07]: days in a row.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what you like.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Open invitation to skunk man's house to
play with this reflux machine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I've been using a lot lately is
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the scope and stack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard great things about that one
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the comments that this is where
we start selling stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, a lot of the stuff of mine you guys
plugged.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even have in stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's for you guys to decide
listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're definitely worth it though.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the conversation.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I, the, the, the people that I know
and I know how they, how they dab and what
[SPEAKER_06]: they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I've done some promotional stuff with
bubble man and the past, but it was never
[SPEAKER_06]: a paid promotion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was here's a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do an honest review.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if, if you like it, speak,
speak well of it, but otherwise don't,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, the, the, what I'm seeing here,
it's, it's not paid promo.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's P it's people that know this industry
inside and out telling you guys what they
[SPEAKER_06]: actually believe in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and I, for whatever my word is worth,
that's, that's the truth, not an ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I write it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never paid for any promotion
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw word of mouth be my only
marketing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why I've used my word of mouth
to spread the words of those companies
[SPEAKER_11]: that haven't worked.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I can go back to having the
first attempt temple, which was the first,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, I guess electronic rig after the
highly educated, I guess was the first
[SPEAKER_11]: one, but it was in such limited
quantities.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find one.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had to order one of those temp
temples from, um, Canada, which is this
[SPEAKER_11]: crazy X box with that, uh, a crazy crow,
that big chrome one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was obnoxious, but it's wild and it
should, I also had to create and,
[SPEAKER_11]: and, uh, shift the actual, um,
coil around the nail originally because it
[SPEAKER_11]: didn't come attached or have an
understanding.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have seen the progression from
starting off in myself, 2011 with the
[SPEAKER_11]: torch and then looking for something that
didn't scare women or people that are
[SPEAKER_11]: around because, you know, when you're just
hanging out, you whip out a fucking huge
[SPEAKER_11]: old fucking blazer.
[SPEAKER_11]: People fucking get nervous because their
association from television, everything is
[SPEAKER_11]: that you're using crack, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: So they start to think that, Oh,
Jesus Christ, he's using a rack and creme
[SPEAKER_11]: brulee torch and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: You just use the straight propane torch,
like ghetto heating up spoons and shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we must've looked completely
psychotic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so then when these more refined
products came available, and temp temple
[SPEAKER_11]: didn't last long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so then it was to find anybody who was
producing any type of electronic nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, you've been a trailblazer from
your initial creation, which was the first
[SPEAKER_11]: one that I found that was kind of a plug
and play.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything all fit together.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was easy to assemble.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't intimidating out the boxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no way I could take somebody who
was a patient and then get a temp temple
[SPEAKER_11]: and show them, okay, now you're going to
need crimpers and some major actual
[SPEAKER_11]: wrenches here to wrap this thing around
this titanium.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: So where those ones also caught fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they had just a piece of electrical
tape, you know, that, that raw aluminum
[SPEAKER_06]: shell, uh, there were live terminals,
like three millimeters away from them with
[SPEAKER_06]: when the electrical tape that they just
kind of put over it came off fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, they were pretty, they,
they had a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did it, but I mean, like they
shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've, I've fixed a number of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've talked to a number of people who
like tables or rooms or houses Burke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I was, I was doing, uh, high energy
experiments in my, in my apartment late at
[SPEAKER_06]: night, uh, when, when they were putting
them out, but no, you're, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and that's, that's one of,
uh, sorry, bigger picture stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: This industry, you can just slap something
together and sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing stopping people from
making bad products here at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know when that's going to
change, but.
[SPEAKER_13]: Seems to be encouraged.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got our first vaporizer from Ontario
back in probably the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a botanical.
[SPEAKER_13]: They sold it as a botanical vaporizer and
they gave you a whole, uh, catalog of
[SPEAKER_13]: lavender and basil and Mullen and mint and
time, all the different things that you
[SPEAKER_13]: could smoke in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was a kind of cylindrical shaped
little unit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it had a.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ceramic bowl in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I forget the name of the company at
the time, but it was, it was the first one
[SPEAKER_13]: that we ever saw in the electronic form
before the volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then some of those are earlier,
you know, different, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: vaporizers that became popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: The volcano was before 2000.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but for some reason we didn't have
the volcano here in the Kootenays early
[SPEAKER_13]: two thousands yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought it to BC.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought the volcano and the volcano
could be used for dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just put that fat little, uh,
Brillo pad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Brillo pad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my dry sip bubbled and melted and they
perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still use like a, like you're
describing a bowl when we drill on the top
[SPEAKER_04]: and put a tube in and then take a
soldering gun and then put a metal piece
[SPEAKER_04]: on top of that and then put the material
on top of that and let it vape.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got turned on to vaporization in 95,
first in Jamaica by a Rastafarian elder
[SPEAKER_15]: named red, who showed me this very simple
method that they were using to vaporize
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis with, which blew me away.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the same year I, I had a booth at
the cannabis cup next to Eagle bill.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he had like the heat gun with the,
with the quartz bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, all right, let's give this
a shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Steneal gun with the big, like
Steinal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first time I saw it was in,
uh, 98 at Holy smoke on a coal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the mayor I saw was 1985 in Santa
Cruz, California.
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine named Chris card invented
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they used a, uh, also a heat strip gun
to, to function.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a big water pipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I had suggested to him that we
could get some sort of a small microwave
[SPEAKER_07]: device to either microwave buds or a hash
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And instead of microwaves, which he said
wasn't practical and small enough and
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't safe to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we, we, he came up with this and,
uh, yeah, he spread it to all the buyers
[SPEAKER_07]: clubs in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then eventually it got around the
world and companies like volcano and
[SPEAKER_07]: others kind of vault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Riptick made an actual glass connector,
which is a two piece that you could
[SPEAKER_11]: actually slip your, uh, hot air gun into.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they promoted the Steinels and why the
Steinels is because the Steinels had a
[SPEAKER_11]: ceramic core as opposed to a metal core.
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: No asbestos.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you were inhaling it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to roll into parties with the rip
tech and a bong and just destroy parties
[SPEAKER_11]: and then quietly just disappear.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people were like, what the fuck just
happened?
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have mine right over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were doing it with weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't doing it with hash,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were only doing with weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were not doing with hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been thinking about hash because we
had access to more flour than anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this is the late nineties in LA and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got one of the first.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, machines, the original isolator
machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, when I worked at the galaxy gallery
back in 90, uh, in 90, 97, 98.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and that's, but that's when we started
playing with hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: But before then it was strictly just,
you know, what we could do with flour.
[SPEAKER_11]: And prior to that, the only extent of a
vaporizer that I had heard of was that
[SPEAKER_11]: cheap piece of shit that they sold in head
shops.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some friends of mine grabbed when I was up
in Pennsylvania, they grabbed it a head
[SPEAKER_11]: shop and it was a plastic piece with a
soldering iron with a flat soldering,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, kind of a piece and a glass
piece over it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the BC vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was just, they sold like 12,000
of them or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the worst thing ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were so excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we tried, it was like, this thing is
awful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you ever get to try the volatizer for
David Wheeler, the small little wand that
[SPEAKER_15]: fit into a quartz bowl?
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause prior to that, I was living with the
Vriptec and I was condensing the oil in
[SPEAKER_15]: the glass stem of the Vriptec bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would be a red oil and I would dab
it, smoke it on a screw, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: a little bit of bubble or whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this volatizer came out and the
whole bowl was quartz.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was the first quartz vaporizer that
I'd seen.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I noticed was that the oil,
when it was turned into a vapor and then
[SPEAKER_15]: precipitated back into a liquid in the
stem of the quartz, that it no longer did
[SPEAKER_15]: that into an orange or a red liquid,
but it precipitated back into an
[SPEAKER_15]: absolutely gold liquid.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was like a huge sort of
revelation back in like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: the late nineties or whatever.
Wow.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing nice about the reflux is
that they give you this little for the
[SPEAKER_07]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is the balls because even
though they're glass jars, they're what
[SPEAKER_07]: fits into the res tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the reflux and it works really
good because you've always got a clean
[SPEAKER_07]: one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see those ones are the used
ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are unused.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's sweet to have that many as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's nice being able to preload your
full day if you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm figuring I'll probably go through 50
loads at the Emerald Cup in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a rotary feed like I have on my
gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_07]: It holds 96 little bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like a revolver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave out like a pound of oil at one of
the cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 loads might be low.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gave it to me, don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it to like a thousand people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Constantly changed my clothing and got
them all.
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to give around a hundred grams in
dabs out at the cannabis cup in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_15]: and I did it for, I don't know,
like a decade and a half or something.
[SPEAKER_15]: It ended up being a fair chunk of hash for
sure to give away.
[SPEAKER_15]: Literally a pound in a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: At Legends, we definitely smoked more than
a hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh gosh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it wasn't all mine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't gifting it to everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although the Legends in Vancouver was.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the first couple of Legends,
most of it was mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: But after that, everybody had really great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what Legends helped.
[SPEAKER_15]: It helped people step up and be like,
I want to make hash like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seemed like there needed to be a thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: There just needed to be a Legend.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a little light at the end of the
tunnel that people could catch a glimpse
[SPEAKER_15]: of and be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going for that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to get there.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they start, you know,
growing exceptional cannabis and
[SPEAKER_15]: processing exceptional hashes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, please.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say how many amazing
people over the years I met that just
[SPEAKER_15]: wanted to come to Legends.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the original way to get a ticket to
Legends for me was to show me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll finish it for him.
[SPEAKER_07]: The way to show was to show really good
hash to Marcus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he would let you in with that
entry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I never took any of the hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: I never like smoked it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just would look at it and be like,
yeah, that hash should be in the room at
[SPEAKER_15]: Legends.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's how we fill up the room each
year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now look what it's going to and it'll
just get bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, I was just going to say,
it's nice to recognize, which we talked
[SPEAKER_13]: about before.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was at the origins of, you know,
hash making and some, some of the hash
[SPEAKER_13]: like Malana and India are just having just
such hard times right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So any way that people can like learn
about what's happening in Malana and
[SPEAKER_13]: Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand,
all the mountainous regions and parts of
[SPEAKER_13]: India, you know, India is corporatizing
their cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like lots of other countries have in the
world and origin cities and origin hash
[SPEAKER_13]: making places in India.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, a lot of those families are,
are going to jail.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Hemvati on Instagram is a woman that
we've connected with over, over the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: She she's active on showing, you know,
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we appreciate her for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, anyone that, you know,
loves hash and, you know, and maybe has a
[SPEAKER_13]: voice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Somewhere that can help out in India,
you know, and write the correct people and
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff, you know, it would be greatly
appreciated because, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's out of, you know, out of thousands
of people, you know, hundreds are in jail
[SPEAKER_13]: right now and they don't know where they
are or even, you know, how to proceed
[SPEAKER_13]: with, with court cases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, grandmothers and grandfather
hash makers right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: getting swooped out of their mountain
villages and brought to a prison somewhere
[SPEAKER_13]: is, you know, super, crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have you been, have you been to India
and visited those places?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have, I have, I would like to do it
more, but we did a, a trip up the Parvati
[SPEAKER_13]: Valley and spent time in castle and up in
Tosh and, um, up in, in rat racial.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and in that area and we didn't go up
to Mulana, but, uh, you know, that whole
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of Kulu and, and, and zone we,
we do, we did, we did see that we went to
[SPEAKER_13]: Dharam Sala and, uh, and, uh, McClode ganj
as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've watched the Cora and spent time,
you know, learning more about like,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the Tibetan teachings and also
their refugee statuses and the whole free
[SPEAKER_13]: Tibet movement and what's happening to
Tibetans in India.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's people all over the world
in strife.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, we have been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Years and years ago, the only country that
was making, uh, both hand rubbed,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, dry sift and, uh, uh, was cashmere.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no other country in the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cashmere was the first country to be
making both types commercially.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now Pakistan just legalized,
I hear.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I heard Imran Khan, uh, just like cut
ribbons at a brand new, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: open cannabis farm in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also it, did I hear right?
[SPEAKER_13]: That Dubai is now open to cannabis is
there's new laws passing in the world that
[SPEAKER_13]: are pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So has Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's the connection is that I do
buy in Malaysia making, and I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: The queen of Dubai potentially is working
on like a CBD product, but then that could
[SPEAKER_13]: open up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't forget about, don't forget about
Germany.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and then the seed companies that got
busted in Spain.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was like a crazy, you know,
uh, you know, bust that happened in Spain
[SPEAKER_13]: and there's a huge seed company transition
happening in Europe.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Europe's really kind of, it feels like
there's a lot of flux happening there.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the moment.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not there obviously, but we have a lot
of family over there and it seems so yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the seed bus happened, I could
actually hear your voice, uh, Sam saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, they broke international laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they did, but the real problem I
think down there was, I'm not exactly sure
[SPEAKER_07]: of the circumstances, but, uh,
it's not legal to cultivate in Spain for
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds or for weed to sell unless you're
licensed by the government.
[SPEAKER_07]: And none of those companies were licensed
by the government.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm guessing LaGuardia like ran
through their shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that what happened?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure exactly what happened in
Spain, except for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a, a, a, a big mix up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was told it was federal, their
version of federal agents.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that really,
you know, what that looks like,
[SPEAKER_13]: but, um, I know that the court case that
they're in right now over, over it,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, is definitely a potential,
you know, transformation of European laws.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know it because it is such a,
you know, a big court case and there's,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's pretty large seed companies
involved.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I hope it all works out,
you know, in favor for the companies
[SPEAKER_13]: involved.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there, because some of them were
close, pretty close friends with ours.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a shame.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think any of the seed companies
selling seeds from Spain, the research
[SPEAKER_07]: companies are licensed, but I don't think
any of the seed companies selling
[SPEAKER_07]: commercially are actually licensed by the
government to produce their seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_15]: Seems like a big issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the regulations in
Portugal are.
I don't know what the regulations in
Portugal are.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, you get a feeling they're a
lot looser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was under the impression.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are doing it through
Portugal, but I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been decryptalized there,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm heading there in July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll ask around.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a mission.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it legal to grow cannabis in Portugal
for seed production?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one does.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I moved to Holland, it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as long as you did not divert the
cannabis to illegal markets, the seed
[SPEAKER_07]: production was legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was till about 1998 or 99,
I think they changed the law.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Switzerland has areas where it has
favorable laws.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to shout up our Switzerland
family out there, Edelgreen Swiss Farm and
[SPEAKER_13]: everyone out there doing amazing work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there are jurisdictions that are
doing well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, I know that always people are
looking for a better spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple Swiss breeders who have
now moved into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one big breeder down in Oregon
somewhere with high VG and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different varieties, but they originated
in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe part of the regulation that
we're dancing around here is the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't have a decent seed export
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they set up here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and are now producing seeds here in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: And what?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they want to sell into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they want to sell into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can produce seeds in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that they're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The genetic backgrounds for that Swiss
material came from Italy, if it's what I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's right, Sam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have info in Portugal, according to the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just found some too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still illegal to grow, but they have
industrial hemp law and most likely any
[SPEAKER_06]: relevant seeds would have to come from a
plant that you can't legally grow unless
[SPEAKER_06]: you found some way to get a THC-bearing
strain through the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like there's a lot of stuff in
flux in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking to a guy on the Adam Dunn
Show the other day about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And does tissue culture get around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the regulation on seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not, because a lot of the
regulation is not just seeds, but like in
[SPEAKER_03]: Portugal, for example, it's illegal to
grow, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like a plant has germ plasma?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like germ plasma would probably
still be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Considered, yeah, illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get into something really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the plant itself, if it's a little
mini clone or grown through cellular
[SPEAKER_07]: culture, is illegal in most countries in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but some of these things are just
sort of like, it's like a little sachet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these things are usually filled
with alginic acid and it's just basically
[SPEAKER_01]: a piece of Maristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'd have to do some microscopic
analysis to determine that it was cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: or hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but if that was done, then it would
be illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just asked in the chat,
Oregon CBD Company, they're working with
[SPEAKER_04]: the university out of Mississippi or
something they're saying, or just the
[SPEAKER_04]: university.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's Mississippi,
but I would believe that's under the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal guidelines of the hemp bill,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be under Dr. El Solay at
Oxford University, correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxford University, wait a second,
University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, University of Mississippi and Oxford.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, yes, Oxford University at
Mississippi, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're not the same place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got better catfish in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just wanted to give thanks to everyone
today.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to take off and enjoy this
beautiful Sunday, super cold and lots of
[SPEAKER_13]: sun, got snow on the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we see y'all next week at the Emerald
Cup?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, we won't be able to make it
and a few of the farms will, but it's big
[SPEAKER_13]: up to Tim Blake and the family for making
it happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Much appreciation.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some regenerative talks Jesse's
putting on and some of our farms are
[SPEAKER_13]: involved with, definitely anyone involved,
go check in with the family at Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be sad that this year the teepee
will not be up and it will be sort of the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time in a really long time that it's
sort of, you know, it really sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: defines what's been going on these days
and we're sending all of the love and all
[SPEAKER_09]: of the gratitude for everybody who's
gathering and still joining and
[SPEAKER_09]: celebrating cannabis in the community.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not going to be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be sad, but we're stoked everybody's
getting together.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully next year it changes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for coming guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to, you know, thank everyone
actually for coming.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank Kylie for coming in from Indux Labs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank Nick for coming in and sharing,
you know, his experiences and information.
[SPEAKER_15]: Always a pleasure to see Dr. Mark and
Etienne and appreciate you coming in Brian
[SPEAKER_15]: and of course Colin and Wade and Etienne.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome to have both of you in as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome to have Dr. Allison slide in for a
little bit earlier, Josh and Kelly and
[SPEAKER_15]: everyone really who's been watching the
333 people who are watching this very
[SPEAKER_15]: minute.
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_15]: Go have a great Sunday with your family,
with your friends, with your pets or by
