[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble man and John B.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have everything from bubble nows,
plants, hash, pounds of weed, fresh
[SPEAKER_08]: frozen, ready to run, bubble bags,
bubble boxes, dry sift screens,
[SPEAKER_08]: med-tainers, basically we're going up to
Whistler and we're going to film our Puff
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesdays up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought, let's go make some hash on the
side of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to like, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm at Whistler and it's dumping up there
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man!
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about this for so long so
this is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sleds on the back of the truck just in
case.
[SPEAKER_08]: We might go do a back country adventure.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep you guys posted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep you guys posted.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2014 is looking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah dude, right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you guys soon!
[SPEAKER_08]: We're off to Whist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we are entering the Sea to
Sky Highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the road that will take us up to
Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, driving on the Sea to Sky
Highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I'm not allowed to consume
cannabis while I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_08]: But John's not driving, is he?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, John's not driving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And God, we've been on the road for what,
like three minutes now?
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it's just obviously we've gone
two minutes longer than we need to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you've been working hard for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely just going to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Full melt a many haze car rips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah!
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Smells really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the Pacific Ocean just on our
left.
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you that have driven up to
Whistler before, you may know the highway,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Sea to Sky Highway, the number 99.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got about a 900 million dollar overhaul on
this highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the Olympics came here in 2010.
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically made it so only a small
section of the highway is a single lane
[SPEAKER_08]: like what we're finding right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he was going pretty good,
wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_08]: That GoPro is really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny's up for Rippo number two.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to try and do 99 rips on the
way up to the Whistler here on the 99
[SPEAKER_08]: highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be the designated driver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a new section of the Sea to Sky
Highway actually right up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see how they've dynamited
through this mountain to extend the
[SPEAKER_08]: highway into a four lane.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never been up here in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Shannon Archer's memorial is just on
the other side where that young girl died
[SPEAKER_08]: in the car accident.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got a little memorial where the
highway used to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Across the way we have Anvil Island in the
clouds there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of looks like an Anvil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to the left of that further back we
have Gambier.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Defense Islands out front there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bowen Island back behind us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, just driving through by Shannon
Falls.
[SPEAKER_08]: The chief barely picking out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if we can see the falls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gondola.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for tourists.
[SPEAKER_08]: Driving through Squamish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Squamish Adventure Center.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, coming up here if you look to the
right you'll see white heads in the trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are bald eagles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's usually quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see two right there right by the
river.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we've got into a little snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right next to the Chicamas Creek.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'd like to be talking to some of
these places but it seems like I'm still
[SPEAKER_08]: down the road a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little early for where I come in
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish it wasn't but...
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey everyone!
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to Bubble Man's World!
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here with John B.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to Whistler!
[SPEAKER_10]: We're basically five minutes out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Function Junction.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go whip up the batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Up on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do some dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_10]: John's brought some beautiful colas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fresh off the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you in Whistler!
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming into Chicamas Cross and Function
Junction.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Creekside.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Old Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there's still some newer condos
over by the gondola which is right over
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the mountain.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, does it ever look like it's busy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heading over to the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: What have we here?
[SPEAKER_08]: The tools.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where we're going to be
spending the next 24 or so hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here at the Hotel Interwest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty nice little facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little one bedroom suite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have the D-nail set up on that ASAP.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our materials sitting out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The mountain view.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it's kind of being covered
right now by the fog.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course we have this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course we have this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know what that's for.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know what that is for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the good ice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, nice ice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice ice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's time to make some plans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we set up the mothership and get the
D-nail going?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to Bubbleman's World.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: John B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark R.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bubbleman.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hanging out with you in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can kind of see the runs are coming
out now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the mist is lifting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, both sides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we thought we would do a little puff
Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, why not?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got fresh frozen buds that John has
cut down just a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been frozen since he cut them
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: What strains?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a funny name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're going to get a lot of great
comments on YouTube for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But John has a strain called the My Little
Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is very unique in its flavor and its
taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you close your eyes, someone says
it smells like My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hence that's how the name came about.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is kind of how the name came about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that not in Toronto in May?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was that even pre?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pre-Toronto and then I laughed with
it in Toronto and it stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody just loved it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's funny, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: So of course we brought the D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mothership combo.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the Puking Bee Quartz Bowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope I pronounced that right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to pronounce that guy's
name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Puking Bee Beagle.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Master of Quartz.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you got some My Little Pony fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I made on Christmas day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll do a video upload some day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that looks nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got my macro lens so I'll be able to
shoot this and put it into the video so
[SPEAKER_08]: you can kind of see what we're hitting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about to drop this fresh frozen onto
the Quartz Nail and it's going at 750
[SPEAKER_08]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a little bit cold outside so we'll
see how the D-Nail performs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: even know how bubbly that is and you can
hear it just.
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a nice mothership of course.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a lovely taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smooth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's exciting to be up in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've been coming up here since
1991, but it's something I've never
[SPEAKER_08]: actually shared.
[SPEAKER_08]: On my channels or with my followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: This year you've probably heard me talk a
few times how I want to make it out to the
[SPEAKER_08]: glacier.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do a batch of bubble with my
crew, my back country crew, sledding,
[SPEAKER_08]: access only, get up to the Pemberton Ice
Caps into one of the ice caves and do a
[SPEAKER_08]: nice little batch of fresh frozen or even
some dry sifting as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: While also showing you the adventures that
we go through just to get to these areas
[SPEAKER_08]: and then of course, you know, to show you
some of the footage of the epic riding
[SPEAKER_08]: that goes on as well from ski flying to,
you know, cliff jumping and features off
[SPEAKER_08]: of epic back country cliffs and rocks and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So definitely looking forward to doing all
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just really excited to be up in
Whistler, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time we've been up here
filming.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it makes me want to hit another
bowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to try some of the many
eggs fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_08]: I will not say no.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will not say no?
[SPEAKER_08]: John is the fresh frozen king.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he showed me something that just at
least totally helps me so much with all my
[SPEAKER_07]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing I realized is actually the
fresh frozen is what helps me the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just the showing, John.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your humility in the way you accept
being shown.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you guys something.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes a long way to have someone tell
you something, show you something,
[SPEAKER_08]: and for you to listen to them to a point
where you benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you, John, from the get go,
from the dry sift cleaning 11 months ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then to the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a nice hit, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a golden delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the golden ticket right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I didn't know how much he's going to
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's by far, that was day 84.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course stop feeding on day 35.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once again, you're 40 day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is divine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so deep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so deep.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe how, um, how flavorful
that was.
[SPEAKER_08]: That really is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tasted almost like, like fresh
material.
[SPEAKER_10]: Scooper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta give it up to skillet tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love my gold skillet tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that beautiful?
[SPEAKER_08]: The color of that is absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just, it's, it's the
infamous white lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course what he's done is he's
gotten, I'd say 90% of it into pure
[SPEAKER_08]: perfect powder.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the tiny little chunks that
aren't pure perfect powder, they have a
[SPEAKER_08]: different color.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a little more caramely,
a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can tell that they have the
tiniest bit of moisture in them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dry parts are bone dry, but the little
other part, and I'll show you that while
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about it, you'll see these
photos appear.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, yeah, this one piece in
particular, really nice little kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: almost a little hot dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take a photo of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And did you, this is microplanned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely microplane.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course dried on cardboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm looking forward to photographing
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been rumors of people discussing,
um, well people always assume that certain
[SPEAKER_08]: things damage trichome heads, squeezing
them, um, grinding them, all these sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: variations of things that could
potentially damage a trichome.
[SPEAKER_08]: The macro camera lens really shows what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to photograph all John's
microplane bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get in really close and we'll see if
we can see any heads that have been,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, damaged or broken from the
color.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which it's pretty much white.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would guess that there's no damage
because if you breach those heads in any
[SPEAKER_08]: way and you let oxygen in, uh,
the color turns really fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Faster than say leaving it out to be
exposed to oxygen and, or, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: just light.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Those two things exposing it to those two
things will darken it as well over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you breach the head and let oxygen
actually get and touch those oils,
[SPEAKER_08]: they go red faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or dark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely great things to be learning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe how beautiful it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the, I can just see the peak to
peak gondola going from Whistler to
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackcomb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, would you like to hit the many A's?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they were both so nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go back to My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like the 70, 90 or 120?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go 73.
[SPEAKER_08]: 73.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's go 73.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you too, if any of you guys,
uh, are coming out to Whistler and you
[SPEAKER_08]: ride fairly well and you want to link up,
um, I'm definitely in a position where I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: always looking for good people to ride
with, always looking for people to link up
[SPEAKER_08]: with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the guy to find you, um,
your smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: So please don't ask, but I am the guy
that'll take you around the mountain and
[SPEAKER_08]: show you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do amazing places and maybe, you know,
have a, have a good afternoon together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll put that out there and,
uh, I'll put this in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always nice meeting new peeps.
[SPEAKER_07]: New peeps, new things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and this is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got this, uh, new med tan is that we're
coming up with these, uh, kind of some new
[SPEAKER_07]: things going on in our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did they do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a kind of a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just playing, people ask for
different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was like a couple of prototypes,
trying to get some opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun, you know, new colors,
new things, bubble bag lights,
[SPEAKER_07]: something else new that's coming in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they've been doing well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, people have been waiting for them
for them for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: People had been waiting for those for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now they have them and that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to let this dry out a
little bit quicker for those eager to
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very subtle thing to learn as a
hash smoker, the difference between a
[SPEAKER_08]: cured hash and a properly dried and cured
hash as opposed to wet hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really wet hash is pretty easy for
most people to decipher depending on how
[SPEAKER_08]: they're smoking as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it's one thing to use a beeline.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another to drop something into a,
onto a D-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this has changed everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely has.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, this is a whole new level now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: These electric nails are game changers for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really, uh, for, for full melt bubble
is just really, it's the only way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even have lighters anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't lit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we, we looked for one this
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: We couldn't find a lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since my first D-nail arrived,
I basically have not, even at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: cup this year, I smoked very few bolts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly everything was through the D-nail
through the electric nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: D-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mothership.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a beautiful combination.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just love it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you packed one that was fairly
big.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's still burning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoking off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have to go make some plans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're going to go make some plans.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to figure out where we're
going to go next.
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of want to take you guys up the
mountain, show you guys around a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able
to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I of course have a season's pass and have
a snowboard, but I'm hanging out with John
[SPEAKER_08]: for the day and he's not going to be going
snowboarding and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll probably, if anything,
make it up to one of the free parking lots
[SPEAKER_08]: up on black home at base two, you know,
drive around somewhere and find,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, find a little place that you can just
walk out of the parking lot onto the
[SPEAKER_08]: mountain and give you a little visual of
what's going on up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even get a lift pass and jump on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, we could potentially do that
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get, get you a lift pass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, if we do go up there,
we'll bring the camera with us and we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: show you what's going on up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most importantly, I hope to be making
some bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not today, we're going to do it
tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, potentially right here on the,
on the deck.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with the beautiful view, with the
beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't we finish off with showing
you that view and we'll talk to you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: real soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, good morning guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bulkman and John B here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just waking up here in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: We raged it pretty good last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, uh, ate pizza and we puffed hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, ate pizza and puffed hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had some friends over, uh, pro
photographer Mike Pelfridge was here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our friend Johnny, they brought a couple
of friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw my friend Ari from Texas Island that
I haven't seen in like a decade.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, we turned them all onto the D
nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this morning, John and I are trying to
figure out where are we going to make
[SPEAKER_08]: bubble with you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got this beautiful, fresh,
frozen nugget that John cut down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we've got our bags and our buckets.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've even got a bubble now if we have
power, but we're kind of trying to give
[SPEAKER_08]: you something a little bit more than just
a hotel session.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're thinking we're going to go out on
the mountain somewhere, either near the
[SPEAKER_08]: Chicamas river or up on Whistler,
uh, Creekside.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure exactly where, but we
figured we do a couple of Davos before we
[SPEAKER_08]: start.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little dab will do you.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little dab will do you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll do the, uh, a little GoPro,
uh, the GoPro dab cam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dope GoPro dab cam.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dabbing fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that shatter of butter we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about real medicine here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it wouldn't say it's all
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just say clean, organic medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite important you get your
cannabinoids up in the morning to have a
[SPEAKER_06]: better day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it sounds like coffee is ready in the
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coffee and bong ribs.
[SPEAKER_08]: No coffee for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: More of a tea kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: This fresh frozen is absolutely white.
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells like candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't believe the nice smell on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be wasting that
goodness.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super stoked on hitting your fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_04]: cartons.
It's a good rip in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: More sativa with the cushion in so it's
got the really zing lech but that nice
[SPEAKER_07]: cushy taste in the back that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, um, a winner.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wants to smoke, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's smoke it then.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those never-ending hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: The taste on this, I cannot even describe
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fruity overtones with these things I never
taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stinks in the throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminded me of one of my viewers just
now when I looked at your face.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my viewers said, I love how the
grower is so proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: John is proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do enjoy growing good medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I enjoy smoking good medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I enjoy people who grow good medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoy teaching people how to grow good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you enjoy teaching people how to make
great medicine from what they grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hence that's why I have this marvelous
fresh frozen here.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of education and we got
formal dry sift and stepped it up a notch
[SPEAKER_07]: to fresh frozen which is, uh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely putting the music down a little
bit so we can be heard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how loud that was in the
background but I figured I'd turn it down
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, pretty excited to make bubble up
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've made it in a house before.
[SPEAKER_08]: A good friend of mine used to,
well, he might still have the house.
[SPEAKER_08]: He used to, just back in the day when herb
was quite expensive, he would buy half
[SPEAKER_08]: pounds of, um, rennet and just run it
right in the bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty expensive back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Close to fifteen hundred for a half pound.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, today we're going to do the fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it that we've got down again?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we've mentioned the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, tell them a little bit about My Little
Pony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what are the strains that were used
to create My Little Pony?
[SPEAKER_07]: My Little Pony was, um, some genetics that
was, um, grandfathered me through a friend
[SPEAKER_07]: of mine and, uh, he gave me some nice
elite beans and, um, I took those to a
[SPEAKER_07]: prayer medicinal cup of 2012 and won third
place for Bubba Chem.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, he gave you seeds that you cracked and
it was Bubba Chem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then so, perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, then you took that Bubba Chem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had, I had it with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that Skunk Haze came from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, unknown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark 92, 93, SH and I have a lot of
different beans over the years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been, um, playing in public seats
since the mid-80s.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, it's really unknown.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like SH.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't even say Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I could tell what it was growing
right away and I remember what it was and
[SPEAKER_07]: the beans that I got in the mid-90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just that time of year and they
went into a bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually have some video footage of
me popping these beans and them taped
[SPEAKER_07]: inside of my box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barney's this.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Diesel, Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so it came from Barney's.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's just other stuff I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had so many different seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one, you can see the bag and it's
right, it's just a little bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says SH in black 92.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love to find the history of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, while smoking it for the first
time, the gentleman there is where I got
[SPEAKER_07]: the beans from.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're laughing and like, it smells like My
Little Pony.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we joked about it and there's three of
us in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we went to T.Y., we, uh,
well, I actually started saying that to
[SPEAKER_07]: people that what we call the My Little
Pony and people love the name and they
[SPEAKER_07]: close their eyes and smell it and like,
yeah, it smells like my, it's such a
[SPEAKER_07]: fruity tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, um, we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is, where is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: We should go and smoke some.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just about to load up a dab of the
OG, but, uh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nine beat right on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I made on Christmas day,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a half hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely some smoke in there for
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, uh, I will always pay attention
to your tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know what you're leaving behind,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just enough to heat this up and give it a
wipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also fine with the real,
real melty stuff, especially dry sift.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got your hit on the pan on the
little scooper and you hold it above the D
[SPEAKER_08]: now for too long, the resin melts almost
immediately onto the spoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you've actually got to like press
it against the center piece rather than
[SPEAKER_08]: drop it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer dropping it if I can,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I like to hold it up a little
bit too sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was, um, Christmas Eve.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had made my, cut myself down a Christmas
present and I put this into the freezer
[SPEAKER_07]: and did a run of my little pony,
Kush, for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I don't have a chance to see
Marco over the holidays, I went up almost
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to make another batch that
we can really puff it down hard because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's not that much left.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of felt bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're smoking it right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to be in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to try and find a good place
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure where it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to find this amazing place
today and you guys are going to love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I suspect so as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be the first of many,
as long as I can procure, um, material.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next batch we'll do will be up in
Whistler somewhere on the back country.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll build a little igloo and we'll do
everything up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that we'll go to Pemberton
ice caps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, John and I are going to finish our
breakfast rips here and we'll get back to
[SPEAKER_08]: you really soon with some bubble making.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, a little bit rainy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go look for a water source.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to make it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey John.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it all packed up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got all our shit packed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, uh, grab, uh, grab the Marlin Asher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget the CV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are out of here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick breakfast.
[SPEAKER_08]: South side diner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like you got one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bon appétit, John.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a belch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a scramble.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're filming our little session here that
we've stopped in at, uh, with Phil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, it's pre, we haven't gone to make
the bubble yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're thinking of going up the Chequemus.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just went up Cadenwood.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was snowing at about a thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, yeah, we figured we'd stop and
have a quick session here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I should introduce, uh,
Devin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Devin's a friend of mine that I do a lot
of snowboarding with and back country
[SPEAKER_08]: sledding with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Phil, who's kind of out of
camera, he can lean in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another local whistler, uh, ganja
aficionado, cannabinoid intake lover.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, John B and Oreo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oreo's in the video today.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my little point.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you, that's flirting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I check my nuts out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking rates.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's raining right now in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: Down in the valley anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure where we're going to make
this bubble.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a feeling it's going to be
Chequemus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chequemus, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which for you that don't know,
that's a function junction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Function.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to see you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to see you in a person.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get pony.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, you're getting what everyone
else is getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pony.
[SPEAKER_07]: One sec, one sec.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just kind of cut that out of my
hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Carb cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Carb cap, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Couple of quick rips before we go do a
little adventuring.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to drive up the Chequemus River
and find a nice spot where the snow is
[SPEAKER_08]: falling, where the rains turn to snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Freezing level.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, hopefully we'll be able to get a
quick batch done up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think with the four of us, we should be
able to, you know, have a couple of guys
[SPEAKER_08]: pull two bags each.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can pull two bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can pull two bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can pull two bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can pull a bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll just each literally have enough
spoons and enough presses and screens that
[SPEAKER_08]: the bubble can... I've never actually done
a batch where you could almost pull all
[SPEAKER_08]: the bubble out at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rather than one guy pulling a bag at a
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never thought seven guys,
each, we each just pull the bag right
[SPEAKER_08]: away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scoop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like out in one shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be, uh... Preserving those
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Preserving the turps.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keeping them less in the water for those
water soluble turpinoids we were talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to give me a carb cap?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's taken a couple of days to try
and make this bubble, but I think we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to get it done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I cut it down New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_07]: New Year's Eve?
[SPEAKER_07]: New Year's Eve is the one that came down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to make a fresh bubble on New
Year's Day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I kind of wanted to make it with
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, now we'll move on to the high
knees.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's knees.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you always put lids back on?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I've got lids over.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just explaining to the people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You always put your lids back on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You always put your lids back on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone park them just right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you don't pull them over.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to smell that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's... Dude, that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking A-Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Simply put.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking A-Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking A-Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells like candy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking rights it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take the first rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks way bigger than it is because
it's so... That's what she's... That's
[SPEAKER_07]: what she's... This is a new strain that
I've done.
Sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to watch this melt,
but... That smells great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the best thing about Maddie Hayes is
that in the beginning you do that zing and
[SPEAKER_07]: the flavor in the end is just so,
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're trying to name the flavor,
and it's... It's like a... I would say
[SPEAKER_07]: more like a fruit liqueur.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is that small haze on the... In
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little bit... I'll open your
tongue a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of tell it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were saying last night,
there's a little bit of that haze that's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually present there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The salivation factor is kind of imminent.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 120 is, I always say, is the most
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a more small component?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that ever just the most candy-rific
taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like a fresh nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like a fresh nut itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oreo wants to smell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because there's valuable heads just
on the lid, that's why.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a reasonable request,
John, to keep the lid on your full-melt
[SPEAKER_08]: hash, particularly when people are looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the lid back on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way when you knock it over,
a couple of minutes later when you're too
[SPEAKER_08]: high, it's just a mild second of
uncomfortableness instead of... Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just dropped.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three months worth of work and everything
that I've been doing for the last three
[SPEAKER_07]: months all over the floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now full of fibers and you're just
going to do what with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe rewash it, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe throw it back into a bag and try to
get that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd probably go with tweezers.
[SPEAKER_08]: With this amount, I'd probably get a
couple of tools, one like this,
[SPEAKER_08]: one like a tweezer, and my little eye-loop
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like it's a pound of it that you
wouldn't be able to do, but... How's that
[SPEAKER_08]: hitting you, Phil?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just steamroll it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, we have to make my little pony
bubble hash today up on the Chief of Mist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, it's funny how this name is actually
sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be step one of getting into
making bubble in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, we'll do it on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of with a group,
barbecue, people doing a little fire,
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting dark out so we can put a nice
bright light in the igloo and make it
[SPEAKER_08]: glow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the really cool way to get it
done would be that the whole reason to do
[SPEAKER_08]: it would be for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If everyone was on the side, where are we
going to do it?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a couple of good spots that we
can go and build.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good people that'll help out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It smells like freaking candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always a good time to be had in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that smells just lovely.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because of this D now, the way it
just releases out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: The perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: The time you put something on this thing,
it's just like, where's your old joke
[SPEAKER_07]: about that purple light?
[SPEAKER_07]: My hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some nice stuff in here too.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's that tasty from last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then this, this one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the boxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the pressing screens.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is watermelon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the Mellie?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to save one more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that stuff is just, that's candy,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: That smells like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have candy.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how I roll.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone wants to do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm liking the treasure box, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All different flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's packed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's got something good in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's got a lovely pink piece of paper
to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the number four.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that now?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pre-98.
[SPEAKER_07]: So look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just played with that a little bit.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's quite, what screen is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that'll be 90 mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, before I put this in my container,
I'd like to hand it back to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like fucking candy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here, John, if you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really John?
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the dabber for that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty tasty, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this needs to be seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: My camera isn't self-focused.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's retarded.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you have a quarter pound of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember I left that quarter pound at your
house?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think it's down in the truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep leaving weed line, but that's what
I left line over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do a video dry-sifting
probably the next puff one, that quarter
[SPEAKER_07]: pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we found some buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: People like to see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get some nice macro photographs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sign in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sign me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nominees are?
[SPEAKER_08]: The nominees are for best rip of the year
2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was just doing the small
hitters.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of those other ones you were hitting
huge rips.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were just packing giant ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took one that I thought was big,
and then you loaded him one even bigger
[SPEAKER_08]: and dumped it in the middle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you loaded him another one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, damn, we're puffing tough
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's puffed up?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always nice when the...
[SPEAKER_08]: Rips are plenty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, at this point in time, you probably
noticed from the start of the video that
[SPEAKER_08]: John and I have shorter hair.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is true that we got all stoned and
ended up going and cutting our hair.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seemed like the good thing to do at the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, now that that's been said,
how's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tasty?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably like, I don't know,
about a year old now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you had at TY last year?
[SPEAKER_09]: Each year.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you had some really, really nice
hair last year at TY.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming around.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the best thing is that it never
kinks.
[SPEAKER_07]: 753, we were talking about that
temperature yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not worried about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of just even bring it closer.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason to even have it back
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really nothing too great.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, with the wood box, I feel even safer
with it, but I haven't dropped it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rubber feet make it so it doesn't
slide in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like even like when it's on glass or
a surface, I'd actually have to lift it
[SPEAKER_08]: up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would never even be able to pull it
towards me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it's just stuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that on my desk as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you even need to ask?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was lovely.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Load yourself one up, I'll take the last
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: What'd you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said load yourself one up, I'll take the
last, the last hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: As it should be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say that your cure is doing a pretty
good job of that now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it really changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's much more sedative.
[SPEAKER_09]: Much heavier.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure some of the THC's turn to CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty medicinal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_08]: From smoking, fresh frozen, it was cut
down very recently, and now we're even
[SPEAKER_08]: smoking and it's still quite recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been in it for a month anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to something that's been chilling
for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: This stuff was also, the material was dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And dried for almost six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that extra one from behind for you,
cause I think that big one, first one,
[SPEAKER_07]: you got Rob somewhere along the lines,
so we're gonna do that last one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I'm feeling bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bonus round.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, we were talking about this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he wants the bonus round.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: The carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: So deep, different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So completely different.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like one was a meal and one
was a dessert.
[SPEAKER_08]: One lighter, heavier.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one was a dessert.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so just delicious and candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh my god, it was exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one was definitely more like,
serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little more serious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one's about the sativa and
that's more uplifting.
[SPEAKER_08]: They settle right in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the watermelon is usually a racy
hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very, it's very like, this gives
people anxiety.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does, truly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally, but now it's a year old and it's
acting differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm convinced it has to do with the
modulating effects of the terpias being
[SPEAKER_08]: affected by their volatility.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that they're evaporating and
changing more so than the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_08]: are, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, from my own.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to go extract some
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some fresh bud that's sitting in the
cooler.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's go do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do that.
All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going.
We're going.
