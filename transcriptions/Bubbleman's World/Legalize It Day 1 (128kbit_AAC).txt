[SPEAKER_16]: Hey guys, welcome to bubble man's world
been a while since I posted a video
[SPEAKER_16]: actually But today I had to post one
because this is the last day before Canada
[SPEAKER_16]: legalizes cannabis recreationally Now a
lot of you may know that I have had a mmar
[SPEAKER_16]: license a federal exemption from the
government since 2011 2012 Sorry,
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm out of breath.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just literally ran up from my truck Need
to catch my breath And also pretty excited
[SPEAKER_16]: about this.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know a lot of people are still you know,
calling it prohibition 2.0 They're they're
[SPEAKER_16]: bashing on it.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're saying that all the laws are
worse.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're Absolutely not happy with the way
things are playing out at all.
[SPEAKER_16]: I on the other hand see this as a great
step forward more access for people
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, we still have to fight for
dispensaries and we still have to fight
[SPEAKER_16]: for different products like edibles and
concentrates But this is pretty big news
[SPEAKER_16]: in Canada Legalization up to four plants
everyone in the country can grow We're
[SPEAKER_16]: allowed to carry 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're allowed to smoke outside the airport
We're allowed to smoke at campgrounds and
[SPEAKER_16]: any public place where you can smoke
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're allowed to smoke It's a pretty big
deal from someone like myself who for 30
[SPEAKER_16]: years has been fighting the prohibition
machine And you know watching a lot of my
[SPEAKER_16]: friends get arrested and having their
lives ruined myself included having been
[SPEAKER_16]: arrested and having gone through the court
systems and it's just a huge Huge relief
[SPEAKER_16]: to seeing it come to fruition tonight at
1201 a.m It's October 16th right now and
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually going to be heading over to
Victoria to party at the Pachu Pachu party
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got like a couple of special
guests I think one is Tommy Chong and the
[SPEAKER_16]: other is the actor-rapper ludicrous Let's
see what that's all about Mostly I'm
[SPEAKER_16]: excited for to go see my team embark.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the first time the entire team is
going to be together that's my extract lab
[SPEAKER_16]: that I've been working on in Delta and
We've rented a beautiful home.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can imagine a team of 12 to 15
people 200 plus dollars a night at a
[SPEAKER_16]: hotel.
[SPEAKER_16]: We ended up renting this really beautiful
epic house on a 43 acre property.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got a helipad and It's got I don't
know seven or eight bedrooms and it's just
[SPEAKER_16]: really like spectacular You guys are gonna

may be jumping on a float plane from
[SPEAKER_16]: downtown Vancouver and we're gonna be
flying into downtown Victoria in which
[SPEAKER_16]: case I'll jump in a cab and head over to
the house after that but Super excited
[SPEAKER_16]: figured I might as well take a quick dab

Canada for at least the last hundred years

continue to film throughout the rest of
[SPEAKER_16]: the day here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here on Day 1 and celebrate a little bit
of a party.
[SPEAKER_16]: Try to show you guys as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, today we have rented a party bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're taking the party bus into
Victoria.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_16]: Party bus.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this the party bus?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this the party bus?
[SPEAKER_10]: Party bus.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have to worry about clothing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All I had to worry about was what book was
I going to read and what song I was going
[SPEAKER_10]: to write.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also got to thank Canada for a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to thank Canada for Cheech.
[SPEAKER_10]: I met Cheech in Vancouver because he was
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hiding from the war in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_10]: He came up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Canada means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it gave me my attitude that got me
where I am today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if it wasn't for We... Hey,
let's have a nice round of applause with
[SPEAKER_10]: this dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is a cool guy, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like him.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheech was hiding from the Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_10]: Canada took him in.
[SPEAKER_10]: He became almost a landed immigrant in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then when we got together and I found
out that we could be funny, there was only
[SPEAKER_10]: one place we had to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was down in the States to make it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so Cheech was the first Mexican to
sneak into the States from Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he'd be here today, but he's hiding
from Donald Trump because Trump wants to
[SPEAKER_10]: deport his ass.
[SPEAKER_10]: But while we were down there, being
Canadian really helped me with my career.
[SPEAKER_10]: It did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because no matter what we did down there,
it was nothing compared to working up in
[SPEAKER_10]: this motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had the worst jobs you could possibly
have because I dropped out of school.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as I spoke my first joint,
I said, fuck it, I'm done with school.
[SPEAKER_10]: I became a roofer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I became a truck driver.
[SPEAKER_10]: I dug ditches.
[SPEAKER_10]: I dug ditches for the telephone company.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had all the shit jobs that you could
possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when Cheech and I went down and
found out that we could make a buck being
[SPEAKER_10]: funny and smoking weed and getting paid,
that's what we did, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a Canadian attitude that got me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right where I am today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I've been doing interviews all day
today because of the weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they want to know what my favorite
strain is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they always say, the weed today
is a lot better than it was back then.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, back then and today is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Only bad weed is no weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you don't have to smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all in your mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: It affects the brain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I was in jail, I never smoked a
joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never touched it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I got high every night just thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it does.
[SPEAKER_10]: It affects the brain.
[SPEAKER_10]: If your drone's in for a weed and you
don't have it, just get quiet and remember
[SPEAKER_10]: what it was like when you were high.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you will get that contact tie.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will come back to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does to me all the time, anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the way here, I tried to think of
something special because of the
[SPEAKER_10]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I started writing this song.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just got the last part of the song
done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's the Canadian anthem.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to sing it to you now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if I remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wrote it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Canada, glorious and free.
[SPEAKER_10]: You set the stage for all the world to
see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Canada, you legalize all the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are weed.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is post prohibition street dabs with
what was your name again?
[SPEAKER_16]: With what was your name again?
[SPEAKER_13]: Alice.
[SPEAKER_16]: With Alice from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_13]: And Flav.
[SPEAKER_13]: And fucking Johnny fucking B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny fucking B.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing airport dabs years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sitting on the side of the street,
having dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's worried because we're loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're smoking weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's smoking weed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Dana Larson's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the back of Dana Larson's head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Famous Canadian activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the back of his head right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just shaking it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Say hi to us on post prohibition day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Legalized it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the new slogan I'm trying out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Much civil disobedience to still practice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Love the idea of the psilocybin mushroom
stores.
[SPEAKER_13]: And fucking keep doing what you're doing,
brother.
[SPEAKER_13]: I support it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to say a word.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it all already.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Paint me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dueling dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_13]: is going to chas my bowl up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like, I see that says 17.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going to chas my bowl up.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got the timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: 26.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_10]: How long you got to heat that up for?
[SPEAKER_10]: 46?
[SPEAKER_10]: How much more time do you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you hitting red hot dabs like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here on whatever street with a
couple of hot dabbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, here, here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny B.
[SPEAKER_11]: hitting dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, here comes the police,

Run.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's post-prohibition.
Don't do it.
Don't fucking do it.
Don't fucking do it.
Don't fucking do it.
Don't fucking do it.
Don't fucking do it.
