[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ethan, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all hear each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't hear you, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought I heard something there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen,
apologies for the technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of a bit of a problem today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure that we're live here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in Whistler, British Columbia on my
laptop computer, and it's not being quite
[SPEAKER_05]: as generous as my home computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of technical difficulties,
but I can hear you guys now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure the YouTube
channels live as the other chat room is
[SPEAKER_05]: not really working for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may need to get one of you guys to help
says live.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm recording it under this computer
so then I can put it onto the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that I want to
make sure the people that were in the
[SPEAKER_05]: original room are able to see this room
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got people in the chat room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Skunkman Sam in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Robert Connell Clark, Dr. Mark
Sheldone and Dr. Ethan Russo for a little
[SPEAKER_05]: special impromptu gathering to celebrate
and remember the life of Raphael Mashulam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, great Israeli scientists done some
amazing work in our field and I myself
[SPEAKER_05]: have only met him on a few occasions,
but I'm sure some of the folks in the room
[SPEAKER_05]: have some different stories to tell as
well as just people who have studied his
[SPEAKER_05]: work and used his work like Dr. Mark over
the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we are golden here,
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, thank you all for showing up
on a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sure it's not Sunday morning for
all of you, but on a Sunday morning for at
[SPEAKER_05]: least a few of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Dr. Ethan?
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: A specific coasters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your trip to Peru, by the way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a very nice Can America
conference in Quito for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I spent a week in the rainforest
with my daughter, Sarah, and my business
[SPEAKER_02]: partner, Nisha Whiteley, and a friend of
hers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looked spectacular.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Nisha's photography.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I saw a little bit of the stuff you
guys like staring at giant snakes on the
[SPEAKER_05]: side of the on the riverbanks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked pretty wild.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we got some folks in the room here
linking up with us to hear about Rafi
[SPEAKER_05]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the idea, by the way,
Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's crazy how the hash churches
just turned into like a gathering for
[SPEAKER_05]: people that we have lost in the last
little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of that sort of going
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I'll never forget Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he was probably in his 50s when he
told me this, but he said more of my
[SPEAKER_05]: friends are dying now than I'm making
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was still like in my 30s and
thought, well, that's a weird statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now as I approach 50 at the end of the
month here, March 31st, I'll be 50 years
[SPEAKER_05]: old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say it's very accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to be losing more friends than I'm
making friends these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that's the the way life goes
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it goes for mentors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot left, I'm afraid,
at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can imagine that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we all, you know, if you're lucky,
you get older.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say that because my father passed
away at a very young age.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was only 55 years old and his wife was
older.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was only 49 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I hear people complaining about
getting older.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, oh, this and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a walk in the park anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, but you're lucky if you're
getting older.
[SPEAKER_05]: So try to remember that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than the alternative,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not getting older, you're dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think so personally,
I think that there's the random person
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't think that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like to stay positive and think
that, yeah, it's good to stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to stay on the on the upside.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Rob?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your birthday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be I'm going to turn 70 in the
beginning of May.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you had one recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all around the same time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, spring kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, life is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm in Amsterdam at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I continuing to try to move out of my
apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen this summer,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all packed up pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved in here exactly 30 years ago on
this coming April 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gets the place?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess everybody or gets it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he's happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll get it and remodel it if it'll never
be the ghetto that it is ever again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, lots of good times in that
apartment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll miss that apartment myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've had a great bunch of times here
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked when I read my lease a few
months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd lived here for more than 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said to myself, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a number on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like 22 or 23, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got the lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, holy shit, 29 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time flies when you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just not something that really
exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: That much in North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leasing a place for 30 years that you live
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leased in rented houses for 20 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was lucky if I got four years and I
didn't have to move again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just constantly forced into
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I thought I was going to live in any
one city for this long, I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: bought an apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty stupid to have rented it for
so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never really thought I was going to
stay here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I didn't consciously hang here
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, that's what goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the chat's doing for me
right now, but when I punch anything into
[SPEAKER_05]: the chat, no one replies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be a little bit rough trying to
communicate with the folks that are
[SPEAKER_05]: watching right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does say that we have a couple hundred
people in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just the speed of my
computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee it's on my side, not anything
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's unfortunate because I usually
like to pay attention to the chat and
[SPEAKER_05]: engage with the people who are watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you'll have to do that,
Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll relay anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it was 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 2015.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Dr. Ethan would remember better than
I would.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, the one and only real time
that I actually spent time with with Rafi
[SPEAKER_05]: was at the International Cannabinoid
Research event in Leiden, Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the one in Leiden, Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it 2018 or 2014?
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it in a different place every
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of hard to remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where I got the photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I used as the avatar for this
particular hash church.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just approached him and kind of gave
my respects and said it was really cool,
[SPEAKER_05]: the work that he had done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that had a small conversation with him
and managed to get that photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so obviously, his work was profound in
what we do and everything that we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought it would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Mark really thought it would be a
good idea to gather and to join all the
[SPEAKER_05]: fellows that are here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Sam and Rob had hored a farm for
years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure their paths must have crossed
with, at least with Rafi's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you probably met him multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you did as well, Dr. Ethan
Russo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we could tell some stories of how
you guys met and some of the interactions
[SPEAKER_05]: that you had over the years and maybe how
his work impacted the work that you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: would have done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to get this YouTube chat going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need somebody to lead off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, any one of you guys are welcome to
lead off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super loose, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I appreciate this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think possibly we should rename this
hash temple in his memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to plug for Shango Los and I
recorded an episode of Shaping Fire on
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday and it's already posted as of
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Shaping Fire, if you look for that,
we've got about an hour and 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be supplemental to what we do here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew of Rafi's work for many years
before I actually met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was already working in the
cannabis space for three years when I met
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same time I met Rob and David for the
first time in Acapulco in 1999 at the ICRS
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we established a good rapport pretty
much immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: He recognized my name as one that could
have been Israeli and turned out he was
[SPEAKER_02]: born with Sephardic Jewish family in
Sofia, Bulgaria in 1930.
[SPEAKER_02]: My family came from nearby in Macedonia,
a town called Monastir, now called Bitola.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I was getting a certain credibility
by being a physician in a space where it
[SPEAKER_02]: was mainly bench scientists and renegades
like Rob and Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the composition of ICRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we certainly, his work heavily
influenced me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, we worked together quite
extensively at GW Pharmaceuticals between
[SPEAKER_02]: 2003 and 2014 when I was senior medical
advisor there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was attending the annual meetings,
research meetings where it was decided
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of work would be done on the
various phyto-cannabinoids, whether it be
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the work on CBD was initiated
there, mostly among European scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tallied it up the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were together at one meeting or another
ICRS or the International Association for
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoid Medicine meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was heavily involved in clinical work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between those, we were together in 14
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really fortunate to be able to
share many a meal with him and his
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful wife, Dahlia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a close relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I have stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorites was somewhere around
2008, we were meeting in London and he
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to introduce me to your Gertrude I
already knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said something along the lines of,
this is my friend, Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said, he has many crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, that was a high compliment and
I've always bragged about it ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also really pleased in 2005,
his last book was released and he had
[SPEAKER_02]: asked me to write the first book or
chapter of that on cannabis in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'll always remember for
bragging rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll let people go around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could certainly talk about all the
scientific developments that he
[SPEAKER_02]: spearheaded or in which he was involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of reading the chat here.
[SPEAKER_05]: One question from the chat was,
can Ethan explain the distinction for
[SPEAKER_05]: Raphael being credited with discovering or
isolating cannabinoids, please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this had a real history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the 19th century, chemists around
the world were trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_02]: the active ingredients were in
psychoactive plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had great success with the opium
poppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found morphine somewhere around 1804,
also cocaine from coca leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But working on cannabis, they were sort of
stumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could get it down to this red oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in 1896 isolated what they call
cannabinol, but it wasn't pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequently, Loewe in the United States
after being a refugee from Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of had the structure of cannabidiol
in 1940.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't until Raffi and his
associates, Gioni and Schwo, 1963,
[SPEAKER_02]: kneeled down the three-dimensional
structure of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the next year in 64,
they isolated and synthesized
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrahydrocannabinol, known to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That same year, they isolated cannabigerol
and had depressions to note that it seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the parent compound of the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that same year, they found the real
parents, the cannabinoid acids,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA, CBGA, CBNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 66, they found cannabichromine
and went on from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, people could argue that
cannabidiol was discovered by Loewe
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, but- Roger Adams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roger Adams was the first one to isolate
cannabidiol from Minnesota wildhound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's who you're referring to,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loewe was working the cannabinoid field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Adams, Roger Adams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stand corrected there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it went on from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Raffi's work never stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the discovery of the CB1 cannabinoid
receptor in 1988 and 90, they isolated a
[SPEAKER_02]: nanoparticle of the cannabinoid,
the first endocannabinoid, that work done
[SPEAKER_02]: with Bill DeVane and Lumiere Hanouche.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few years later, they found
two-arachidonal glycerol, 2AG,
[SPEAKER_02]: in 1995 and went on from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that addresses the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always one person in the chat
making sure that the history is accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got Steve from Potent Ponics just
left, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I trust that Dr. Ethan Russo knows the
history.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, you'd love to know, I mean,
how many people who just think that he was
[SPEAKER_04]: the first to discover THC and he was the
first to isolate THC when we all know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Raffi, he referenced all this work
very accurately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humbly in his papers, back to the woods,
bivy, Easterfield isolation that you
[SPEAKER_04]: reference in 1896, where the first folks
to isolate, you know, distilled
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids, the first people to make
distill it, I guess you'd say,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was really Robert Sidney Kahn
in four back-to-back papers in the early
[SPEAKER_04]: 30s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the thing that was confusing them is
that back in the day, this was before
[SPEAKER_04]: spectroscopy and before all this
analytical instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they often would do is they would
perform chemical reactions on these
[SPEAKER_04]: natural extracts to try to identify the
product of these chemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes they would be treating with
like concentrated nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, that was one of the three
derivatives that the Wood Spivy
[SPEAKER_04]: Easterfield group made.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I believe it was Spivy was
actually killed in an explosion in the
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory during some of that work when
they were working with that really
[SPEAKER_04]: explosive nitration chemistry,
the same thing that killed one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: people in the DuPont family that was
making nitrates for explosives.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this chemistry was often just very
harsh and would tear up these molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times, like when you think of
heroin, heroin's the acetate, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would make these derivatives
and sometimes be able to purify these
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical derivatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, I know there's been a lot of
interest in THC acetate these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was actually one of the typical
derivatizations that they would do when
[SPEAKER_04]: they isolated a compound that had a free
OH or a free phenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Wood and Spivy and Easterfield carried
out enough detective work in their
[SPEAKER_04]: original work to know that there was a
free phenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why they named the compound
cannabinol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a mixture of compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at their boiling points
and you plot their boiling points on
[SPEAKER_04]: something called a nomograph, which
corrects for the vacuum pressure at which
[SPEAKER_04]: that fraction is collected under vacuum,
it corrects it for the boiling point at a
[SPEAKER_04]: standard pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And often when boiling points were
reported, and you know this Ethan,
[SPEAKER_04]: because some of these are in some of your
own papers, it often got reported as this
[SPEAKER_04]: is the boiling point of THC, but they
forgot to mention that it was measured
[SPEAKER_04]: under this vacuum pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the boiling point at atmospheric
pressure was much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is, is that if you look at
the boiling point of what Wood,
[SPEAKER_04]: Spivy and Easterfield isolated,
it is smack on the boiling point of what
[SPEAKER_04]: Rafi isolated several years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that I think is the nail in the
coffin that those people did indeed
[SPEAKER_04]: isolate THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably a mixture of the ring
isomers, Delta A, Delta 9, who knows,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now we're going to quibble about
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have to give credit to the Czechs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, speaking to Lumiere Hanus,
it's apparent that a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: work was accomplished earlier in the 50s
on these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was because of Soviet influence or
communist influence, it was published in
[SPEAKER_02]: Czech and was never accessible to people
in other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be that as it may, Rafi got the
credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly with these other substances,
he was the clear winner, with most of them
[SPEAKER_02]: at least, in isolating them and helping to
figure out what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he had proton NMR, which just was
invented in the early 60s that Roger Adams
[SPEAKER_04]: and the previous chemists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Rafi would totally admit that
he stood on the shoulders of Adams and
[SPEAKER_04]: Rangel and all those people, Khan and
everybody who came before him,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think there was always ambiguity
over the position of the double bond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, if you look at some of Roger Adams'
papers from 1940, you'll see that he
[SPEAKER_04]: represents tetrahydrocannabinol with just
the double bond in either Delta 7 or Delta
[SPEAKER_04]: 6.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an odd position because they had
no clue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is during the war,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing that that work was even done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was the first one that
hydrogenated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he hydrogenated THC that they isolated
from conversion of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he talked about the acid catalyzed
conversion of CBD over into THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogenated it to make HHC and then
padded it, claiming a compound with
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana-like activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always thought it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in the lab must have tried it,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Chemistry chuckle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate the stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of people in chat talking about this
hydrogenated cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's got lots to say about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really impactful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Ethan said, when you lose a mentor,
because mentors have this incredible
[SPEAKER_04]: impact on the community because they've
mentored scientists who've gone on to be
[SPEAKER_04]: mentors themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like a chemical family
connection that you have back to your
[SPEAKER_04]: mentor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never met Professor Mishra.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to show him, but we
corresponded quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the time I became an active chemist
in cannabis chemistry, he wasn't taking
[SPEAKER_04]: any more collaborations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think he found great interest in
what I was doing and some of the ideas and
[SPEAKER_04]: counseled me and sent me all kinds of
papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he enjoyed his fame in a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think he kind of understood that
there were chemists like me and other
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists throughout the world that have
now jumped in feet first into cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: science, mostly based on his inspiration
and his story.
[SPEAKER_04]: His story is just incredible, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, it's a story about the war.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a story about Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a story about how the NIH told them
to go pound salt until the director from
[SPEAKER_04]: NIH went over there and he grabbed a bunch
of THC and brought it back to Bethesda.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the world's supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can elaborate on that a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rafi would tell the story that when he
first applied to NIH, as Mark said,
[SPEAKER_02]: they turned him down and the explanation
was, well, nobody uses cannabis in this
[SPEAKER_02]: country, which obviously wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tune changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the son of a senator got
busted for, quote, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the senator was worried that this
would make him crazy forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly he had funding and he had funding
through NIH for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's true that NIH asked for the total
synthesized supply of THC, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: something like 25 grams at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kept coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it meant more hashish had to be
processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, this was seized from
police supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the hashish got there was interesting
too, because it was grown in Lebanon and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'd be thrown over the barbed wire fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably there was an exchange of money
involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just was in Barcelona and I met some
Lebanese gentlemen and they gave me the
[SPEAKER_05]: most beautiful piece of red Lebanese hash
I've seen in a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like what we were seeing in the
70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's all traditional cultivars,
traditional methodologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're younger guys, but they're
following, you know, the tradition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just great.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I really loved about it was,
you know, simultaneously there was a
[SPEAKER_05]: woman, we were at HQ in Barcelona,
my friend David's club.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in this sort of upstairs private
area that, you know, shout out to Frenchy
[SPEAKER_05]: Canole, because the last time I got to
spend time with Frenchy and smoke with
[SPEAKER_05]: Frenchy was at HQ in this very spot where
I met these Lebanese gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was there at HQ.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the end of the event.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I landed at the event, I was a judge
for masters of rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the masters of rosin was a competition
with 64 entries and basically half a gram
[SPEAKER_05]: per entry for the judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was 32 grams of live hash rosin that
was given to me as I landed at the airport
[SPEAKER_05]: in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half an hour later, I had all this raw
live hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was giving out the last little
jars, little quarter grams, little tenth
[SPEAKER_05]: of grams, just to the people in HQ.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first group that I approached were
these guys from Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually Armenian and Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they pulled out this Lebanese hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, come on up to this little private
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try smoking some.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a girl up there with John
Berfalo who works for a company called
[SPEAKER_05]: Flute, F-L-U-T-T, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of these cups that sits on a
base and vaporizes the smoke into the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you drink the vapor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd tried a few before and wasn't
impressed with them at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this unit was unbelievable and how
effective it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this Lebanese hash was very melty.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a hash kettle that we tried to make
a snake out and put it into the hash
[SPEAKER_05]: kettle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when my buddy lit it, it just was
dripping and melting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a very nice kettle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great caliber of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this cup was the perfect way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just put it into the little coil,
very much like a Puffco or a Carta or any
[SPEAKER_05]: of these units.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she put the cup on the base and it
filled up super psychedelically with this
[SPEAKER_05]: really neat smoky vapor right to the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I, I, I swigged it down and I just
had to say like from taking the moon rides
[SPEAKER_05]: with the live hash rosin, you know,
the rocket ship to the moon, every hit you
[SPEAKER_05]: take, I was very impressed with the flavor
and the, and the, the effects of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Lebanese hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just very, very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that a lot of people that are
smoking these very pure full melts and
[SPEAKER_05]: live hash rosins would have an
appreciation if they could access product
[SPEAKER_05]: like that and be able to smoke it in a
very particular way that still made it
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The high was completely different in every
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just, it made me appreciate that
traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, you know, it was done very
well, as you can even just see from the
[SPEAKER_05]: pictures, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a COA on that material?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no COA that I, you know,
these were just a couple of dudes that had
[SPEAKER_05]: it, but I'm in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've invited me to Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've told them that I would love to go
there and bring some hash making
[SPEAKER_05]: techniques and maybe learn some
traditional hash making techniques.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm going to keep the connection
with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very excited and just very gung-ho
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just couldn't believe the caliber of
hash that they had from Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was shocking to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can step in with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first met Dr. Mishulam in 1993,
when I joined the, at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the International Cannabis Research
Society, later changed to the Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I went to the Toronto meeting of
the ICRS in 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the first one I attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was their fourth of 33
meetings that they've had so far yearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked Dr. Mishulam from the first time
we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: His love of cannabis, the cannabinoids and
the endocannabinoid system and his belief
[SPEAKER_00]: in their importance to medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that both of us really
shared deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind enough to help my cannabis R&D
company, the first company licensed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world to do research and development with
cannabis and grow and breed cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: He participated in the filming of a
documentary by a Dutch science program,
[SPEAKER_00]: Norder Light, broadcast on Dutch TV in the
mid-90s about the future of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt very strongly about it,
the cannabinoids and endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they filmed Rafi walking through my
one acre greenhouse in Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling the individual plants and talking
to the Northern Light film crew and
[SPEAKER_00]: several other people who were interviewing
him on the film.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, many people in the
government, government authorities,
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and doctors included,
really did not believe cannabis had a
[SPEAKER_00]: future in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it did, as Dr. Mishulam of course
knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He visited my home with his wife,
Dalia, and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner
[SPEAKER_00]: with my wife had prepared for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to send my condolences to Dr.
Mishulam and Dalia, their three children,
[SPEAKER_00]: Roy, Hadass and Daphnia, as well as Dr.
Mishulam had seven grandchildren,
[SPEAKER_00]: aged between seven and 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope they will have a truly
wonderful life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope Rafi rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rafi truly was the center, like a
spiderweb of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid researchers worldwide,
cannabis cannabinoid, endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was endless in his advice and hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we helped a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to show that terpenes were
able to potentiate and modulate THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really a pot grower or cannabis
grower, but we reached as far as we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved Rafi and I'll miss him
greatly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nicely said, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nicely said indeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to gather with you guys on a
Sunday morning dash afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dash evening in Amsterdam for Rob and Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been doing Hash Church every
week by any means, but it's nice that it
[SPEAKER_05]: exists and it's a place and it's a
platform that if we ever do want to
[SPEAKER_05]: gather, if we want to celebrate a lost
soldier or we want to just gather and
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoy the plant that we love so much,
it's always here for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll always make it available.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going on its ninth year for
Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_05]: So doesn't that make you feel old?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy how as you get older,
you can just gather decades behind you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just decades of like, oh, how many
decades?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Rob, I thought I lived here for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, it's been 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a whole extra decade that you sort of
missed there, but it happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I just got my little guy
talking in the background here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably mute it out if someone else
wants to go into a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like to say a couple other
things if I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rafi was a real international character
and he easily could have gotten mixed up
[SPEAKER_02]: in the politics rather than the science
related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in 2002, I had a research project in
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were looking at how cannabis affected
night vision, in which it improves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I was a little bit concerned
there, but I was fascinated to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: Rafi was revered in the science community
in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody asked me about it and they knew
that I knew him and just constant
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and the respect was so obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we met in 1999, I wondered what his
relationship was with Mahmoud El-Salih,
[SPEAKER_02]: who of course runs the cannabis farm at
the University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was Egyptian by birth, but they've been
colleagues forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, politics never entered
into their relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, Rafi had Palestinian
scientists in his lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly need more of that kind of
attitude in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had asked him about Israeli politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, the fundamentalists, gee whiz,
they seem to be taking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, I don't know, 10 years ago or
even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, yeah, well, we need to separate
the church from the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, religion from the state,
but he says the right-wingers in Israel
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He privately told me he thought they were
all crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd apply that to fundamentalists of
any strife.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any hashish fundamentalists out
there that insist that you smoke at a very
[SPEAKER_05]: specific way and process at a very
specific way?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing as cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thinks they have the best stuff,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, let me ask a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arguably, I think his most important
contribution is the fundamental discovery
[SPEAKER_04]: of the endocannabinoid system and its
impact in medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone talked about how this is
Nobel-worthy and he should win the Nobel
[SPEAKER_04]: Prize in medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you consider all of the medicines
that have been developed that act on the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system that have nothing
to do with phytocannabinoids, do you think
[SPEAKER_04]: that there was politics and the negative
stigma of the plant that held up that
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobel Prize, which almost seemed obvious
and at some point, just seemed laughable
[SPEAKER_04]: that he wasn't going to get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I heartily agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a subject of discussion amongst
many of us in the cannabinoid scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't discuss it with Rafi per se,
but I discussed it with one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists resident in Sweden and he was
going to look into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nomination process is a very Byzantine
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something where I or you or
anybody else can just suggest to the
[SPEAKER_02]: committee that this person is deserving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think, but I don't have
substantiation on this, that it really had
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with prohibitionist policies in
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Rob would like to address that
further, but I just say I think it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: crying shame that he didn't receive this
and he can't now because they're never
[SPEAKER_02]: awarded posthumously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone was not nominated and died in the
interim and they gave it to his family,
[SPEAKER_02]: but once you're dead, you don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, do you want to say something more
about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any insight?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have recent insights on Sweden,
but there is very little, if any,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis research going on in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although Sweden does handsomely grant
people to do all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very good system in that
regard, but especially on that background,
[SPEAKER_01]: a real paucity of science evidence and it
extends over to the industrial hemp side
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still projects trying to get
things together in Sweden, but it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: echo of projects that were tried to be
accomplished 20 years ago and longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really any new fire there and
the government is well able to help these
[SPEAKER_01]: things should they wish to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scientist that I had talked to years
ago about the Nobel nomination for Rafi,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's no longer active in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I haven't seen him at meetings in
quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think you're quite right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had students at the time that were
doing good work, but as usual,
[SPEAKER_02]: they probably found jobs in other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a problem throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you the number of excellent
cannabinoid chemists and scientists of
[SPEAKER_02]: other disciplines who had to find jobs in
other fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, that's changing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, we need a lot of analytical
chemists to deal with the output from US,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people have this
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, when you were graduating from Indiana
University, you had the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mentor, excuse me, I forgot your
professor's name there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malberg, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, what are you ever going to do
with this knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get a job with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't a guy who just liked to study
things like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to be practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul Gordon-Malberg did pass away not too
long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just a real straight sort of
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: His one claim to fame that I always really
got a kick out of because it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: different from the rest of his personality
was that he got a hold of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: limited number of moon rock samples that
came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the department, he was known as
Moon Rocks Malberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his real claim to fame in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dr. Malberg also had Carl Hellig
under him and kicked off the
[SPEAKER_00]: classification change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work came out of his lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other good stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good gland morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really nice to me in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was nice to me as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: All federally funded, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He had federal funding for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had federal funding for a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they didn't have enough funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have enough money for Carl's
work, so we gave them a grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That enabled Carl to do his work for
several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The UN grants were more involved with
trying to have some forensic angle to
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever was being done, like being able
to identify glands and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had to be some little twist that
might be able to be used to the
[SPEAKER_01]: government's advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did really good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: His grad students did as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were saying that in Sweden,
there's hardly any funding for this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, I forget his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who wrote the anti-cannabis books
from Sweden, remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at the ICRS for years, and then he
just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sure they had those disparate
elements as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Professor Malberg have an appreciation
for the impact of his work?
[SPEAKER_04]: I must have read about, I'm not kidding,
about 20 of his papers on the accumulation
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabinoids in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is extremely important seminal work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he know the impact that he had on
generations of scientists who were going
[SPEAKER_04]: to read his papers and want to continue?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know later in life if he finally
got it, but at the time, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He must have gotten it later in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't just fishing in Minnesota all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: He fully retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he left academia, he really left
academia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him at North American Industrial
Hemp meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twice, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one time I ran into him,
and it was really good to see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was trying to get involved after
retirement with the hemp side of things as
[SPEAKER_01]: an expert, basically, an expert name.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I met him the one time was
one of the hemp meetings in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was extremely nice to me and
complimentary of the work that I'd done,
[SPEAKER_02]: which shocked me that he'd seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that he was that curious still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really thought that he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really wanted me to study latissimus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another gland that secretes
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happened to study him as an
undergraduate a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was misdirected then also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another gland that secretes things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Latissimus are found in pine trees to
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main ones in tents, their name are in
rubber trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce latex, which comes from
latissimus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But latissimus make all kinds of pine oils
and even terpenes, I would assume,
[SPEAKER_01]: although I'm not sure about that,
but I bet they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all through pine trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Euphorbs is what I studied them in
undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons Dr. Malberg was
connected with so many famous historical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis papers is that he had a license,
which meant that students could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis on campus and work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas there wasn't a lot of choices
about that in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding was when he retired,
that passed and just the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi was the only one left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time I was there, there were five
licenses, as I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think John McPartland even had one of
them right at that time, and El Soli,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, and Malberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of other ones that
weren't part of a research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USDA and Bethesda, they had a license,
that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's one more, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they were really limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only a couple of them were in any kind
of an academic setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, University of Michigan and Ann
Arbor and Bloomington, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: were the only two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Harvard ever had a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just those two, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to bring it back to Rafi's work,
he got into synthetic cannabinoids at one
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can any of you speak to that work and what
you guys kind of felt like about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some people feel that it's
dangerous, but what are the advantages of
[SPEAKER_05]: doing dangerous work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he was a chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things chemists do is take
the natural molecule and try to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either longer lasting or more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of those was HU210.
[SPEAKER_02]: HU designation meant Hebrew University,
where it was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So HU210 is a synthetic analog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dimethylheptal derivative of THC,
which made it far more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was used in the lab as
something you tried to knock off the
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor and testing other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody who took this once and had
a really bad weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say who it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, that's why I didn't say his
last name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was never designed to be a
therapeutic agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has appeared in some of the synthetic
cannabinoid mixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was developed as a lab aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three dimensional mirror image was
HU211, which was non psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was actually, there were attempts to
develop this as a drug called dexanabinol
[SPEAKER_02]: by a company called Firmose in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, after they got the license,
they never checked with Rafi again,
[SPEAKER_02]: according to his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that they gave this was
someone would have a head injury and then
[SPEAKER_02]: we'd give the dexanabinol intravenously,
but only one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this worked in initial studies,
but in the pivotal phase three randomized
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled trials, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to wonder in retrospect whether
they had used it more judiciously that it
[SPEAKER_02]: could have worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Rafi was also involved in study
of the CB2 non psychoactive receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That affect pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had another synthetic agent called
HU308 that was tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then more recently, you know,
finally after all these years,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was excitement about the acid
cannabinoids, but hindered somewhat by the
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of shelf stability with those
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he made methyl esters of these and one
called HU308.
[SPEAKER_02]: HU580 is a methyl ester of cannabidiolic
acid, CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be very interesting in
treating nausea and possibly anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pro drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it's administered, it'll break
back down into CBDA in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rafi had his feet in both camps in
terms of the synthetic cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also the phyto cannabinoids,
many of which he discovered or was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first to nail down to put a fine point on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that just gives an idea of the
breadth of his work and the length of his
[SPEAKER_02]: relevance in scientific discovery over the
course of six decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how often can you say that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people make an initial
discovery and then they're sitting back or
[SPEAKER_03]: gone fishing, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you, Dr. Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak to the sort of, you know,
the reaction when people hear about
[SPEAKER_05]: synthetic cannabinoids in the cannabis
community, it's generally like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh my God, that stuff is horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the spice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like there's videos on YouTube,
but like speak to the sort of potential
[SPEAKER_05]: reasons that chemists do it and why we're,
you know, that it's not nefarious,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's not like they're trying to harm
people, but there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a good behind it where you're
trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a couple factors that
influence it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of it unfortunately is the almighty
dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, financial return on drug
development, it takes a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: To bring a medicine through FDA sanctioned
clinical trials, hundreds of millions of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for a pharmaceutical company,
it's gotta be, the view's gotta be worth
[SPEAKER_04]: the climb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, the discovery of
the endocannabinoid system impacted drug
[SPEAKER_04]: discovery because people knew how
important this system was because we knew
[SPEAKER_04]: how important the phyto cannabinoids were
on how they act on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think without exception, all the
pharmaceutical companies in the early,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the late eighties and early nineties
started developing non-phyto cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: heterocyclic molecules that looked nothing
like the phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are most notably the JW
compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are indole compounds that look
nothing like the phyto cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves, but because of the scaffold of
the molecule itself, it displays the right
[SPEAKER_04]: functionality in the right way that it
does the lock and key thing inside of
[SPEAKER_04]: these cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes a whole hell of a lot better
than the natural ligands and the phyto
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the other thing is that a lot of
people a lot of those indoles and a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: those nitrogen heterocycles don't have the
thermal stability for consumption in a
[SPEAKER_04]: vaporization kind of way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the synthetic spice molecules and all
those other synthetic cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna really thermally decompose and
degrade into a myriad of different other
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds that are gonna have all kinds of
bad impact be pulling into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I think Ethan's right,
the chemist who wants to look at the phyto
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids as being the mother nature's
lead, how can we improve on the activity
[SPEAKER_04]: of these compounds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And going back to the money thing is the
companies have to be able to patent those
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines because when they're spending
all that money on all those clinical
[SPEAKER_04]: trials, it's kind of the one conversation
I'd love to have with Ethan, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_04]: have Ethan with Rafi was what was his
opinion on running clinical trials on
[SPEAKER_04]: something like CBD, which is a public
composition to which GW does not have
[SPEAKER_04]: composition of matter patents on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's usually the top of the pyramid
in the pharmaceutical world.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a patent on the actual compound
that they've made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually if it's a starts out as a
phytonabinoid by the time synthetic
[SPEAKER_04]: chemists are done manipulating functional
groups and putting different rings and
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at different structures,
they've made it completely new compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're developing not only the
process chemistry to make that compound
[SPEAKER_04]: economically viable, but that's the
compound that ultimately they select and
[SPEAKER_04]: bring through clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do that with a public composition
like CBD, I think it was maybe the notion
[SPEAKER_04]: that the FDA approval of Epidiolex was
gonna somehow give GW the ability to have
[SPEAKER_04]: the FDA and the DEA sit down on the rest
of the CBD industry saying, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the active ingredient of our FDA
approved drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't put it in your tincture or your
dummy or your vape pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's the FDNC Act, which precludes
the use of FDA active ingredients in food,
[SPEAKER_04]: feed, or cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the CBD industry now treads lightly on
that entire regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, it sounds like you want to say
something, so go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a lot we could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could spend the rest of the
time talking about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know how patents work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, they're very broad claims and
then they're whittled down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, I think what GW was left with
was a use patent for these severe epilepsy
[SPEAKER_02]: syndromes, Dravet, Lennox-Gastaut,
and tuberous sclerosis treatment there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much money they're making
now taken over by jazz, but certainly it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not an exclusive kind of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there is this question now about
the viability of the rest of the CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's extremely extensive and it
would be hard to imagine that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be able to squelch that whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, the FDA sort of abdicated
responsibility for it at all and kicked it
[SPEAKER_02]: to Congress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that there's anyone there that's
qualified to make these kind of judgments
[SPEAKER_02]: about complex scientific and medical
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a pretty sad state of affairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's supposedly a quick fix to this,
Ethan, from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So similar to caffeine, they could make an
exception to the FD&C Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just one signature from the
Secretary of Health and Human Services
[SPEAKER_04]: just has to write a memo, sign it,
and that makes an exception.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's how caffeine could be
in Coca-Cola but it could also be active
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredient in other medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW did have the world's first high
CBD-only variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gave them a 10-year lead in front of
any other cannabis companies because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody else had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a big help for them
to be able to grow basically almost pure
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD because there's always a little bit of
THC in any CBD variety because the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase makes THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, two of you were talking about,
well, listen, I am a natural plant guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also had a patent for analogs of
anandamide because we were trying out
[SPEAKER_00]: anandamide for controlling glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out it actually did work
better than any of the classical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from anandamide, we made analogs
and we found ones that even worked better
[SPEAKER_00]: because the problem with most of the
medications are, first, it doesn't keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the eye pressure constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it up and down and up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these analogs that we
synthesized, we were able to make it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was a glaucoma medicine which
truly did have constant lowering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: eye and keeping it constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did those guys know that they needed
to, like, did you guys sell them,
[SPEAKER_05]: did Horta Farm sell them on you need a
high CBD cultivar and we can produce it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or did they come searching for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first met them, I don't know what
they were thinking in the back of their
[SPEAKER_00]: brains, but both Rob and I told the folks
at GW, Jeffrey Guy and Brian Whittle,
[SPEAKER_00]: who Brian Whittle is dead now,
but Jeffrey Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we told them that if you take CBD in
equal amounts to THC, it will relieve a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the problems that naive users have
with, you know, getting too high and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting scared and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ran with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either it was mine and Rob's information
or information they gleaned other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so when they came to us,
they wanted CBD and they wanted THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had talks with them too,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeffrey Guy started as a plant guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of his initial work, he actually had
a patent on traditional Chinese medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: mixture to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, actually the first plant patent
in the UK and maybe Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so no, he was a real proponent,
at least in the early days of the
[SPEAKER_03]: entourage concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it was ironic that Epidiolex wound up
being a 98% pure CBD preparation,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ethan, doesn't that play to kind of
like the heart of the issue here,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is that if the cannabis plant
teaches us many things, but if it teaches
[SPEAKER_04]: us anything, it teaches us again,
this entourage or ensemble effect,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you just can't replicate in single
ingredient, single active ingredient
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been preaching this gospel for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do we go from here, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep showing how it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are plenty of detractors
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy who has taken delight in
publishing stuff about that the entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effect isn't proven or, you know,
other theories aren't proven.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much proof do you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tremendous body of literature
that's taken place since 1999 when
[SPEAKER_02]: Professor Mishulam and Ben Shabbat
suggested that sometimes plants are better
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines than the single compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pointed out that that was theoretical
at that time, but 24 years later,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's no longer theoretical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proven.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have many examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point do you say, look,
we have the examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the claim that it doesn't matter is,
you know, it's a done deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been proven that you have
synergy of ingredients in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it becomes a matter of trying to
figure out the best combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the approach we're taking now
at Credo Science and developing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, complex mixtures of cannabinoids
and terpenoids from the plant that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be fit for a purpose,
whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it means a different thing in
different situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my spin on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anybody who's ever smoked cannabis
and if they were to smoke pure THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% pure, and then spike it with a little
bit of limaline or mersine or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else, then their doubt would disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're doing work now with Ryan
Ventre at Johns Hopkins to show the
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is through using pure THC and
pure terpenoids in the lab double blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully in the next couple of years,
we'll have papers showing further proof
[SPEAKER_02]: for these concepts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unreal that we have to prove anything
because think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're consuming something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has no flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has no taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a single methodology of consuming
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're putting these flavors that you
can taste and you can smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course they're going to add to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be like eating food that didn't
taste like anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And suddenly someone gave you food that
had wonderful tastes and smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a different experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so blown away sometimes that people
are so unwilling to understand that when
[SPEAKER_05]: you smell something, your olfactory,
that is different from seeing and
[SPEAKER_05]: touching, feeling, hearing, that smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what has probably attracted us
to foods and to one another and to just
[SPEAKER_05]: all of these smells that are out in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing that we have to prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The system, the sites of emotion,
tapping into memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Locking in memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've definitely got a few memories from
very specific smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is... Reminds me of a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in my neurology days, I saw a patient
came back into my office and there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: smell of Afghan hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything here like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saw another patient came back in,
again, the Afghan hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally put the nose to work and
echolocated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it was was a grapefruit that a
patient had given me a couple of days
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sitting on my desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked it up and it had changed over the
course of two days and smell very
[SPEAKER_02]: reminiscent of Afghani hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between the limonene and whatever cesspore
terpenoids there were in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Newt-Ketone is the grapefruit terpene,
one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, because the difference between
Newt-Ketone and valencine is just a
[SPEAKER_04]: carbonyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one oxidation turns a CH2 into a
carbonyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go from valencine oranges to
Newt-Ketone grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to share one thing with you,
Ethan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my last correspondence with Professor
Mishulam, I sent him a link to the nose
[SPEAKER_04]: paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the nose paper and I had talked
with Jeremy on Clubhouse before it had
[SPEAKER_04]: come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he had either sent me an early
draft of it, but I read it and I was just
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh man, this is such a cool paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yes, this is it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In all of this news of lab shopping and
THC inflation, this is what I've needed to
[SPEAKER_04]: read this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sent the link to Rafi and he got back
a couple of days later and he loved the
[SPEAKER_04]: paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't have the occasion to talk to him
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll see if I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was either a LinkedIn message
that he sent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, this is terrific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could forward that, I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will really look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe valencine is a terpene found in
cannabis, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sesquiterpene, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, some of these very trace amounts
of sesquiterpenoids make a tremendous
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as everyone will attest, it doesn't
take a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few molecules would be something that
you can sense with your olfactory
[SPEAKER_02]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And goodness knows what they're doing
pharmacologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been looking at recently is pure
THC-A and I'm dosing it with phials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, phials are maybe a
hundred or a thousand times more volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: and stinkier than any terpene I've ever
worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious to see if the thials
modulate or potentiate THC or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they psychoactive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they contribute?
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it the preenyl sulfide that you
have, preenylated sulfides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the one that the folks that
gave it to me, I think from, I'm afraid I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't remember the name of the lab,
but it's the people who published the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious and that's what I got
this pure THC-A for, to mix with the
[SPEAKER_00]: phials.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's when you got to invite Nick
Ziegler on because that guy did 20 plus
[SPEAKER_05]: years of thial work with Yakima Chief
Hopps and he discovered over 1400 phials
[SPEAKER_05]: present in hops, which is unbelievable
when you really think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many could there be?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're in such small amounts,
do we have to think of these profiles?
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally, I try not to say terpenes
all the time anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to say volatile organic compounds
because when I say terpenes, I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm leaving out the esters and the thials
and the thialates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, in the area that really needs
investigation, what are the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of the esters?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because clearly they're really
contributing to the fruity aromas that
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to be really preferred by a lot of
cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that garlic smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know very well, Ethan, that before the
terpenes work that Rob and I and other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks were doing with me, nobody really
truly believed that the terpenes were
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating THC or potentiating THC,
but we proved it pretty conclusively 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You proved it in your apartment to random
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was like, I didn't need to read
any papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because we didn't publish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for in-house work, really,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I loved your passion because I can
still picture myself back in your
[SPEAKER_05]: apartment in early 2000.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just remember how excited you were
sitting on the edge of the couch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now try it with the mercine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just so stoked and pumped on the edge
of a new discovery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I told Robby about the terpene work,
he was really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him an explanation of
everything, how it all worked and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Related to that, people may be interested
to know that the teeming THC paper
[SPEAKER_02]: resulted from his 80th birthday because
there was a symposium held in Israel in
[SPEAKER_02]: honor of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gave me the opportunity to publish
that in a high profile journal,
[SPEAKER_02]: British Journal of Pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the right opportunity to
present that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it all came from the concept of
the entourage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to give credit there in support
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the stats on that paper,
Ethan?
[SPEAKER_04]: I must imagine it's cited thousands of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been cited quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for four years, it was the most
commonly accessed scientific paper on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where it stacks up now,
but it was on top for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first place that I released the
information about the terpenes being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to modify and potentiate THC was at the
ICRS meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember which one it was,
but people there... Hungry.
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hungry, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I was with you prior to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sam, you were talking before about a
movie that was made with Professor
[SPEAKER_04]: Mishulam in your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that movie exist on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or can we see that movie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a VHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several VHS copies of it,
but I haven't digitalized it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen that, Ethan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have shown it to me when
I... It was called Northern Light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was about Dr. Mishulam,
the cannabis... I don't think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: subtitled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have vague memories of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of movies, people might want to
look for The Scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's an hour movie that Zach
Klein did, mainly from interviews done in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012, but a great testament to Professor
Mishulam, his early history, all the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hilarious with the little cartoon
sketches where he says, well, I went and I
[SPEAKER_04]: had coffee with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So wherever he went, he had coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he went and smuggled five pounds of
hash from the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he had coffee with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So wherever he went, he had coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: But such an unassuming, humble man,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's a lesson for all
of us in... Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was a scientist and he did have a
competitive streak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell a story in relation to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he and his colleagues had discovered
all these endocannabinoid analogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were seemingly active,
some were inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I must have asked him several times,
what about docosahexaenoic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: derivative?
[SPEAKER_02]: So DHA, docosahexaenoic acid is a
component of the cell membranes in our
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also what's in fish oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's the reason that people take
fish oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I asked, he was evasive and
sort of waved me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't understand it because he was
usually so veiling of his knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at some meeting and we're on a bus
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he whispers to me, you were asking
about docosahexaenoic acid derivatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, we have discovered that there
were about 1200 times more powerful than
[SPEAKER_02]: the phytocannabinoids in osteoblastic
function, building up osteoporotic bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is work that he was doing with the
late Etai Bob also in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he apparently had been working on this
and didn't want to say anything about it
[SPEAKER_02]: until he knew what the real answer was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to my knowledge, nobody's carried that
work forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people thought, geez, everything's
been done, that's never gonna be true in
[SPEAKER_02]: this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is so much to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've just scratched the surface of
what the other phytocannabinoids can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 150 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the basic pharmacology of about a
dozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the bandwidth's taken up with THC
and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas CBG is a fantastically therapeutic
compound and really hasn't gotten the
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCV, again, there's been some work,
but goodness knows what we can get out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the other 138 that really haven't
had the attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with selective breeding and some
funding for research, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: great stuff to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was one of the problems,
Ethan, in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like before we started breeding for single
cannabinoid cannabis varieties was to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands on the material was incredibly
expensive and difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we set about breeding
varieties that had one single cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: so that there would be large amounts for
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that you could use them as basic
colors like to paint a painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: How like how does one go about is in
breeding and Rob can chime in on this as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just standard knowledge that you can
there are breeding techniques to breed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, certain things to be produced
singularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that something you guys had to sort
of discover along the way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how easy is it to just start growing
a cannabis plant and only make it produce
[SPEAKER_05]: one cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's actually fairly difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most people, including plant
breeders, cannabis researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe I wouldn't be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were actually incredibly
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd start with a variety that,
say, had tiny amounts of THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we were using a South African
variety, a Afghan variety, a Thai variety
[SPEAKER_00]: and California orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that those varieties all had,
you know, one percent or less of THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we inbred each of those individually,
self did two, three, four generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and each time would take the seeds that we
produced and find the highest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: target and kept doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, after you inbreed
cannabis three, four times, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is the most inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it quits dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just has no resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis is a heterozygote plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you breed it to be basically
closer to homozygote, it loses all of its
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to diseases and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found out was that we took
those four populations that we had done
[SPEAKER_00]: that to and combined them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hybrid vigor was restored.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the different sides of all of it,
you know, from the from the chemistry that
[SPEAKER_05]: Mishulam practiced to the to the
collecting of the seeds and hash producing
[SPEAKER_05]: countries to the actual breeding work,
you know, and then earlier we were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about how it's all about, you know,
the profile, the entourage, all of these
[SPEAKER_05]: different sort of profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just talking to everybody that it's
this it's this whole that you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, you know, I was going to kind of
ask Rob about this earlier as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the sense that cannabis produces many
different holes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can say we want the whole profile,
but we're certainly not using the
[SPEAKER_05]: cellulose and the fiber and the seed,
the rich amino acid seed for that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid inhalation, medical dash
recreational experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can take the resin and think that
you have the whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, cannabis always seems to be
about the one from the whole, at least
[SPEAKER_05]: from my experience, that when I'm making
if I want to make seed oil or de-hulled
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds, that comes from the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the cellulose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the medicinal component.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just an interesting sort of
concept that you can take the one from the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole if you're making clothing,
you know, which Rob has a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: experience with textiles and the history
of cannabis and hemp textiles and the
[SPEAKER_05]: difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do we see that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm sure you've seen breeding for
textiles even just naturally happening,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether they knew what they were doing or
not, versus the same concept that we do
[SPEAKER_05]: for the medicines, which are chemists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now trying to figure out ways to produce
embryos and seeds that produce better
[SPEAKER_05]: fibers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of just going on, but chime in any
time, Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do people mean by whole?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll be cynical for a minute,
but whole plant extracts are extracts that
[SPEAKER_01]: include more than one class of compounds,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you've got some terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole flower extract, whole whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm being cynical, but it's overused.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also can mean natural in some ways that
people use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean either of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, what it means is it's got to have
every cannabinoid in every terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't, it's not whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, well, that would be the ultimate
definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, no product, no extract,
no even lab ever can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get lost, especially volatile
organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go bye-bye real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you have to do is sort of think about
it and they disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's an overused thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's back to kind of like the
arguments years ago, but again,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural versus organic, until the USDA
just co-opted the word organic and decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to rule it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they don't necessarily in a
world of branding and marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to mean things considerably
different than their actual definitions,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just replying to some of the people in the
chat room here.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are enjoying the conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing panel, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always appreciate a good panel on a Sunday
morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to check out of my hotel in about a
half an hour here and drive home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a nice couple of days up in Whistler,
riding with the family and enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have heaps of snow there now?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got so much in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you guys got it all, most of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have snow, but nothing like Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got like 50 feet or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the biggest snowfall in 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a week later, before any of it's
melted at all, except on the roads maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: it snows another four feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's snowed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the water reservoirs in California
needed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's flooding like hell everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just beginning to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so all those huge glass houses in
the middle of the state growing mids,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outer Imelde is going to be rampant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just busing on hell weather
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good winter for growing
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm busting on Mojave on that statement
there, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is your current life like,
Rob?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you working on right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just finished sorting through a lot of
hemp textiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came back from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the last 10 years, I've bought
quite a collection of hemp rugs and grain
[SPEAKER_01]: sacks and a few saddlebags, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practical kind of hemp products,
heavy hemp, not fine hemp things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a lot of them stored in a
warehouse in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent four days all day long going
through those things and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what to do with them largely.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them were keeping for
collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus has known about this activity for a
long time because I do it with my partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: Amir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Marcus introduced us back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a great time doing this and made
some serious decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: About what to do with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I came home and I had shipped a
lot of things back to Turkey years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought things home a few dozen kilos at
a time and got things DHL'd and filled up
[SPEAKER_01]: my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had more than two tons of hemp things
here that were Turkish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got them shipped back to Turkey about
five years ago and put in a warehouse so
[SPEAKER_01]: we could spread them out and deal with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kept some things, of course,
as collectors do, and I put them under my
[SPEAKER_01]: bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did what my lady calls the fucking
under the bed hemp and went through and
[SPEAKER_01]: organized it all, which is cool because I
managed to look at everything that built
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a lot of things after I'd sent
things back and I'd never cataloged those
[SPEAKER_01]: and still haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to look at everything again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have my head around all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the project is to write a book about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selections and photographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wrote a bunch of text already over
the years for our websites and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the pieces are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to put it all together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to give a shout out to Amir
because you mentioned him, probably maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: quite frankly, the kindest human being
I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very considerate, just very kind,
just an awesome all around dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're watching Amir, we love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Amir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he loves the smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a hashish aficionado of the highest
order.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was just talking in private with
Ethan in the chat room saying maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: another 20 minutes if you guys have
anything else you want to mention about
[SPEAKER_05]: Rafi or anything really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just got to get going here after the two
hour mark and get out of my hotel and get
[SPEAKER_07]: back homeward bound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if there is an incredible body of
work that exists and a lot of it is open
[SPEAKER_04]: share accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what his final total was,
Ethan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I must have about 400 papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's north of 600.
[SPEAKER_04]: North of 600.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a tremendous collaborator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just his lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing about the cannabinoid scientific
community is that they're good
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these papers will have 12 or more
people in different institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, Rafi does this part
and Roger Purvey does this part and Paul
[SPEAKER_02]: Parker does this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, he he was a contributor
and it wasn't just the the basic science
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should point out he was highly involved
in clinical applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first paper on cannabidiol for
epilepsy wasn't in relation to the work at
[SPEAKER_02]: GW.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was back in 1980 collaborating with the
Brazilians, Cunha, Carlini, and that
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the International Association for
Cannabinoid Medicines was formed in 2001,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was there and he was at every meeting
and helping to guide people in what was
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't a matter of making
semi-synthetic analogs that could be
[SPEAKER_02]: patented.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really was into use of the natural
cannabis extracts and how they could be
[SPEAKER_02]: harnessed therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the way it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Renaissance man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had interest in all these different
facets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also were in contact with the
Brazilians and that influenced our early
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD work because we bred a high CBD
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it wasn't as high as the one
I eventually licensed at GW, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: good enough that they were really
interested in it in in Brazil because they
[SPEAKER_00]: they really couldn't afford to get the CBD
materials that they needed for their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wouldn't have been been able to
grow it in the tropics very well either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ethan, when I asked before where do we
go from here and you started telling us
[SPEAKER_04]: about all the exciting work you're doing
at Credo, how does how does how do
[SPEAKER_04]: government and regulatory bodies catch up
with where we're already at, which is they
[SPEAKER_04]: need a different way of regulating this
mechanism?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that was that the situation that they
recently made is that cannabinoids don't
[SPEAKER_04]: fit in this mono single ingredient
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to create a different process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know how it's going to
shake out irrespective of what they or
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are always going to be three
echelons of activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbal cannabis and it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forms on the supplement industry,
hopefully with some measure of quality
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, the pharmaceutical
approaches, hopefully with phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're trying to focus on all
three more selective breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: development of rational supplements and
also pharmaceutical approaches,
[SPEAKER_02]: because anybody who thinks it stops with
Sativex and Epidiolytes has got another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are fewer companies that are working
on it, but we're involved with two at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point, Endura Pharmaceuticals out of
Vancouver, BC and Canerda out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Greater Toronto area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just cannabinoids and
terpenoids, the can flavons are of
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendous interest medicinally and
portend to provide really great things.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the areas of treating inflammation,
cancer, and maybe even neurodegenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, easy for me to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: That can coexist in framework where
prohibition is ending and adult use,
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational is coming online.
[SPEAKER_04]: These kinds of things can coexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they aren't mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plenty of people approaching
this in their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's a big tent in that respect
and we don't get in each other's way too
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But flavonoids is what we were interested
in next after the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that the terpenes could modulate
and potentiate the cannabinoids and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were interested in the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dr. Mishulin told me that if
flavonoids are combusted or vaporized,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're deactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're effective orally, but they're
not effective smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I dropped the flavonoids after that
because I was really looking for patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that were smoking because that at the time
was the delivery form.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, more to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're potent antioxidants and
maybe they have something to do with the
[SPEAKER_04]: overall stability of whole plant
preparations, right, Ethan, where maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not doing something medicinally,
but they're doing something chemically on
[SPEAKER_04]: the mixture itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people think that's not likely,
we can give the example of St. John's wort
[SPEAKER_02]: hypericum perforatum.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the so-called active ingredients as
a treatment for depression is a thing
[SPEAKER_02]: called hyperforin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only two-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like this in this plane,
but on its end, it's like the rings of
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not see them if it's at a
certain angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, hyperforin, when it is isolated,
is extremely volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be stored under liquid nitrogen,
but in an extract of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good reason that we've had
galenicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tinctures have been popular in medicine
for at least a thousand years,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the reason is it's a good extraction
and preservation system, so they ain't
[SPEAKER_03]: going away either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Dr. Mishulam for the
gathering place of the ICRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is where all of the modern
cannabis science has been announced first,
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of the people doing the work were
also members, but incredible world,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ICRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the first meeting I went to was
1993 in Toronto, and the meeting this year
[SPEAKER_00]: is again in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what goes around comes around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, it's in the summertime when
it's nice in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't like minus 40?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I live on Lake Champlain, so I get my
taste of winter every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you guys see Rafi's work going in
the next 25 to 50 years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to pick up the torch,
and where is cannabis chemistry heading?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like throwing a stone into a
lake, and the ripples just spread out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentric circle in all these different
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as I could see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, his legacy is going to be remembered
forever as far as this field goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no worry there, and there are
plenty of eager young scientists
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: My worry is, can they find jobs after
graduate school?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a constant problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the great scientists I met at my
first ICRS meeting in 1999 graduated,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had to go to work for a tobacco
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great loss to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the good thing about that,
of course, is most of the big tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: companies now are diversifying into
cannabis, so maybe what comes around goes
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but maybe not too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's an old
saying, he's not really gone if you
[SPEAKER_04]: remember him, and you keep him in your
heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about that when I think about my
most favorite musician, Mr. Jerry Garcia,
[SPEAKER_04]: who passed away a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to Jerry's music every day,
and I appreciate Rafi for his body of
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I treasure the correspondence I had with
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan, I'm now collaborating with Alan
Howlett.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at some of these minor
isomers that are formed in this Delta-8
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing process where they're
converting CBD into THC, and these
[SPEAKER_04]: iso-isomers are found along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collaborating with Professor Howlett to
understand, do they behave like
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the effects of these byproducts?
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, Ethan, there's just this
whole landscape of opportunity,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we all stand on the shoulders of Roger
Adams and of Robert Sidney Kahn and Wood
[SPEAKER_04]: Spivvy and Easterfield, those first three
guys who are the first people who made the
[SPEAKER_04]: distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someday, Marcus, they're going to be
talking about standing on your shoulders
[SPEAKER_04]: and going back and watching episodes of
Hash Church and listening to us three talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about Hash and laugh and look at the time
that we witnessed here, which is the
[SPEAKER_04]: ending of cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just an incredible opportunity for
gifted people to get into this industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and apply knowledge and creativity,
and it's all going to be thanks to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Professor Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just kind of like whether or not
cannabis use is all medical or not,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether you like it or not it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whether you like it or not,
if you're in cannabis today, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: thanking Professor Mishulam for all of
this work and all of his contributions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus, thank you for having us here,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be changing the name once it's
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go into YouTube and this will be
the first Hash Temple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super good bunch of people
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming out, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you, Rob, Dr. Ethan,
Dr. Mark, Stinkman, Sam and all the people
[SPEAKER_05]: watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do it again one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye bye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
