[SPEAKER_00]: I want to apologize to both you and Jody.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I volunteered for a long time around
here and did a few things and bugged them
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to give me a job, well not exactly
before I started working, I finally got a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do with Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a situation that came up here in
the city where they were trying to even
[SPEAKER_00]: ban herbs and spices and put all sorts of
regulations on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was elected to go with Mark,
set up a table in front of the library on
[SPEAKER_00]: Denman Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pumped to save
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the table, we go up there,
we got all the flyers and we get the table
[SPEAKER_00]: set up and we're out there for about a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The library people come down and go,
no you're not staying here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark goes, yeah we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay, let's do whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good and then two long layers
of police came by.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, you got to move off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark said, no I don't have to move off
here, this is public
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bag of weed in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to step up here to show my medal in
front of my beer
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you want to go to jail too?
[SPEAKER_00]: And before he could say that, thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark says, no, no, no, you don't want to
go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look out for the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times since then,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember being Mark's first time,
I guess, with the late, great Ian Hunter
[SPEAKER_02]: was put down somewhere and I had just been
attending office in Africa for 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good weed down there,
a lot of good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some other people out east
there, but we were mostly doing our own
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, okay great, Ian had a lot
of flaky ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, well he's going to open a
store, good luck to him, hope that works
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came back 10 weeks later,
and there was this beautiful tiny little
[SPEAKER_02]: store on Hastings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing to think how small it was,
what a tiny little place that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how huge, multi-level floors,
locations, all the things that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started working there for a while,
regular saffron holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came in to work behind the counter,
a job which I was not pretty good at at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not made it to that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think me and another fellow,
Mark Bologna, were hired to temporarily
[SPEAKER_02]: mark me out there, sleep in the front lot
and work in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like sleeping on the front desk
there, trying to stay awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't get to stay out on that job.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the best, I think, Mark made a wise
decision on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I was good at was writing and
editing, and Mark was working on the
[SPEAKER_02]: newsletter, the marijuana newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started off pretty small, and Mark,
when he came, had millions of projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: and managed to offend pretty much
everybody in the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already here and told us,
oh we were all avatars and not break it at
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so much better, and he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting seeing all these
people, how aggravated they were by Mark,
[SPEAKER_02]: and pretty much all of them ended up
working for him eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started working on that newsletter,
and soon we had turned it into Canada's
[SPEAKER_02]: Culture magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I spent the next 10 years,
was working on that with Mark as
[SPEAKER_02]: publisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through so many raids,
and so many challenges, and so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things, and one of the things I learned
from Mark mostly is not to give up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to keep on pushing, and to find new
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bounce back from so many
challenges and so many things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you just keep on going,
and don't stop, find a new angle,
[SPEAKER_02]: find a new way, and just be persistent,
and you'll be amazed that you can get away
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've certainly taken that to heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the biggest raid that we went
[SPEAKER_02]: through, tied up in a lot of that stuff,
and that daughter being born that night,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that raid was happening, was the
[SPEAKER_02]: prettiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although a lot of things changed that
night, it also pushed us to new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always, seeing Mark pushing into deeds
was often at a time of desperation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to do something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to find a way to make more
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that deed catalog in the magazine,
or we're going to start sending deeds to
[SPEAKER_02]: the US, or whatever the decision was at
that time, to make that money,
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep things going, pushing things
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't ever know where it's going to
end up, where it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Mark imagined that 10 years
later, 15 years later, he'd be sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: here in this room with all these people
doing these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew it was going to be a long and
strange adventure, but you never really
[SPEAKER_02]: know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something I've seen about Mark is he
always really lives in the present,
[SPEAKER_02]: just tries to focus on the present moment
in a very kind of Zen master sort of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really mourning too much about
anything beyond the next week or the next
[SPEAKER_02]: few hours, really, in terms of getting
that money today, or just deal with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll find those solutions tomorrow,
on the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting it dead and having these
challenges being really highly motivating
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of, we've got to find that money
somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get to work and get it early
and make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it's been working towards the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we find we've been given
something, or we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been banned, if our culture would be the
same as it was, and if somehow this
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibitionary period wasn't necessary for
us to really understand how useful this
[SPEAKER_02]: plan could be for us, and that by banning
it, they made us somehow stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that AP convention that I was
at, when they banned me from being there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they made me a hundred times stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the fact that I go to an AP
convention, it's new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cared before, but now that they
banned me, now it's a big deal that I got
[SPEAKER_02]: in without having to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, when they come and they raid
Mark, and they put these
[SPEAKER_02]: terms for Mark, but it's also,
it's part of the process of making these
[SPEAKER_02]: changes, and that by these things
happening, it's only going to make Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: more powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: If these things hadn't happened,
Mark's voice would not be able to reach so
[SPEAKER_02]: many people around the world, and we would
not be able to do the things that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not fun for Mark to go to
jail, for those of us who love him,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, we can cry our tears at
different places or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an important thing that's happening,
and by doing this, it's going to bring so
[SPEAKER_02]: many other people that are also hurting
out there, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: also in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's millions of them all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terrible things that this war can do
to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see what kind of things we can do
to make a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just hope that Mark, being
[SPEAKER_02]: in jail...
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
