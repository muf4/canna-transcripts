in so long and I'm thinking, you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I have a talk with Dave

[SPEAKER_03]: of problems being able to get the medicine

in and he goes and I'm really scrambling
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get proper dosages to people and

okay we have these suppositories that are
[SPEAKER_03]: working extremely well and we have someone
have this ovarian cancer and it kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: really went and it was something they
don't understand why it's working so well
[SPEAKER_03]: because once you take the Suppository,
it doesn't even show up in your system You
[SPEAKER_03]: have cannabinoids in it Wow because they
do all kinds of testing and he's like I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to gift you these suppositories that
was really nice and I had no idea what
[SPEAKER_03]: type of condition that our friend was
suffering from or where the cancer was and
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so ironic that I think This is gonna
be the key Well, I can tell you right off
[SPEAKER_04]: the bat and I was talking to my friend
earlier and sort of mentioned he was
[SPEAKER_04]: getting excited He's like do you think
this could really work and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course I do it's worked for lots of
people Why wouldn't it it started creating
[SPEAKER_04]: this hope first in him then in his cousin
then in his auntie and and in you know You
[SPEAKER_04]: could feel it before we left.
[SPEAKER_04]: We dosed her a small amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was a little bigger than a small
amount Yeah, it was it was a mill and so
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Nice to see her in the 30 to 45
minutes afterwards The change was very
[SPEAKER_04]: noticeable.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was leaning into her conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was paying more attention You could
you could see physically her pain levels
[SPEAKER_04]: were going down and she was actually You
know, she had hope and she kept mentioning
[SPEAKER_04]: it over and over again And I told my
friend, you know Hope is like a big part
[SPEAKER_04]: of putting cancer into remission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously you need the right tools But you
need the right opportunity hope hope is
[SPEAKER_04]: the beginning and we left there Johnny be
We left some hope there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh a big box of it a huge box of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah No, it felt really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank your friend for for
helping out obviously he's doing this In
[SPEAKER_04]: it's amazing to me in this day and age
that pure crop dots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah pure crop dot CA We'll put it in the
we'll put it in the bottom there where you
[SPEAKER_04]: can look at these products But it's
amazing to me that legal companies are
[SPEAKER_04]: still not allowed to make this product
Available to me John's friend is a hero
[SPEAKER_04]: for practicing the level of civil
disobedience That's necessary to get
[SPEAKER_04]: people like the woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just saw she's the hero taking the
medicine that required is required Why are
[SPEAKER_04]: we not making this accessible?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we worried about the bottom lines
of companies?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm personally very very excited to
have been a part of this today We'll
[SPEAKER_04]: follow along the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really hope that the story Continues on
with with you know, there's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: an ending to it but there'll be a
continuation and as long as that
[SPEAKER_04]: continuation is successful and the quality
of life is increased for this woman and
[SPEAKER_04]: the quantity of life is increased then
Cannabis has once again done its job and I
[SPEAKER_04]: saw do its job right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have a bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know let's do it Hey, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was that was a that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I I Love Teaching people about how
cannabis saves lives and and and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I would say I would talk to her
about The decarboxylated and how it binds
[SPEAKER_03]: the receptors and and the work that we did
with dr Paul Hornby back in the days and
[SPEAKER_03]: how I got it from my opioid drugs using
just a natural GABA and converted forms of
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and and really it's it's it's come so
far now and we're going back 15 years ago
[SPEAKER_03]: and now it's today it's like we're still
fighting for it to be Accessed I know they
[SPEAKER_03]: they just make those things so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen anything like it
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty crazy the pressure I had to
use let me tell you Anyway, very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to you know,
and in during this she was like we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: make these things available to people like
it's all it's so contagious the the vibe
[SPEAKER_04]: of wanting to help people I can already
picture this woman getting better creating
[SPEAKER_04]: her own little group and it starts like
everybody does for information getting
[SPEAKER_04]: this information information out there
like all of you who do the same thing and
[SPEAKER_03]: only people who do that they're always
sharing and talking and We talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: making it normal by just sitting here out
in the open doing dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're allowed to did you bring a dabber?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Hope you should have a toka poker in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh a toka poca.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello pigeon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta have one We got nothing I have
to go We got not what you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing I forgot was that you
know, we got your keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make this work We can do dunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing dunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing dunks sometimes You have to
make the best of it, dude exactly the
[SPEAKER_04]: worst-case scenario when you don't have a
dabber is you need to take a dab That's
[SPEAKER_04]: about ten times the size of the one you
maybe it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Johnny B's dab right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that Okay, you know what I have to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing happened last time on this is
As you can see didn't get cleaned that
[SPEAKER_00]: well, so we got some DC cleaner Gonna fire
it up Nice little business card I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think I have even a business card in my
entire wallet No, I like to fold them and
[SPEAKER_04]: then use it to drop the resonant but so
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do a dump another way I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know if I sat here and try to burn
all this off I'd actually chow's my banger
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're gonna bear with me guys here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing the quick clean to And but you
know, the best thing about this lady was
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, let me do it for you She was
going on or how she had a kidney removed
[SPEAKER_03]: and how she went through three months of
full-blown A chemotherapy and and this her
[SPEAKER_03]: pain was getting so bad and just know what
do they have on?
[SPEAKER_03]: hydromorphine it's like all this bad stuff
and And she's telling me about all the
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical drugs she was on and then I
date back and like we know Go right back
[SPEAKER_03]: to you Mike, you know and talk about our
good good neighbor Mike Martin and that
[SPEAKER_03]: says what Mike was Michael's also on a
Like a cocktail of drugs and and when I
[SPEAKER_03]: see me have to get rid of these goes But
that's what keeps me alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's killing you actually It's
like it's like certain things are killing
[SPEAKER_03]: you the opioid drugs are killing you those
heavy heavy Narcotic drugs are only
[SPEAKER_03]: causing more pain and even talking with
the lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to her about chasing page She
looked me in her eyes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, you know what I'm talking about
Oh, yes And the only person who knows
[SPEAKER_03]: about chasing pain are the people who's
truly in pain because you can't explain
[SPEAKER_03]: that to anyone who have done it and then
then she looked at me she goes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I'm talking about and I go I
Deal with pain and I know how I deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: it and I use cannabis to take the edge off
She was well, I want to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pants and you can't get rid of pain Pain
is what we call manageable But when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using opiates you get rid of it and that's
why you're chasing pain because pain never
[SPEAKER_03]: goes away when you're dealing with
something that's chronic and something
[SPEAKER_03]: it's called being able to manage your pain
and That's what cannabis does for me every
[SPEAKER_03]: day and you guys see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing, dude You've Chas the fuck
out of this bowl John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I said it was it was just
dirty So what had happened is I needed to
[SPEAKER_03]: do a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: No DC cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: No nothing So it got a little dirty,
but I see I didn't I didn't chas it
[SPEAKER_04]: because it isn't pretty good It's there's
some chas, but it's in the weirdest place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at the top of the bowl, but it's it's
good We're gonna get it all off and then
[SPEAKER_03]: worry about your chance is even opening Up
the container of hashbrown.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the turpings and and their eyes
lighting up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's looking at me I'm like, that's what
took my pain away when you showed up in
[SPEAKER_03]: the hospital.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true when I took out my I can't
believe that was three years ago three
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago and I went like that I go that's
what helped me in Her eyes lit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really her daughter looked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes I can see that I'm no This is
what's so important when it comes to pain
[SPEAKER_03]: management and fighting disease and
conditions Is the turps the turps the
[SPEAKER_03]: turps do the turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it only 23 degrees Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit no, it's more like 80
[SPEAKER_03]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't actually have a That's gay we got
that glass bowl right here you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a carb cap Okay, well here you go
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can move it around a little bit
how about that for the low temp for the
[SPEAKER_00]: win There you go we can hit you up a
little bit more I
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't understand why it's reading the
temperature So incorrectly it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: reading It at 24 degrees Celsius 92.9
Fahrenheit 91 degrees Fahrenheit I Clean
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how I was just talking about pain
control and how the flavors up and the
[SPEAKER_03]: flavonoids and then did you read that post
that I just recently found out that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have find out the flavonoids in cannabis
certain flavonoids a and B or Napros not
[SPEAKER_03]: known about that for some years now even I
think I think the best part of boat is is
[SPEAKER_03]: that they've now put it on paper It's 800
times more stronger than aspirin like a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole new fucking painkiller coming out on
the market all natural I know we get very
[SPEAKER_03]: little from cannabis, but I guarantee you
with the massive amounts of cannabis We're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have fucking shit into this shit to
help fucking people out man Fuck aspirin
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck Tylenol get rid of that farmer shit
because look out natural cannabis is ready
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to take a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which one do you want?
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez, I haven't even broken off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just pull some of this out or
something We're at 830 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna love this I open up one of these
containers the other day and it had a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of um Turps on it and I got on my
fingers and my buddy goes here.

here Oh my god, I smelt turps all fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: day.

[SPEAKER_03]: There's a culprit there One of you can
smell the dump me in my nose Don't be
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what we call dunking.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how you dab your front.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a dunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dab It's drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got to get it in there and and oh
Yeah, you can even smell it I can smell
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash and that was talk about when I
open up my can I can taste it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you taste the hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you taste that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I can taste the rosin So it was
really nice is opening up and talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the terpenes and when I actually
just gave her a little smell and her eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: lighting up and just the whole room and
then all of a sudden like I can smell it
[SPEAKER_03]: over here and it's kind of like a Big
party started happening in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was liking the turps.

time and I'm glad to have been able to
[SPEAKER_04]: share a bowl with you here and We might
have to go somewhere sit down and like do
