[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome everybody to Bubble Man's
World and welcome to Hash Church episode
[SPEAKER_09]: 153, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're three episodes away from three years
of Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's pretty, pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna send the link out here real
quick to our friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see, one and two and finally,
but not least, last but not least,
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll hit there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That way we can get Etienne in the room
who let's be honest, he's always first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank God for Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, 141 people have beat him into the
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, 160 people have beat him into the
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys all had a wonderful
weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was doing wake and bakes the whole week
long, but we are at Sunday and I've
[SPEAKER_09]: invited a pretty good crew in today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hope that we get some friends in
here sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll just start it out with a rip
like right away, shall we?
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone ready?
[SPEAKER_09]: Got your rigs?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Sam's got his.
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready, Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't hear anyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they can hear me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they can hear me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I cannot hear you, Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you, Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you tried talking yet?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sammy, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on mute, so try to unclick yourself
if you... Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can be heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Etienne cannot be heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Etienne is having the same problem as last
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was throwing me off because no one was
making sounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Etienne will be back in a few
minutes and good after, what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening for you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what we say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, regardless of what we say,
I'm having a bong rep.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll puff to myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need anyone else to talk to me in
the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do this Hash Church 153.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's puff it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sam slides in first ahead of
Etienne.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't see that very often.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I'm a pretty slippery guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you want to be, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you want to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how are things going on over in
Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful day today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I heard you saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's always sweet when it's a beautiful
day in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, because we get a lot of our sunshine
in the form of condensed rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you guys are kind of on par with
Vancouver in a sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also get a good amount of rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: We call it liquid sunshine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back Etienne and welcome Mark
Chaldone, Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, bud?
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your kind of vacation?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my dad was in town last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were out to brunch and never really
made it back in time to get back on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before then we were, yeah,
checked out for like three weekends for
[SPEAKER_07]: the baker's dozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're about to rip it up in Dix in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll always be fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fish loves Dix, but it'll always be a good
show out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hi to all the people going up to those
shows in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting it with a bong rip got me like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, is Etienne trying to talk again?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's still not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's your earphones or something
that's cut me out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really dislike technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not not Etienne having them, but like
myself, when I'm having them, like I feel
[SPEAKER_09]: for Etienne, when you just want to be
heard and you cannot be heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure he'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: When my computer laptop gets hot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then my microphone starts breaking off.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got to get the got to get the Logitech's
got to get the good the Carl Zeiss lens.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember trying to buy a good a good
video webcam for a computer is not as easy
[SPEAKER_09]: as it would.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought there would be way better
versions of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're just kind of they kind of tap
out at around 100 in a bit and just not
[SPEAKER_09]: that great.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what's in the world of cannabis this
week?
[SPEAKER_09]: What have we been hearing in the world of
cannabis this week?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, so what was that with discussion
about hash versus oil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was really I saw Addison had made a
post.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm sick of arguing with hash
makers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just the minute I saw it,
I was like, he's not arguing with hash
[SPEAKER_09]: makers.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's arguing with oil makers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess maybe it's semantics.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's just me, because most people
weren't.
[SPEAKER_09]: In agreement at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also think most people who are oil
smokers want their oil to be hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: But hash smokers never call their hash
oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's this very strange thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, for me, I have nothing against oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're selling Terp oil in the bubble man
pen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's literally designed for oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you have to make oil out of the
hash before you can get it in there type
[SPEAKER_09]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: But not only that, but you're taking the
dry sip and making rosin out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is practically fucking oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it is oil to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, oil to me is just dissolved heads
that have been extracted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, I'm getting FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, and I've always just, you know,
from the book Hashish and from I've always
[SPEAKER_09]: considered it's my sister.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll phone me like 25 more times.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always thought that oil and hash are
different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thus the wording.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess these people have decided that oil
and hash are not different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can disagree.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really the end of the world by
any means.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in my opinion, and that's maybe all it
is, there's a reason why we call oil oil
[SPEAKER_09]: and why we call hashish hashish.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's not a fact for everyone,
but I couldn't believe the conversation,
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just shaking my head completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It became a personal attack, but it's
always kind of like I think you Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's semantics in a way, but I remember
growing up that there was hash and then
[SPEAKER_07]: there was hash oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were two different categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was also weed oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it didn't matter that it came from the
same plant or that basically if it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: oil from the secretory gland itself and
you're somehow milking the oil out in an
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction process or whatever process,
you have a way of basically making a
[SPEAKER_07]: liquid extract, which I guess is oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, oil or as a chemist,
you would think that oil has got to be a
[SPEAKER_07]: liquid, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what was that one comment?
[SPEAKER_07]: If it doesn't bounce, it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was this guy, Sam Wayne Smith.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, if it doesn't bounce at 72
degrees, but then he completely counter
[SPEAKER_09]: contradicted himself in the post prior to
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he also said something about
extracting cellulose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all know that these cells,
the secretory cells and the disc cells
[SPEAKER_07]: from the great work of Paul Mauburg is all
lipid based.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are lipid structures and those are
not cellulosic structures at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so to bring cellulose into the game is
just I don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the whole bouncing thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, it depends on what
temperature because you could make oil
[SPEAKER_07]: bounce at a really low temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, it wasn't about bouncing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have dissolved the heads and they
are now liquefied.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they are microencapsulated resin
glands, resin heads, this is hashish.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, as a chemist, do you consider
hash and oil to be the same?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand your distinction,
which is sort of like one is mechanically
[SPEAKER_07]: removed in place microencapsulated and the
other is just completely dissolved and
[SPEAKER_07]: scrambled into this mixture of soup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not putting one above the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when people hear me say hash is
not oil, it's because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see the oil community want oil to be
hashed so badly they're making it so.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just saying it's hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm saying hash has always been
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your opinion on this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because let's be honest, I guess in the
end, it's all really just opinions.
[SPEAKER_09]: But wow, did it ever turn into a total
personal attack on me because I said,
[SPEAKER_09]: in my opinion, hash is not oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with you, Marcus, except for rosin
is kind of I mean, is it really an oil or
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, because not all rosin is oily.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some rosin is not oily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some is buttery, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can I call it hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because we're just looking for a
designation for where the concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: there and why is the closest we can come
to is hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't separated it into its own
separate category of extraction or
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction methodology as much as we've
just kind of all lumped everything into
[SPEAKER_02]: what the concentrate is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we refer to them as concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in all reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, first things we came up with
when we can't when it came out was what do
[SPEAKER_02]: we call this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it looked really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started to call it earwax because
that's the closest it looked to a color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inconsistency, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more of nomenclature that's come
across the board than anybody sit there
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting there dictating this is,
you know, hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you in principle, but I still refer
to it as hash oil because of back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s, when I originally started to see it
through through extraction methods,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was this one cat here in the Bay
Area.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to wear a cat in the hat hat all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was an old cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came around with hash oil
originally that I had seen in very small
[SPEAKER_02]: vials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then it was like a thousand
dollars or something a vial he was talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried it once and it knocked me on
my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the highest I'd ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was I want to say it was 93,
93, 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dark, but it was closer to golden
than it was a black oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first time he had ever seen
a kind of a golden oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this guy would only show up at rallies
and he was very kind of much a dick and
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he passed away, I do believe,
in the 90s as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't see anything close to that
until we started to see what we called
[SPEAKER_02]: honey bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because early on there was no
way for us to deal or nobody was really
[SPEAKER_02]: sure how to handle this wax substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they basically liquefied it and sprayed
it onto lower to mid grade buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the buds were saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that way we could put it into a
bong and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, you have to understand
kids, there was none of this dabbing
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This all kind of really creeped out in the
2009, 2010.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was hot knifing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in our case, we would use the old coals
where you'd have to wait with the
[SPEAKER_02]: gunpowder in the coal and you'd have to
wait for all the gunpowder to burn off
[SPEAKER_02]: first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then scrape away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled awful in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would take a dot of it and put it on
aluminum foil and then hold a lighter
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath the aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And chase the dragon.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hollowed out big pen.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I wanted to talk about
was these differences.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I said in that thread
was that, you know, I said I grew up in
[SPEAKER_09]: the 70s and the 80s and we had weed oil
and we had hash oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hash oil was simply hash oil that was
made from hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Weed oil was oil that was made from herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some guy came in and he laughed
at me and he said, oh, so you're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: say that, you know, it's different from
this, from that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, well, it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just was.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was back then.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like hash oil was much thicker and
stronger and heavier than the same oil
[SPEAKER_09]: made from herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not to mention it was messier,
stickier, and you didn't have any tools or
[SPEAKER_02]: any way to figure out how to.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you had both of them, there was no way
you couldn't see the strong differences.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for me, you know, I also would say that
making why I think hash and oil are so
[SPEAKER_09]: different is because extracting with a
polar or a non-polar solvent is extracting
[SPEAKER_09]: different things than when extracting with
mechanical screen separation.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not extracting the same things
exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are by nature different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And man, did I get attacked by a lot of
people that think they know what they're
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking talking about in that thread.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I could invite them all in to sort
of speak their piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a valid discussion because it's
one that needs an embarkation from where
[SPEAKER_02]: we are because it's stated, you know,
common knowledge is a type of hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We listed under concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I think it is a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a proper nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than just hash sort of qualifying,
like what a material is, it's more hash to
[SPEAKER_07]: me anyway, says more about how it's made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more about the process by which it's
made and not necessarily the end product.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hugely what represents the end
product, how it's made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can't you can't reincorporate
after you've dissolved stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you've got it's a difference
between CO2 as well as what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: extracting from BHO.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're isolating particular gland
heads by micron size and oil is dissolving
[SPEAKER_09]: every single gland head bulbous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can I can see why the connotation
or the understanding is that way,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's still a form of to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only nomenclature that they know is
hash or a type of hash, because that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis resin concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I understand the
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think we have, you know,
you know what you need to do then?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we need to put out white papers,
you know, a proper discussion,
[SPEAKER_02]: break down and put it out, circulate
something like that and discuss it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a it's a valid discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a valid point of breakdown of
nomenclature, which I do believe needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: be, you know, dealt with a certain level
so that, you know, you can deal with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, water extraction versus,
you know, butane extraction versus,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, rosin, because rosin is a
different, you know, beast altogether than
[SPEAKER_02]: either BHO or PHO or, you know,
CO2 itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each extraction, I don't know,
does it then justify its own name
[SPEAKER_02]: nomenclature?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at a certain resolve, this
discussion is bringing that division up so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can have an understanding,
because the consumer doesn't have an
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding as much as what they have
access to or read or hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, when I first I went back to West
Virginia in 2013, friends were telling me,
[SPEAKER_02]: have you heard about this stuff called
earwax?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went down to the local bong shop
there and they've got full rigs and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it spread was pretty quick,
but the hash itself spread faster than the
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of the process or a
breakdown of what the concentrate is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about that, Sam?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there should be individual
name classifications per process?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think in the near future, I will be
releasing my new patented varieties,
[SPEAKER_12]: which have resin heads the size of grapes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you just squeeze it and people won't be
doing extractions anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: There won't be any need.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll just be picking grapes off and
having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we make sure those grapes are
seedless?
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be horrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't think it's really a big deal
that they're different.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that it's funny that oil
seems to the oil community wants oil to be
[SPEAKER_09]: hashish so desperately.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just from where I just don't see
it as being hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be included.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get why they want to be included.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they could separate themselves
properly by actually saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are different and we're this and then
back what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're confused to a certain result
because they should be happy with being
[SPEAKER_12]: stronger than almost all commercially
produced in imported hashish.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the extracts can easily, you know,
beat them in the dust with both turpentine
[SPEAKER_12]: and cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why my medicine is
predominantly that nowadays because of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still call it hash, you know,
because that's as close as people can
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcus, I'm not necessarily trying to say
or undermine the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just people for the most part less
than one percent of us are aware of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as it is when we're kind of at
that that spearhead again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could change that ripples through
if we, you know, we take the discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously so that they can realize,
you know, I am a particular process that
[SPEAKER_02]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore we should this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand why they're lumping
themselves into hash, because that's as
[SPEAKER_02]: close to a denomination as they can get
nomenclature wise.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe in the consumer knowing what
it is, especially anything to do with
[SPEAKER_12]: health and safety.
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's any compromise whatsoever for
any reason, then the consumer should be
[SPEAKER_12]: aware of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, here's what I'm having a discussion.
[SPEAKER_12]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, we're having a discussion currently
if it is a worthy discussion to gather the
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer grown of that particular flower
listed along with the other information
[SPEAKER_02]: such as potency.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're an organic grower, it might be
fairly important.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a chemical grower, then I'm not
sure how important it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's a if it's a chemical NPK,
then it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some patients were asking,
you know, well, what was this originally
[SPEAKER_02]: grown with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started me to think that,
well, this was an older consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say she was probably in her mid to
late 50s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she asked a very legitimate question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what fertilizer was grown with this
in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was behind the counter doing my own
transaction on the side, I started to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about, you know, that's a very valid
point of of notification, because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: something that we've ever considered or
had much less the base of testing and
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is the consumer as you're watching,
are you the consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you concerned about the fertilizer
that's grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: Only you just care about the end product,
you know, care how it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's produced with versus what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a growing number of consumers that
care how their cannabis or tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_12]: food in general is grown.
[SPEAKER_12]: That said, the vast majority of Americans
don't seem to give a flying fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they GMO corn and they chemically
fertilized corn.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the way the universe works.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's the first time it's the first
time in the history of the world that poor
[SPEAKER_09]: people are obese.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a crazy America.
[SPEAKER_12]: America believes in that food stamps and
TV and high fructose corn syrup,
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what makes up the food stamps.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what you can buy with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've always considered as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when I smoke hash and I, when I smoke
oil and I only smoke rosin, that's the
[SPEAKER_09]: only oil I smoke, but I can tell you that
they're different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was loud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not the same in my opinion from
even the highs that they give from the
[SPEAKER_09]: same material, hitting an oil from
something and even hitting different
[SPEAKER_09]: micron gland heads from the same cultivar
can produce, you know, slightly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a different high, high from
the resin from the VHO from just the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: heads themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's why we make it differently
and why people have preferences.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I think also one of the major
problems I had with Addison's comment was
[SPEAKER_09]: that he's a founder in steep hill,
a lab, a lab for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just felt like, shouldn't we use
like the, like the proper sort of like,
[SPEAKER_09]: when we're speaking about these things,
like you're a person that's going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: informing the majority of people,
you're testing cannabis, you're testing
[SPEAKER_09]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we just need scientists
and peer review.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the same way that we're still
having difficult with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Clark pointed out a few years ago now
that Indica and Sativa are not what we
[SPEAKER_02]: thought they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have to change or start to spark
this discussion, you know, that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: changes, you know, this concept,
the, the, the definition of these
[SPEAKER_02]: concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to concentrate nomenclatures,
you know, because they are different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I love Addison, I worked
with Addison originally way back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day and dealing with testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but at the same time, there's no
different scientific classification or
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been presented to say otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see why he would say currently it
is, is, but I understand what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a valid discussion
because concentrates are a whole other
[SPEAKER_02]: level of discussion than they were 10,
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, thanks to you by having
your bubble bags and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have eight to 10 varieties of bubble
hash, as well as eight to 10 varieties of
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the full spectrum, you know,
and so it's now it's left to the consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: to decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you know, you're the scientists,
you're the people who can break down
[SPEAKER_02]: information properly and disseminate it in
white papers so that you can get peer
[SPEAKER_02]: review so that you can then change the
discussion as opposed to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Eventually, Ed Chan, the old lady that
came in and asked about what the
[SPEAKER_12]: fertilizer, was that for buds or was that
for an extract?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was for buds, but I mean,
eventually she's going to be doing it for
[SPEAKER_12]: extracts too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I was thinking and I
started a discussion with my, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my purchasers is, you know, should we
just, how would we gather this
[SPEAKER_02]: information?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it make it to where it needs to
go?
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as, you know, is it valid or
worthy information to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just a waste of time currently,
or is this another way that we can set
[SPEAKER_02]: trend by, you know, now posting the type
of growth methodologies that goes along
[SPEAKER_02]: with it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing you can do is start collecting
the information voluntarily from the
[SPEAKER_12]: growers and get feedback from the people
who buy it and see are there preferences
[SPEAKER_12]: towards particular fertilization regimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a, you know, it's going to take
time, but I've already started gathering
[SPEAKER_02]: that information so that we could learn,
you know, because it's part of our work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because when the consumers are
now asking for it, and since I am,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a pioneering dispensary person,
you know, I think of new ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: disseminate or gather information for the
consumer because it makes a difference for
[SPEAKER_02]: me when I go to a Whole Foods or any,
you know, store, do I buy conventional or
[SPEAKER_02]: organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to go organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I have that option or I can
afford that option, that's not always the
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I can, you know, I do think about
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I prefer organic as long as it tastes as
good or better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer organic every single time because
to say it's not organic means that
[SPEAKER_06]: chemicals were sprayed on the earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Infecting animals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Infecting everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the same time... How are we
getting away with something there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, we saved some money,
so we're good, but nothing else is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with you, but I unfortunately eat
for taste.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if something tastes better,
as long as it's not dangerous,
[SPEAKER_12]: then I would prefer it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with what you're saying,
but I'm addicted to taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're in luck because organic food
a hundred times, you know, always tastes
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're pretty much good to go on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's two different types of taste.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the organic, delicious,
sustaining life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's the toxic chemical Monsanto,
which convinces your brain it's delicious
[SPEAKER_09]: while simultaneously poisoning your body
and those around you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is what we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the position we're in,
in every decision we make.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time we open our mouth, it's
interesting to hear from the connoisseur
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective, like, and then have for us
come in and you realize, no, you don't
[SPEAKER_09]: understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like these chemicals will absolutely
affect these children, these sensitive,
[SPEAKER_09]: sensitive being.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't mean chemicals as much as
chemical fertilizers, because in a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: countries they will use one particular of
NPK because their soil is deficient in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And without it, they get really super poor
yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which plant material and biomass can help
a lot better than chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been a biodynamic farmer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was taught by Alan Chadwick.
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand you don't need to preach to
me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm converted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel like I'm preaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Hatch Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Hatch Church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to clarify is that I've had some
wonderful organic fruit that tasted like
[SPEAKER_02]: shit before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't make it, everything
absolutely tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had bad tasting stuff before too,
but for the most part, I agree is that it
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like if you do something proper,
you know, it brings out the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings out the, you know, everything
that you want, you know, and I prefer
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's homegrown something that's
supposed to a math producer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: In general, it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't mind talking really quickly
about how like amendments and fertilizers
[SPEAKER_06]: do affect medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for us to just look at it as a
connoisseur, you know, aspect makes it
[SPEAKER_06]: really difficult because there's a whole
growing process that goes into it and all
[SPEAKER_06]: of the nutrients and inputs that goes into
it are really all part of the factor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get tons of people that want to know
how medicine is grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really, really important to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they find out that, wow,
this medicine tastes really good,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was grown in a way that was
ecologically supporting nature and the
[SPEAKER_06]: environment, they're all over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to have anything to do
with chemicals, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're finding that to be a really,
really important part of the selling point
[SPEAKER_06]: for farms, because they get to tell their
story.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get to show how they're supporting
bee populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, I know a lot of farmers,
we work at the Tona Farms, and they have
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe worked synthetically or in chemical
regimens before and then turned over
[SPEAKER_06]: towards organics or towards even plant
material or Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_06]: methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're getting higher cannabinoid
counts and higher terpene levels through
[SPEAKER_06]: those methods.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that there is a lot of reasons
why it's really important about what we
[SPEAKER_06]: put into the medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it can create a high grade product
in the end, it's a huge selling point
[SPEAKER_06]: because people really are behind it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that I wanted to A,
welcome you to the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also welcome Wade into the room from
House of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also welcome D420K into the room from
the House of Gnar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And fucking welcome Forrest into the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're all doing well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't miss anyone, did I?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, those were the newbies.
[SPEAKER_09]: D's been in the room for like an hour or a
half an hour, and I just welcomed him now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't interrupt you guys'
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty deep stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even fit in a ball rip in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just trying to get into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love when Forrest and Wade come into the
conversation because it really,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and something that you said,
Joshua, in regards to we have to take it
[SPEAKER_09]: beyond the connoisseur sort of level.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet at the same time, it really has been
some of the most OCD connoisseurs who have
[SPEAKER_09]: maintained and stewarded this plant,
this medicine to a point where the people
[SPEAKER_09]: who are like, oh, this is the most special
thing right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like I've been, it's for my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's for, you know, we've been sharing it
for 20.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems that there's a really interesting
transition from those, the same way that
[SPEAKER_09]: particular plant makes someone feel
incredible through their recreational
[SPEAKER_09]: feelings or adult use, that it translates
over to some very powerful medicine
[SPEAKER_09]: versus, you know, buying some Maxi Schwag
off the street or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Sam knows, the biodynamic effects do
bring out amazing qualities in cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: and food.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why it's still around.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many years have you been growing
cannabis biodynamically?
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I have been up here for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, biodynamics,
how about this?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I've been doing it twice as
long.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I believe in it and it's the way I
personally do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also know that most farms are not
biodynamic, be they for vegetables,
[SPEAKER_12]: fruits or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would be better if more
were.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's hard to convince some
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the proof is in the puffing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you were doing back in the day,
Sam, when I first met you, whatever you
[SPEAKER_09]: were doing, whatever you were growing,
I can honestly say to this day that was
[SPEAKER_09]: grown biodynamically organically.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's ever put anything like that is
really seriously medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is like medicine that frightened my
soul.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I've never been high like that in my
life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that is that you could probably eat
enough of that and operate on a person
[SPEAKER_09]: like you would knock them unconscious for
36 hours if you ate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever get knocked out by eating
that resin, Sam?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what happened to me a few times when
I made no baked cookies, I would make them
[SPEAKER_12]: with a half a gram or a gram of THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: So each one would have one gram or even
two grams of the dry sift that was 50
[SPEAKER_12]: percent THC by weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you have an emulsifier in those
cookies to break it down?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they were putting ghee and also to
activate them.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were double-boiled in ghee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So clarified butter and then powdered
sugar and powdered cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a trip ticket to another
dimension.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the one gram was quite strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: A few people who ate a few of those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, when you took a bite out of them,
it was like the strongest biting this
[SPEAKER_12]: peppery taste from the resin that you've
ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they were really, really rich in
terpenes because it's not THC that has
[SPEAKER_12]: that bitter bite.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it strange that this plant gets made
illegal so long ago?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got these incredible properties,
but it seems that people who want to get
[SPEAKER_09]: high are the people who are the stewards
for all of these years while they're
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to eradicate it and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep going back to that transition of
the hashish eaters getting their teeth
[SPEAKER_09]: wrenched out in the 14th century in the
Cairo Square compared to now where it's
[SPEAKER_09]: just opening up and it's just so much
bigger than adult use now as we're all
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing and learning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would have ever thought 20 years ago
that cannabis would be getting credit for
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the things that it's now being
credited for?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I honestly did believe in all of
these medical applications, even ones that
[SPEAKER_12]: we hadn't heard of yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: I expected them to be found with each
different cannabinoid, with each different
[SPEAKER_12]: terpene combination.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to modify it for other medical
indications.
[SPEAKER_12]: I expected it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was more of the school of like,
I thought it was burning out my brain
[SPEAKER_09]: cells when I was like 14, 15 puffing
joints.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just figured that's what it was doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: As I met people like Hilary Black and
yourself and many others, I realized that,
[SPEAKER_09]: wow, this is unbelievable just how
actually helpful people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true that in the 1800s and a lot of
the apothecaries and in the Victorian era,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis was a base of tons of medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like we had to force ourselves
to teach ourselves that it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to force it down our throats that
kills brain cells and monkey brain cells
[SPEAKER_06]: and all that for us to totally forget
about it en masse so that we could totally
[SPEAKER_06]: rediscover it and find out, wow,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an incredible awakening.
[SPEAKER_06]: With all the labs, even though some of the
labs are talking controversial stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: they have helped us get to a lot of really
good information and it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Without the labs, nobody would have CBD
varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody loves their CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forrest, we were having a discussion right
before you came on regarding a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard us in our
discussion prior.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a patient come in and she was
wondering what fertilizers were used on
[SPEAKER_02]: the product and how they were grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've started the discussion to the point
where we're actually gathering or doing
[SPEAKER_02]: our best to gather from the farmers as
they come in is what they actually grew it
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having the discussion, do you think
it's beneficial?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I know with you it's probably a
no-brainer, but I'd like to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's absolutely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of fertilizers that can be
relatively harmless, but whatever you put
[SPEAKER_03]: into the ground, it's going to be in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's amazing about cannabis and
that's what you have to be responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: about it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take what's in that soil and
make it part of itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks want it to be black and
white, good and bad, right and wrong,
[SPEAKER_03]: evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are fertilizers that can be really
beneficial and healthy for the plant that
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant needs for a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that fertilizer doesn't
necessarily mean miracle grow or some
[SPEAKER_03]: man-made compound even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Building living soil can be done without a
lot of toxic things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a survey for growers coming in,
especially as an establishment,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is working with patients is a great
practice to say, here's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then how is the medicine made?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're using certain fertilizers,
you have certain practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big difference on if you're
making a medicine from the flower or just
[SPEAKER_03]: selling flowers or making extract from
flowers versus if you're making that
[SPEAKER_03]: extract through roots and stocks and stems
and calling a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your risk goes up higher there because
that's where the plant stores a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds that could potentially be risky
as we learn more about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about this here before,
but we learn more about certain metals or
[SPEAKER_03]: toxins that can be stored in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's hard to be black and white
as far as what's good, what's stored
[SPEAKER_03]: where, how is it transferred with the
exception of systemic pesticides that we
[SPEAKER_03]: see coming in even second and third
generations with plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is, I think if you as a
business owner, are being responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to say, well, here's the
information, at least giving the consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: the ability to look at it and make a
decision for themselves, then that's as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as we can do at this point because we
are still learning about how much is
[SPEAKER_03]: transferred where and what is how it
affects the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're working with children who are
as young as six months old, we have a zero
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance policy because certain
pesticides and compounds we know are
[SPEAKER_03]: toxic, and then others, well, the science
is still out, we're looking at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we play on the safe side either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with a lot of medicine right now,
a lot of people just don't understand that
[SPEAKER_03]: what is missing is just the information
there for the consumer to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: decision that is best for them,
not necessarily having to have everything
[SPEAKER_03]: on some sort of standard that is the
standard that I would expect with
[SPEAKER_03]: children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because not everyone needs, if I were
going to get a product, and this is where
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the future of cannabis,
especially when it comes to pricing and
[SPEAKER_03]: economics, is a grading type of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need, as a full grown adult and
I'm not treating health conditions,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I wanted to go get some flowers,
what would be safe for me is a completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different grading scale than what would be
safe for maybe some other people with
[SPEAKER_03]: immunocompromised systems and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on the side of just the information
should be there so that people who know
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're using it for can get medicine
that is appropriate for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely agree with you, and I'll be
happy to grow it for you outdoors where
[SPEAKER_12]: the birds might poop on it a little tiny
bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question for you, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you noticed any differences?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure a lot of parents notice the
differences in the cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: profiles and how those can change and help
and maybe not help.
[SPEAKER_09]: But have you ever noticed differences in
how the medicine was extracted,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it was an oil, whether it was made
with mechanical screen separations?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you notice differences in those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why, and I'll tell everyone here,
we at the Collider's Network, we're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: ethanol extraction, organic ethanol
extraction, which a lot of people might
[SPEAKER_03]: shake, like, oh, that's not the best way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, for one, we're fortunate to
have a lot of lab testing, so we make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: we have no solvents and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason we settled on that as
opposed to, like, even CO2 right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: because of an efficacy difference that
we've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, without going into that,
ethanol extraction isn't just one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people hear that and they say,
well, I do that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I like to use the example
of we can give everybody, you can give me
[SPEAKER_03]: the ingredients for a beef Wellington,
and you can give me you can give Gordon
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramsay the ingredients for a beef
Wellington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because we have the same thing
and the same equipment doesn't mean we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get the same product at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we spent years, you know, really trying
to refine our methods so that we can get a
[SPEAKER_03]: really whole plant representation of the
oils and the flavonoids and turpenoids in
[SPEAKER_03]: it that I feel like I've missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't see the same efficacy with
some of those other processes that are
[SPEAKER_03]: really good at stripping out a lot of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get these beautiful,
golden, transparent ambers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we went to use some of the
medicines, we just didn't see some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just made the determination that,
well, with our limited resources and our
[SPEAKER_03]: need for whatever was missing out of these
two, we settled on this this other
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction method specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we saw a more pure and pretty
looking product with some of the CO2,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, closed loop systems,
the efficacy wasn't anywhere near as good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my logic would tell me that
something was taken out during that
[SPEAKER_03]: process that was having medical benefit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Forest, for your information,
if you use an ultrasonic shaker with an
[SPEAKER_12]: ethanol bath and you put whatever you want
extracted into that for about 30 seconds
[SPEAKER_12]: while you're shaking it, the oil will come
out light yellow.
[SPEAKER_12]: You only get about 80 percent yield.
[SPEAKER_12]: You lose about 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can then extract that with ethanol
in the way you've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then you'll get oil that is so pretty
that you won't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we have oil that is and I
could run and grab some, though it
[SPEAKER_03]: probably wouldn't look you wouldn't be
able to tell over the webcam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amber, it's not, you know, it's not that
sludgy chlorophyll filled sort of rock
[SPEAKER_12]: pot.
[SPEAKER_12]: The longer you soak it and the higher the
temperature of the ethanol, the darker and
[SPEAKER_12]: greener it gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do very short soaps and those sort
of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a long answer to a short question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all that led through seeing
differences in inefficacy that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: have to do with what is and isn't filtered
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are you administering the extract?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this in the sublingual tincture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, for the most part, it's
considered internal because sublingual,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, would be holding under the
tongue and a lot of kids are cooperative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though internal dosing is probably
the least efficient and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the liver removes a lot of it before it
even becomes really effective in the
[SPEAKER_03]: system with with kids and people who have
development delays, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: always have the most understanding or
cooperative patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get it in them however we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, sublingual and internally.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the extract analyzed for in terms
of cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that again, I broke up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the extract analyzed for in terms
of cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, we do a full cannabinoid
profile and then pesticides, microbiome,
[SPEAKER_03]: residual solvents, you know, those sort of
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it like 60 percent or 70 percent
cannabinoids or?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say on the average between we are
just come out between like 65 and 75.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in that window.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I was asking about the
different types of medicine, my friend
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheryl Rose, her daughter Haley,
who's local here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_09]: also has LGS, I guess got diagnosed when
she was quite young, like seven or eight
[SPEAKER_09]: years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they found this Haley's Comet,
this high CBD cultivar that worked for
[SPEAKER_09]: her.
[SPEAKER_09]: They named it after her, Haley's Comet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was getting quite relief from
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just something interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never really talked about it much.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I didn't want to sound like like
I was trying to promote my company,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I had given her bags so that she could
make different medicines for Haley.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess in the end, she started giving
her this bubble in capsules instead of the
[SPEAKER_09]: oil she was making.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was the first time Haley had ever
gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was 100 or 200 days without a
seizure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the longest time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, the oil and stuff cut
her seizures down by like 90 percent or
[SPEAKER_09]: something, but it didn't completely
eliminate them.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was only until she started making
bubble hash and putting all the different
[SPEAKER_09]: micron hashes inside the capsules that
that she got this incredible, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: like I'm pretty sure it was over 100 days,
which I don't think Haley had had ever
[SPEAKER_09]: gone 100 days in her entire life since she
was diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the ratio of that strain?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me look it up real quick for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only ask because it is I used to
hesitate saying things like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, like everybody else,
the more families you work with,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more confident you get seeing
patterns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing to me how many more kids
respond to a two to one between one to two
[SPEAKER_03]: and two to one in that range ratio
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: More so than the 20 to one high CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one to one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So especially with LGS and when I talk to
parents, because a lot of people come or
[SPEAKER_03]: people are treating, we just CNN really
helped boost this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that was not that they did
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They brought a lot of good attention to
the subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the negatives that came along
with that was the CBD felt good and safe
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk about for ideological reasons and
not necessarily because that was what they
[SPEAKER_03]: had discovered was the best medicine for
these conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just felt safe to say,
well, this one doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to max out this and give
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And CBD has some benefits in that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the benefits are really when you start
adding THC to it, the benefits are more
[SPEAKER_03]: than doubled than when they're isolated
THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen that with a lot of kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have some reduction with
Charlotte's Web or some of those high ACDC
[SPEAKER_03]: or high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you start to get closer to a more
balanced profile, you start to see some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those dramatic results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I experienced that with my
own son.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never had a single day without a
seizure on high CBD meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what we started with,
because that's what we had heard six years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago as parents and almost gave up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we thought, well, I guess the CBD,
you know, it's what they say is good for
[SPEAKER_03]: kids, but it's not working for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, through doing research and
work with sports.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you using your alcohol extract to make
distillate or using the alcohol extract in
[SPEAKER_07]: the in the capsule or in the in the
formulation itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to see if I have any here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can run and grab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's like full extract fecal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it full extract cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not you're not rising and
distilling or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so we measure that we test that
we measure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, hey, there's some way it's got
some it's made by our group right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it still terpene rich?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You open that the lid on that thing and it
smells like a fruit basket.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got these beautiful terpenes besides
the THC might also be contributing to the
[SPEAKER_12]: additional for the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a big I am sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know there's still some debate
in the scientific community about the
[SPEAKER_03]: entourage effect, but there's no debate in
my experience because we've just seen it
[SPEAKER_03]: too many times where we've recreated the
exact same base cannabinoid profile,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your CBD, your THC, your CBG as much as
you can and how that translates or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you guys understand,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've we've had straight shift and been
forced because we've run out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we with lab testing, been able to
recreate those profiles and seen
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely night and day into the spectrum
as far as efficacy with kids, where at
[SPEAKER_03]: times you can actually even see adverse
effects, where when we went back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: strain that was originally there,
same cannabinoid profile, you then see the
[SPEAKER_03]: same positive benefits come back.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason I was mentioning this was
because a lot of these 20 to one CBD to
[SPEAKER_12]: THC ratios varieties have quite
consistently different terpene flavor and
[SPEAKER_12]: aromas than varieties that are higher in
THC and have been selected for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I've I've noticed that as well,
I mean, you see, you know, I know that a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the R4s and Charles Webb lineage
have a lot of liming, pining sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: smells to them when they're growing that
we don't see with some other strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as much as those the karyophylline
black pepper sort of funk that you get
[SPEAKER_03]: with with other balanced ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, it's it's I think the
answer is in a combination of both.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the answer also is whatever helps the
patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's exactly it for,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So saying that, saying that, OK,
we've seen better results with a more
[SPEAKER_03]: balanced cannabinoid ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can give you an example of 10 kids
where that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some kids or people,
you know, I work with kids and adults,
[SPEAKER_03]: but some mostly kids respond poorly to
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you get the same diagnosis
and they need exact opposite medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way I try to help people visualize
this is just understanding the concept
[SPEAKER_03]: that when you see a, you know,
sort of stick on this thing, because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that's forest theme, but it's a
good one to visualize if you just stick
[SPEAKER_03]: with a seizure.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see a seizure happening,
you're seeing the consequence of something
[SPEAKER_03]: broken in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have two people with seizures
and the doctor observes those symptoms and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get a similar diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam, you get that diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That diagnosis doesn't correlate with what
might have broken down in the system to
[SPEAKER_03]: manifest those consequences, those
seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And different parts of, just to
oversimplify it a bit, let's just stick
[SPEAKER_03]: with the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different parts of that system can go
wrong and manifest the same problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could not be producing, as you guys
know, anandamide 2 AG.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have a down regulation issue
with the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could not have the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is necessary to break down and cause
the reaction when an andamide or THC bond
[SPEAKER_03]: to the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just three different real quick
examples of things, three different things
[SPEAKER_03]: that could be going wrong in the system
that are going to manifest the same
[SPEAKER_03]: seizure when the endocannabinoid system is
not able to regulate neurotransmitter
[SPEAKER_03]: function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know these different cannabinoids
profiles and terpene profiles interact
[SPEAKER_03]: with these receptors differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cause different reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cause anandamide to build up in the
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interact with the receptors in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is really the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Logic would tell me that this is really
why we see some people with the same
[SPEAKER_03]: symptoms, but need different approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because although we can see the symptom,
we can't see what's going wrong in the
[SPEAKER_03]: body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So teaching people how to take an
efficient approach to seeing what works
[SPEAKER_03]: for them is really the trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes back to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do they tell patients when they
come in looking for things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is feeling comfortable telling
patients, well, it could be a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different things that you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we teach you how to most
efficiently find what your body needs?
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to tell them, no, you need
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this doesn't work, then you're s
out of luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gives them the wrong impression of
what might help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they could walk away prematurely when
there's still an answer there for them
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: What fish song comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on a big fish rant last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I was just gonna ask one more thing
about concentrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you talked about that extract being
somewhere between 65 to 70% cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then you take that and you cut that
with like another oil vehicle,
[SPEAKER_07]: like coconut oil or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your ratio when you make the oil
that actually is going in?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that helps us understand, again,
the level of cannabinoids that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: getting in these doses and whether or not
the efficacy is always gonna be a function
[SPEAKER_07]: of how much they're getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it like a 10 to 1 dilution of that
extract?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: he got muted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Forrest, I muted you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were talking to someone
else.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just reaching behind me in my
bag of tricks here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the benefit of having different,
I look at it, the more I've worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: this, the less I look at strain names and
I look at the test results and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, we have a palette of cannabinoids,
turpenoids, flavonoids that we can work
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from there, you know, Mark,
we're able to really dial in what that
[SPEAKER_03]: individual person needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have your extract,
right, so this is some nice pineapple jack
[SPEAKER_03]: THC extract labeled and tested,
ready to go, measured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know exactly, well, exactly within
testing range.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that analytical testing varies
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're able to take that and I can say,
okay, well, I have the amount of THC and a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular terpene profile with that,
but maybe this person, is showing that
[SPEAKER_03]: they are also responding to acidic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can take some rosin that we've had
pressed here that is also acidic,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's bubbly goodness there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, work with then adding in specific
THCA and CBDA and THCVA and some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: other compounds and basically then build a
customized medicine for that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we get into, you know,
I work really with rare, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: neurological conditions a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it ends up being very individualized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're able to take that medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I use typically MCT oil unless
they have a sensitivity to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are doing that these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's actually studies that show
it's a preferred vehicle for getting quick
[SPEAKER_07]: onset of activity in the oral mucosa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's a real good choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the ratio that you use?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would, and we're like, if people are
listening and they want to, again,
[SPEAKER_07]: create their own products, I mean,
how would you, I always thought that the
[SPEAKER_07]: best way to do is to like dose until you
actually feel cannabinoids in the patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you know that you can titrate them
up to the level where you're agonizing
[SPEAKER_07]: CB1, maybe you want to dial back from
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So would you start a patient, especially a
child patient at say like a 20 milligram
[SPEAKER_07]: per day dose or 10 milligrams or five
milligrams?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the right place to start to sort of
look to titrate up to that level of where
[SPEAKER_07]: you know you're getting cannabinoids in
there, but you're not doing it in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that completely incapacitates the child or
the patient to where they have to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, get dizzy or just other
patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I find is that they don't want to
take the medicine anymore because they
[SPEAKER_07]: don't like the way it feels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think it's really important to
titrate their body up to that level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that tells you that you're getting
cannabinoids into their system,
[SPEAKER_07]: but maybe dial back the daily dose so they
can still be functional and not be dizzy
[SPEAKER_07]: and not feel disoriented.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what advice would you give,
especially parents?
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Mishulam in Israel find that really
young children, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: two, three, four, five, don't get high
when they're given THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've seen, I've seen children take
doses that have blown my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to meet with this parent cause I
want to really double check and make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: they're looking at the test accurately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is 70, maybe no, she's like 45 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's eight years old and is somewhere
around 1800 milligrams a day dosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be an extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody starts at that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're talking about starting
though, I started one, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I started we started, you know,
um, it would be one of those slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We check for, we check for all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's the only way you can
use the physiological response as any
[SPEAKER_07]: indicator to whether or not they're
feeling again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I guess, again, my feeling is I was
trying to work with an older patient who
[SPEAKER_07]: feels very disoriented when she takes like
a a hundred milligram candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're trying to do is,
is, is start with her low and slow,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think especially for children
patients, wouldn't you recommend the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is why we use drops,
you know, it's not, it's not just for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, looks or because people are used
to getting it in droppers.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the main advantages is that you can
control the dose relatively, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: approximately down to the milligram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we start with like a milligram or a
drop, depending on how concentrated the
[SPEAKER_03]: droppers are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another great reason when
you're going from concentrate,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can make that tincture is concentrated
or is diluted as you think is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I, I lean on the side of you
start down at minimum, but you don't also
[SPEAKER_03]: need to dilly dally with titration for
months on end, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we start with a dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make sure there's no adverse reactions,
no rare allergies, nothing that could be
[SPEAKER_03]: throw us a curve ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we just start to titrate up with
times of day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we keep the dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very small might be a milligram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we start, we add in the bedtime
dose and then the noon dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we want to see every four to six
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause our goal is to keep a sustained
level in the system, not spikes and waves,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you're dealing with
neurological type conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, that's, that's sort of our
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we get the four or three
doses, whatever they feel is appropriate a
[SPEAKER_03]: day, then we start titrating up those
doses, like a milligram or two at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doing it that way, we've, I,
I can't actually remember the last time I
[SPEAKER_03]: had someone even complain about being high
because you will see efficacy usually
[SPEAKER_03]: before that happens for most
endocannabinoid regulatory issues,
[SPEAKER_03]: which a lot of these conditions fall
under.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and once you do start to feel
something because you're taking such a
[SPEAKER_03]: methodical slow approach that is not big
jumps in your dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never at the point where this is
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I maybe feel a little relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on the, such the low threshold of,
uh, intoxication or, or psychoactivity
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's never a negative, it's never
been a negative experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're a hundred percent right,
uh, about children and how they process
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, um, I, like I said, and then I've
heard Dr. Russo and other doctors say this
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, have noticed that kids just
process it differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we take that, uh, low and slow
approach, like you said, or low and not
[SPEAKER_03]: too slow, but methodical approach,
you know, we don't, I don't see a real
[SPEAKER_03]: problem with intoxication ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kids who do end up getting,
they titrate up the doses that I know
[SPEAKER_03]: would knock me on my butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've never seen even, you know,
a blurred eye or giggly attitude out of a
[SPEAKER_03]: child.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no sign of any sort of
intoxication whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, each individual
endocannabinoid system has something to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're already deficient and the
receptors aren't being saturated or,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, by anandamide and 2 AG, I think you're
going to be able to tolerate more
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulation through THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those things have something to do
with it, but, um, that's my approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that those heroic doses do
is you got to remember that the
[SPEAKER_07]: metabolites are stored in, in fatty
tissues and fatty organs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's protecting those organs from
free radical damage and oxidative damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also on the burning of adipose
tissue basically releases all that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, systemically.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, humans were evolved to hold
onto these cannabinoids for as long as we
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like most antioxidants like vitamin C
or water soluble, the cannabinoids are fat
[SPEAKER_07]: soluble, which protects fatty tissues from
oxidative damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, that I say, I already said that
I feel like I'm on a, no, I've changed as
[SPEAKER_03]: they go off of certain medications.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's medications that cause you to gain
weight, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all seen that or experienced that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen big time, not just the
removal of the medication influenced
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly the cannabinoid supplement
dose, but as they lose that fat,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the adipose tissue, it's no longer
making those stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the interactions with the
cannabinoid medicines change and have to
[SPEAKER_03]: really make some adjustments because of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a really good point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and the other thing that's different
about, about your product, which I'm very
[SPEAKER_07]: intrigued in, is that in this full plant
extract, you're not winterizing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not removing any of the other
components such that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if your stuff is analyzing for,
let's say the neighborhood of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 70%, there's 30%, other
components in there of terpenes are a
[SPEAKER_07]: sizable fraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's still a pretty sizable
fraction of other extractables that are
[SPEAKER_07]: coming along with the plant that certainly
you may not want in say like a dabble
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrate or dabble product,
because those things are going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those and, and, and degrade, but certainly
in this product format where you're
[SPEAKER_07]: looking to, you know, try to deliver the
whole plant goodness by extracting
[SPEAKER_07]: everything that the plant has to extract.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, there's fatty acids in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lipids in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you point out, there's flavonoids in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the other minor components that are
non cannabinoids might be helping the
[SPEAKER_07]: overall entourage effect of, of
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's good for people to hear that
again, you don't necessarily have to go
[SPEAKER_07]: through making distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now making distillate, I think is,
is a completely valid opportunity again,
[SPEAKER_07]: to make medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from the plant, but I think in this
particular case, what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_07]: is again, it could possibly provide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, for those including the
roots, including the roots for those who
[SPEAKER_07]: used to watch star track, this is like
fire, all weapons, you know, phasers,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, photon torpedoes, you hit them
with everything because if the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: offers this, and again, the plant is a
source of vital nutrition for humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not take it in the extract?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you want to separate it out from
something that again, can provide medical
[SPEAKER_07]: efficacy?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's part of what you're
seeing in the boost of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, we go back and forth on
certain parts of the plant and how to best
[SPEAKER_03]: use it, you know, how, what chlorophylls
impact is in those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I, I agree, there's a lot
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I, I don't have data to
back it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we get into anecdotal data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, when I have a tincture and
I'd be happy to send you guys some to
[SPEAKER_03]: check out that you open the lid and it
just bursts in the room with, with all the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that the plant wants to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what those terpenes are,
is its way of communicating with the world
[SPEAKER_03]: around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, with the evidence that's come out
with some of the entourage studies that
[SPEAKER_03]: are being done and across the board,
the studies have shown that single isolate
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid therapies are not as effective
as therapies that are when you include and
[SPEAKER_03]: reintroduce, you know, THC to a CBD
therapy or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you start to talk about the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That research is being done and it's
pretty conclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each study has shown the efficacy is
increased with the addition of the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: plant cannabinoids and terpenoids as
opposed to isolating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to me, it's just, that's the
direction we're going to go until we have
[SPEAKER_03]: something that points us otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there's some, there are some
terpenoids that are only in the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Dr. Russo's work right now is
just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I take it with a little bit of
caution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where we get back to where we
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's just, I don't want to say
what's right and wrong because who am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all on this journey of researching
and doing what we think is best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that there's some caution
personally with the kids we were working
[SPEAKER_03]: with if we were starting to integrate and
distill and concentrate medicines that
[SPEAKER_03]: were made from roots and stems and things
like that, just strictly because of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis's ability to suck things out of
the soil and store it in its roots and
stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't mean there's not
medically beneficial things in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean that if your soil's good
and your soil's clean and your
[SPEAKER_03]: environment's clean, that that can't be
done safely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gets back to just making sure that
the customer knows what they're buying,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so that they can say,
yeah, this could be great for me as a full
[SPEAKER_03]: grown adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm trying to work with my,
you know, six month old with
[SPEAKER_03]: neuroblastoma, I might avoid some of these
just because there might be something I
[SPEAKER_03]: feel is something to be cautious about.
[SPEAKER_09]: No stems, no seeds that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_09]: Acapulco gold is far out weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're nervous about this bulk CBD coming
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's people now like you can
get gallon CBD oils and it's all just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's essentially medical or not medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's industrial waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's from Asia and Eastern
Europe where they're doing big hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for, for manufacturing reasons
or making hemp products, ropes and
clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever, wallets, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they just bundle all this stuff into a
big hopper at the end of it and just dose
[SPEAKER_03]: it with things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get CBD at the end and they're
able to distill that down and run it
[SPEAKER_03]: through a purifier and, you know,
sell you these gallons of, of purified CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that to me, without having that
information of, you know, where it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: from, how it's made, what's in it,
is it organic?
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff just makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could just be being over
cautious, but, yeah, it's not,
[SPEAKER_03]: not for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should make you nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think people realize that's what
that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's a waste product of the hemp
industry in Asia, not even grown for that
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_12]: In China, it's all grown biodynamically
for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: With, with human poop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's definitely a need for
monomolecular for the isolation of the
[SPEAKER_09]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because then people like Forrest can come
along and find the recipes and add the
[SPEAKER_09]: terpenes and produce those very
specifically accurate cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene profiles that stay accurate every
single time all the way down the line.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas plants with variables,
they can have these little bits of changes
[SPEAKER_09]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see the value.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also see the snake oil salesman aspect.
[SPEAKER_09]: For a long time, I couldn't figure out how
is everyone shipping this stuff when it's
[SPEAKER_09]: not legal to ship.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I realized, oh, okay,
they're shipping hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's been cold pressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because it's a low THC, you know,
there could be CBD cultivar in the
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivar that it, it basically small
amounts of it press into the oil and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're calling that CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_09]: When really it's hemp oil with CBD
contaminant in like super, super small
[SPEAKER_09]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran a bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $189 for a bottle of marketed to kids
and families.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day plus hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we took it to the labs and tested it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was nothing in it, not a
terpene, not a fraction that the machines
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't even pick up CBD, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's essentially, you know,
it's $189 of, you know, I'm assuming hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: seed oil could be olive oil for all I
know, you know, just nothing in it
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear that Mark said.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just probably, probably soybean oil just
because it's the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is absolutely happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you decarboxylating this ethanol
extract or you you're putting it in there
[SPEAKER_07]: and not decarboxylated?
[SPEAKER_03]: You are decarboxylates, but because of
the, the distiller, it is really good at
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature control, but it mostly decarbs
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really good with making acidic
compounds, which is where we've started
[SPEAKER_03]: rinsing out a rosin, you know,
press and starting to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we're, we're decarbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do classes for families up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really try to, we're doing another one
here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the Northern California area
where we actually teach families how to,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to do this and just try to give them
some independence, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's, it's decarbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can all be done at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big advocate of not letting people
convince people that they can't take
[SPEAKER_03]: control of their medicine and do it
safely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy and it's not right for
everybody, especially if they're full-time
[SPEAKER_03]: caregivers to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's different from it being
impossible to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a lot of classes teaching
families, you know, how to do it if they
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to, or at least watching them be
able to know exactly how the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're providing are made and how it's done
safely, how to read test results,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to then use that to make accurately
dose medicines, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: To empower families how to do it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for interrupting you there,
but I have a question for you guys and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering about, are you working or doing
any test studies in utero with pregnant
[SPEAKER_00]: women that, because we're learning about
this as a basic nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also noticed that in children
that are, that we're also treating with
[SPEAKER_00]: the oils that we're making, which is a
whole plant extract as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing that the children who have
had THC or CBD from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, mothers that have ingested
cannabis from the beginning have different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of tolerances than children who,
you know, have never had it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about like a basic nutrient
from the beginning, you know, in a zygote
[SPEAKER_00]: form, I think that's just a really
interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, do you work with women
in pregnancy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny that you bring that
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's known that endocannabinoid
signaling is a huge part of neurological
[SPEAKER_03]: development pre and postnatal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but it's funny, I'm going to jump
to another story real quick, because I do
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of consultations with families from
all over the world, Indonesia,
[SPEAKER_03]: the UK, India, you know, the United
States, of course, Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a mom who I was speaking with
this week who has a very young child,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think seven months old, and infantile
spasms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is not a good sign when your child
starts having infantile spasms of that
[SPEAKER_03]: age.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can quickly be diagnosed as West
syndrome, which then leads into these more
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunate epilepsies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she was in Texas, and the access in
Texas is horrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inhumane would be the word I would use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do have access to what they can
order online, which is although not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily legal, but the lack of
enforcement allows us to get some CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: real CBD products at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was using those CBD products and
not having any luck with her daughter's
[SPEAKER_03]: seizure.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was still having these spasms every
single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a friend of hers gave her THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like a lot of parents, like,
I don't know, I don't know if THC is safe,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm not sure if I should use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she read the, she was going to see if
it was safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what she was thinking as
far as seeing if it was safe, but she's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to try it herself and see if it was,
you know, poison or not okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: She read the label wrong and just totally
dosed herself, like with a 40 or 50
[SPEAKER_03]: milligram dose, which is not something she
does because she's not a cannabis user,
[SPEAKER_03]: was knocked out on the couch for the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, man, it was an experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of made her think, oh,
now I'm nervous to give this to my baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such an intense experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then she called and said that she's
breastfeeding her child.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after she dosed herself with that THC,
her daughter went four days without a
[SPEAKER_03]: seizure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she hadn't gone four days without a
seizure in months and months and months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that really excites me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely work with small children,
especially work with small children and
[SPEAKER_00]: women and children with all different
types of autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're noticing that, you know,
really dosing the mothers with large doses
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC along with the CBD is immediate
response, you know, with the baby and
[SPEAKER_00]: breastfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, it's an
important conversation to have even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with our alternative culture,
because they're going to be more receptive
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that it's important to be
introducing to mothers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pregnancy or even before they want to get
pregnant to start ingesting cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: doses, you know, that make them feel good,
which in turn is going to help their baby
[SPEAKER_00]: in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think when we see these
children who have had cannabinoids since
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning, you know, they are able to
receive the cannabinoids much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's very familiar to
their system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which allows their immune system to,
you know, avoid autoimmune disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an important key that,
you know, we haven't had enough research
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, but we are doing it,
like you said, you know, working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely am noticing that those
children that have had the THC and the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: from the very beginning are just doing so
much better with the medicine right off
[SPEAKER_00]: the get go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first dosage that they get it
because their body is reminded of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was kind of where that story
was leading to because of that experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like, well, maybe it is THC that
is benefiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: She got a little bit more comfortable
within slowly adding some milligrams of
[SPEAKER_03]: THC into the child's dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw the seizures dramatically
decrease, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot, you know, there's a lot
we don't know about neonatal impact and in
[SPEAKER_03]: utero impact of high level cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's people who might be
watching this get nervous and go,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh my gosh, are they advocating for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a big difference between
sitting around and taking dabs all day,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, and using certain cannabinoids as a
supplement in the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at the research of in
utero use with children, right,
[SPEAKER_03]: or parents who are using cannabis and the
children who then came through the
[SPEAKER_03]: pregnancy, when they remove comorbidity,
right, things like alcohol use and smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: and other factors, there's really nothing
that shows any harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's still, even with that,
that's not saying we're advocating or
[SPEAKER_03]: recommending parents abuse cannabis in
high levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we need to learn to
differentiate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more than one way we can use
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a night and day difference in
some of these supplements if the parents
[SPEAKER_03]: are having issues that are possibly more
beneficial and less harmful than say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, SSRI inhibitor, right,
some of those things that we know can
[SPEAKER_03]: cause problems in utero.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the mom says dealing with
depression, I wouldn't say jump and just
[SPEAKER_03]: start using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have the choices between some
of these drugs that we know can cause in
[SPEAKER_03]: utero problems, and a low dose cannabinoid
supplement that can deal with what might
[SPEAKER_03]: be causing a regulatory issue that can
cause some depression or some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things that can happen in pregnancy,
it's just about looking at what is safe
[SPEAKER_03]: and best for the mother and child.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're at the point now where if you
get over that fear that cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_03]: this evil, dangerous drug and there's
really no science to back it up and you
[SPEAKER_03]: compare it to what would be offered at the
pharmacy, it's just about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is the least impactful with the most
chance of a positive benefit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think cannabis falls way before a
lot of these other drugs that are given to
[SPEAKER_03]: women in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's important to note
that, you know, women are also utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in their pregnancy for,
you know, things that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an ailment that's going on with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're utilizing it as their
medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'd like to note, you know,
saying that I don't advocate in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you do in large doses,
and I certainly don't advocate for women
[SPEAKER_00]: to be smoking during their pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hot smoke cuts off the vaso
movement in the placental from the mother
[SPEAKER_00]: to the baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that if they are
utilizing cannabis, you know, smoking it
[SPEAKER_00]: in large doses, I don't recommend at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's unfortunate you have to
just mention that because that's what a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people visualize right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so they have to keep putting
that qualifier on there to realize that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's different types of relationships
that you can have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some can be very beneficial and safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to throw something out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Russo who presented the
idea of what he's calling cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiency syndromes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a plural.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea is that there's all these
conditions that we've found that humans
[SPEAKER_05]: are subject to that seem to respond to
cannabis therapies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of them are ingested cannabis,
again, where we see the really dramatic
[SPEAKER_05]: results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Russo, I believe it was Russo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember, Forrest?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Russo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome
is, yeah, Russo's baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabinoid deficiency syndrome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, what blew my mind about this was
the idea that all these conditions from
[SPEAKER_05]: epilepsy to autism to certain cancers,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_05]: all these things that respond to
cannabinoids are happening in the human
[SPEAKER_05]: population because the human population,
due to prohibition, is suffering from a
[SPEAKER_05]: collective cannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we start adding the cannabinoids to
our bodies, I think of CBD as the molecule
[SPEAKER_05]: that helps your body find the state that
we call health.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a homeostatic regulator.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps the body find the condition we
call health.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's adaptogenic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Among other things, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps the body find health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did an episode of my podcast with
Dr. Jeffrey Hergenrather, and he went into
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis as an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that conversation, we could do a whole
show on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really interested in talking more
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to do the show so I can learn
more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not ready to speak a bunch about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, really, really interesting
conversations and how it pertained to some
[SPEAKER_03]: of maybe the misunderstandings about
cannabis, about what cannabis does what,
[SPEAKER_03]: but without taking into account that
cannabis can do different things at
[SPEAKER_03]: different times because of the body's
ability to use it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really resonate with using polypores
and medicinal mushrooms in this equation,
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would love to see our community get
more involved in that and being able to
[SPEAKER_06]: take different compounds from medicinal
mushrooms and put its magic, which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect fusion to the human body as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other adaptogenic Chinese herbs that
really share different terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has as well as cannabinoids that
cannabis has as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to look at what other
sources that we can get it from so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a more holistic, more rounded view
of it as well as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an opportunity to bring all
modalities together and be able to bring
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis in with Chinese herbs and in
with the polypores that we get from our
[SPEAKER_06]: forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have amazing polypores in our
forest and we're finding incredible
[SPEAKER_06]: results by bringing it together with
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we read as much Japanese and Russian
stuff as possible, but PDF files are
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd work together with medical
industry as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I see mycelium running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just take a minute, Wade,
to just put you on your shirt there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite a fan of it so far this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're drinking mushrooms right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're drinking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I think that part of what we're
speaking to is that my experience of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis it is one of the healing plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's reasons that humans have
been interested in all these different
[SPEAKER_05]: herbs, mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm pretty convinced that science can
do a lot for us about helping to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand some of the modalities,
some of the things that happen to make
[SPEAKER_05]: nature what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also pretty confident that science
has a very limited view of the totality of
[SPEAKER_05]: things that are going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a wisdom in herbalism.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something going on with those
plants and how our bodies relate to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what we're doing here today in
the church is exploring how cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: one of those healing plants that we are
all drawn to very strongly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's other things going on
and really part of what I'm here for is a
[SPEAKER_05]: sense of wellbeing and happiness and
health that cannabis helps me experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I use other herbs as well,
as well as mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really view mushrooms as a really great
sign in the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: When mushrooms are happening in the
garden, everybody's happy in the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stamets is research on bees and the
benefits that they're finding for
[SPEAKER_05]: honeybees who are an essential friend in
all of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's really important,
too, when we start talking about blending
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants and looking for different
compounds and medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these ancient Chinese herbs that have
been studied forever that talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence and Ayurvedic Chinese herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know so much about it, but maybe
modern science hasn't stepped into the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, oh, we don't know
anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tremendous amount of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really interested in taking all of
that research of herbs and then feeding it
[SPEAKER_00]: to those master plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to create more terpenes with
terpenes, you know, going to those master
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that have been looked at forever
and ever and ever, collecting them from
[SPEAKER_00]: the woods in the forest and then feeding
them to themselves or creating different
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds, making teas out of those and
building the soil microbes, because the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil microbes are the actual true key to
the medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can talk all day about what we're going
to do with all of our secondary
[SPEAKER_06]: metabolites when we get them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, to be able to get the most
complex and intricate cannabinoid systems
[SPEAKER_06]: or terpene profiles starts with soil and a
diverse soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we can get into herbalism for teas
and herbalism for soils and herbalism for
[SPEAKER_06]: soil rhizosphere activity, then all of a
sudden everything's vibrating.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the soil's vibrating,
the medicine's vibrating, we're vibrating,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just like folklore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really comes out in the labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes out in people's reaction to
wanting to buy the medicine and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really full spectrum thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it makes them feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, medicine is something that
we can test in science, but medicine is
[SPEAKER_00]: also something that we can test when we
ingest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're giving the medicine
everything, the thing that we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: a full spectrum from other plants and
other medicinal plants, then we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: familiarizing our own immune system,
our own DNA with those medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, as far as our DNA goes and
our structure from the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been utilizing these plants,
you know, from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Respectful evolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a step back for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: In one of the things that I understand
about traditional Chinese medicine was the
[SPEAKER_05]: original agreement in a village between
the healer and the folk who lived in the
[SPEAKER_05]: village was that the people who wanted
this healer's help would offer whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: they had, some portion of it to them to
help them maintain a sense of health,
[SPEAKER_05]: well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as you were healthy,
you kept paying the healer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you got sick, they treated you at
no cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Western medicine, our medical system
today is set up that no one gets paid
[SPEAKER_05]: until somebody's sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a problem there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in the interest of our medical
system, if you will, to show us and teach
[SPEAKER_05]: us how to maintain health.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the traditional Chinese
culture, it was about maintaining health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these herbs that they, I've had good
experience with acupuncture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting way off subject here, but I'm
really talking about health at the moment
[SPEAKER_05]: and the sense of well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really think that science is helping
us to understand why we don't feel
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think science has the full
answer on how to get healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think nature, we evolved with nature and
all these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that is where we can find
well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is in nature and how nature can work
together with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it involves finding all of these
things that we're speaking of.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the sense of health,
the sense of well-being, of being in your
[SPEAKER_05]: body and feeling good in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I call it happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everyone wants.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I call it happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: People go looking for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They look for it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just can't find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, where the hell is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: They catch little glimpses of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, I was feeling it for a few
seconds there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you notice?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happiness is health.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's balance.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's well-roundedness.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a lot more than using
cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see a lot of people in the industry who
just need to get a healthier diet,
[SPEAKER_09]: be a little more active, exercise.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because cannabis is one part of the puzzle
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think it will bring happiness
alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, happiness is the proper balance of
those chemical soup that your body is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this depression versus manic joy is
all which neurotransmitters flowing on
[SPEAKER_03]: what level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny that when we look at tying
in cannabis to this, when we look at ways
[SPEAKER_03]: to influence your endocannabinoid system,
whose sole job is to keep the body in
[SPEAKER_03]: balance, in homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_03]: To provide that optimal setup for your
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best ways to influence that system
that have nothing to do with cannabis are
[SPEAKER_03]: diet and exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're exercising, when your diet is
good, you influence the way your
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, when you are doing those things,
and we've known that for years and years
[SPEAKER_03]: and years, what we didn't know is how much
that effort was really benefiting the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system and supporting its
ability to keep the body healthy and in
[SPEAKER_03]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard coming in on the mute thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that exercise is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also healthy microbes,
happy microbes, happy beneficial bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of our body makes us happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when we are doing healthy
things for ourselves and we're treating
[SPEAKER_00]: our soils with good things, then we're
getting healthy microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they have the higher
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way more of them than there is us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if we are able to ally
with them in a way that is more open to
[SPEAKER_00]: our culture, we're just starting to get
into bifidus and lactobacillus and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: prebiotics and the probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's starting to become sort of a
regular term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it on TV in just regular
commercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we can start gaining more and
more intelligence from those microbes as a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture to help us out and along the way
to create a higher intelligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like you have to oxygenate your teas,
you have to oxygenate your blood and
[SPEAKER_06]: oxygenate through cardiovascular movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of why gardening is health is
because you're ingesting soil microbes in
[SPEAKER_06]: your fingers and you're utilizing your
body.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're stretching.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing like garden yoga and you're
getting weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to oxygenate your soils too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have aeration in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more and more research is being done
on a medical scientific study that people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are having a lot of ailments,
autoimmune disorders, seizures,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are having IBS, people that
are even having cancer, all they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: is looking into the microbiome inside of
the intestine and realizing that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: totally devoid of a lot of different
microbiology that they should have in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is sort of all
wrapped up into one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no cannabinoid system microbiome.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You said there's more of them than us,
but I guess when it comes to bacteria,
[SPEAKER_09]: they are us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you draw that line?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good conversations today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We busted out some pretty deep stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mitochondria is the whole other
aspect that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole mitochondrial DNA has its
own DNA that surrounds all of ourselves as
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole other entity with inside of our
body.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just so unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's totally living being as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's digesting and thinking and
breathing for us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really interesting wormhole
that we can go down for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a healthy immune system creates
a healthy immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why cannabis is a great
catalyst in our thinking towards that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are thinking about it when
we're utilizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have to go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, Marcus, it's not just
utilizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But cannabis gives us the mindset to sit
back and connect and think about all these
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing things and then go out and put it
to use and practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then having this community to share it
with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we can't all do everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once we have it all to share with,
then I think that we have the most amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: And recently, in the last few years,
there have been some pretty things that
[SPEAKER_06]: have happened within growing and
cultivating and also within medicine and
[SPEAKER_06]: all the extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like never ending,
really fun things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like exciting to wake up every
day to find out what new thing we get to
[SPEAKER_06]: learn about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I can only imagine 20 years
from now.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we'll know about these relationships,
these compounds and how they interact with
[SPEAKER_09]: not just sick people, but healthy people,
people, you know, as preventative,
[SPEAKER_09]: the whole it's really going to there's
going to be this eventual.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're such humans.
[SPEAKER_09]: We always we just divide, divide,
divide.
[SPEAKER_09]: We divide everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We cut it all up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We categorize it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then eventually we come around.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems that for me, what I'm coming
around to is the quiver, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: for earlier having the conversation about
the difference between oil and hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was by no means saying that one is
better than the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, I have a preference, but there's
always going to be different preferences
[SPEAKER_09]: for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why monomolecular medicine will
have its place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why, you know, FICO will have
its place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why all the different types of
extracts, ones that we don't even know
[SPEAKER_09]: about right now, will have their place
because it's unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it changes small things.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we leave that footprint behind,
when we change those volatile terpenes
[SPEAKER_09]: that we know modulate the effects of the
cannabinoids, then we know that by
[SPEAKER_09]: changing the way we make the medicine,
we're changing the medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So speaking of volatile terpenes,
Forrest, how do you decarboxylate but
[SPEAKER_07]: still maintain your terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that seems to be a trick in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are removing terpenes and
reincorporating after any kind of thermal
[SPEAKER_07]: treatment whatsoever, because the most
delicate of terpenes, which is the most
[SPEAKER_07]: delicate part of the fragrance,
will thermally rearrange or decompose and
[SPEAKER_07]: give you off flavors from what you've
extracted.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are there any secrets on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I've got nothing really fancy
to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we are hometown sort of folks,
but we definitely don't just decarboxylate
[SPEAKER_03]: in an oven and let everything get lost
onto the wall, so your oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we keep everything contained when we're
decarboxylating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we're doing our ethanol rinses,
we rinse the containers that we
[SPEAKER_03]: decarboxylate in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually see them build up on the
surface of those things to integrate them
[SPEAKER_03]: back into the medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds kind of country doing it,
but through test results and through
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, we've seen it makes a real
difference that you can actually capture
[SPEAKER_03]: those terpenes in the decarboxylation
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we rinse the containers and bags
with the alcohol to strip any terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: that have collected during that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, they just are all on the
outside of your oven wall or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, whatever you're decarving it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you recover your ethanol?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then how many times do you use it
before you don't use it anymore or you
[SPEAKER_07]: keep on using it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it definitely loses something,
as you know, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we do is we kind of reconstitute
it by adding in fresh as you go,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a cycle that goes through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows it to stay pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're losing enough in the soak
and the rinse where you're not getting all
[SPEAKER_03]: of your alcohol back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're constantly having to add fresh
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're constantly adding fresh alcohol
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say we reclaim 80%, then the next batch
has 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is fresh and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it that's extracted that fouls the
ethanol, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not a terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sugar or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what makes the ethanol no good anymore?
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point, is it actually worth it
to actually just buy a still and distill
[SPEAKER_07]: that ethanol to recover?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because ethanol could be damn expensive
because it's a controlled dangerous
[SPEAKER_07]: substance.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to have a license for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people have to get paid to
even this bioethanol is a pain in the ass
[SPEAKER_07]: to supply chain people that have their
pockets open that want to make a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: money here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the question that I'm asking you is
that, so when you recover your ethanol,
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll use it like maybe once,
twice, or how many times can you use it to
[SPEAKER_07]: where it no longer has good extraction?
[SPEAKER_07]: We use organic alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get it 200 proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to drive a long way to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess we're not throwing it out
because we're constantly making batches
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's just recycled through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not seeing that loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when we don't constantly add fresh in
every single time that it goes bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish I had the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to plead ignorance there as to why
it goes bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wrap my brain around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping maybe you guys could let me
know as to what changes because it's still
[SPEAKER_03]: high octane alcohol and ethanol when it
comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just we've all experienced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it doesn't work and pull the
same after a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we don't have that problem much
because we constantly add fresh ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not necessarily dumping any out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we lose in the wash and in the soak
is enough volume is when we replace it
[SPEAKER_03]: with clean, fresh alcohol every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we don't have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: You said you'd lost about 20% each run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I'm generalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my medicine makers might be watching
this going for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your numbers all wrong and shaking
their heads with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But simplifying, we lose 10%, 20% each
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we reconstitute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very material dependent in general,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's how dry it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge step as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do a whole episode on our med
making process, which I'd be happy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times when people are
distilling or making, doing ethanol
[SPEAKER_03]: washes, they don't dry out the material
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's got to be to the point where
you think it's ruined, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You would never do it for cannabis that
you were smoking, like crumbling in your
[SPEAKER_03]: hands dry because it's the water that is
going to cause problems in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you do that, it's also going to
then absorb a lot of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we lose the majority of
our alcohol is in that step.
[SPEAKER_12]: We always use the desiccator with the
cannabis before we put it in with the
[SPEAKER_12]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, you could freeze dry
that some product and you'd be surprised
[SPEAKER_09]: how it turned out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's all quite interesting,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Different ways to make medicine or to
acquire medicine that's already there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not making anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just sort of, well, I look at it as
the same as, you know, we can grow
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and we can all grow the same
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be a certain
petition, certain amount of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: ruin it during the curing and drying
process, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, how do we, you know,
how do we just get the best, the best
[SPEAKER_03]: process we can, we can, we're all going to
end up with something at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just like everything, how can we help
the plant maintain its full potential?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you don't see it very often,
at least I don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do see a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some yesterday that I felt like,
wow, this is some of the first cannabis in
[SPEAKER_09]: a while that has expressed itself to its
maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just really covered in this
beautiful, beautiful coating of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It smelled impeccable.
[SPEAKER_09]: It felt like velour and it was just nice
to see someone grow bud that is actually
[SPEAKER_09]: attuned to the infamous local BC brokerage
term quads.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's selling mid-grade schwag as
quads.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are using and throwing around words
that aren't accurate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like to be a bit of a stickler.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I apologize if I come across as a dick
because I do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all I was doing with saying that hash
and oil are different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise they wouldn't have different
names.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they're different processes.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're different products.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Words matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are quads?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yabba Gabba.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is the way it happened in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was involved in the game,
it didn't go as high.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't go hot as high as quads.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was triples and it was triples were
triple A's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Triple A being the highest quality that
you could get and triple A being
[SPEAKER_09]: ridiculous quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the trips.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want the trips.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then buddy brings you a 50 pack of
mushrooms and you're like, no,
[SPEAKER_09]: dude, like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take the mushrooms, but it's the herb
I wanted.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always been a firm supporter of the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_09]: The same way cannabis helped me change the
way I think and look at things
[SPEAKER_09]: differently.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got an incredible amount of value from
psychedelic mushrooms and I wasn't really
[SPEAKER_09]: like eat a bunch and go to fish shows.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I did enough of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was more like go and with like one or
two people and really like go into the
[SPEAKER_09]: trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Learned an incredible amount about myself
and about kind of the world and the way it
[SPEAKER_09]: works just through these experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would never, I would never downplay
psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely feel that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you see people now taking what are
they taking it for?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it low doses for PTSD and some other
elements?
[SPEAKER_09]: Depression.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maps.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have incredible work on all kinds of
different medicinal systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had, I mean, you receive amazing
teachings through, through psychedelics
[SPEAKER_06]: and through journeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they're journeys.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can also have like the worst
experience ever, depending on your
[SPEAKER_09]: setting.
[SPEAKER_09]: The people you're doing with it and your
intentions, but I always had, I was like
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Hicks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I hate to tell you,
I had a lot of fun on drugs, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: where he does that little sort of,
I had a great time on psychedelic
[SPEAKER_09]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think of them as definitely,
you know, as important as the,
[SPEAKER_09]: as the, my views on cannabis are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a strong feeling that psychedelic
mushrooms will and not just psychedelic
[SPEAKER_09]: mushrooms, but mushrooms as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: As a whole will come to offer,
you know, more than we could have ever
[SPEAKER_09]: possibly imagined.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though Paul Stammons is really
blowing the lid off this shit right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone wants to go and watch a Paul
Stammons video, this particular one,
[SPEAKER_09]: how mushrooms can save the world that this
book is based on, which I think originally
[SPEAKER_09]: was one of his Ted talks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was like, I think it was called six
ways mushrooms can save the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely standing ovation type shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to have Paul on hash church.
[SPEAKER_09]: One day it would be amazing if anyone knew
how to reach out to Paul.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could reach out to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He definitely would.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, his time is of the essence at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So his work is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He loves, you know, uh, cannabis and the
psychoactive he's totally, that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful thing about Paul.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've spent days with him and I've
even done the Cortez workshop with him at
[SPEAKER_00]: Holly hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of fun, really fun times at
the Oregon country fair late night.
[SPEAKER_00]: See me in the early mornings.
[SPEAKER_06]: That book is, that book is an accumulation
of all of this work and everything that
[SPEAKER_06]: he's been doing along with his crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's, it's Paul Stammons,
but it's his crew and everyone that works
[SPEAKER_06]: in fungi perspective for perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Olympia and his wife, his wife,
his partner, and they're all just on a
[SPEAKER_06]: high level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really amazing what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a good one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I, uh, I got to sort of play a little
trick on Paul at one of the psychedelic,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, uh, symposiums that were up in
Whistler, very small gatherings,
[SPEAKER_09]: the psychedelic family, much smaller than
the cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he walked by my booth and I had a
picture of a tricone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, uh, I think it was from Youp Dumas,
the Dutch photographer that used the micro
[SPEAKER_09]: electrons, uh, Mike Scrop microscopy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, he had this incredible still to
this day, one of the greatest tricone
[SPEAKER_09]: shots ever taken.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I showed it to Paul and I said,
can you identify this mushroom?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just stopped him in his tracks.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like looking at it all intently.
[SPEAKER_09]: And after about a minute, I said,
ah, you know, it's, it's a, it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: tricone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a glandular tricone from a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was just like, man, you had me
stumped.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're never going to figure this one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of mushroom is, oh my God,
it's translucent mushroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's happening here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does it look like it's lit up?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, oh yeah, it's a, it looks so big
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a full page picture of a full,
you couldn't really tell it was small.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was probably thinking it was like,
you know, much bigger than it was.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should have photoshopped it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it looked like it was bruised and blue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been it right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I found these on my property.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're about the size of ants.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you eat them, the entire world just
splits open and light.
[SPEAKER_09]: Casts shadow that creates a language that
you learn instantaneously upon seeing,
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey Tony, we're going deep.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on, dude?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also, I was just saying to invite
anyone that knew Paul Stamets to invite
[SPEAKER_09]: him into hash church.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause man, wouldn't we love to have that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, our friends at Dragonfly Madison
were like, we know Paul.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll invite him.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are things with you, Tony?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just been, uh, pulling some all
nighters, trying to figure out all kinds
[SPEAKER_08]: of little technical things, but I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: It is today, my son's third birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, and the only reason I'm really not
kind of not doing hash church is because
[SPEAKER_09]: he's sick right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's just sleeping.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not feeling good.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got a fever and he's just been sick
for like three days.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just hate when kids get sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's no good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually it means you'll get sick soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, you know what, as a parent,
it's like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'll take the, I would take his
sickness in the blink of an eye times 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but, uh, it's how they build immune
systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just, uh, just hope that they're on
the right path and that the fever is doing
[SPEAKER_09]: the good work instead of the bad work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can tell you, uh, I made a post
about this earlier in the week.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's something there actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that post.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should say it's CBN and CBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, but mostly CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the one you saw the, uh,
color changing happening with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, it goes clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's pretty clear just in that
giant jar.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked yellow, but, um, my first
experience, I was going to load a pen,
[SPEAKER_08]: but my first experience was on Friday
night.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I'm going to make some,
some claims here about CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I don't think we've had a lot of
experience vaporizing full concentrates of
[SPEAKER_08]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but had a couple of people try it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, interesting enough, I think that,
you know, that kind of, uh, forgetfulness,
[SPEAKER_08]: spacey head kind of feeling that you get
when you smoke a joint or you smoke some
[SPEAKER_08]: older herb, that kind of couch lock
feeling that you, you kind of get,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, we all kind of think of like CBN,
but the spacing, as like when you hit it,
[SPEAKER_08]: it like, um, it kind of, I could see why I
would help.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see why I went to sleep and slept
so well on Friday night, but it kind of,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of makes you forget about what
you're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, I wonder if that's CBN
or a lack of pining.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I mixed this with Clementine terpenes
just to give it some kind of modulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: In effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it could play an effect, but I mean,
it was like this, uh, I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and it kind of like, I wouldn't say
the forgetfulness comes from it,
[SPEAKER_08]: but like when you kind of, you almost like
lost for words a little bit, you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of like, Oh, it's kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little spacey.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're like, you know,
maybe you can't pronounce words or like
[SPEAKER_08]: anything right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I wouldn't say it's quite that
drastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's, it's like, uh, my mind was wound
up and I was talking a whole bunch and I
[SPEAKER_08]: hit that it definitely silences you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're like, I remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you were talking to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking to you like a million miles
an hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you were like, you were like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't, and I was like, Oh,
that's strange.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had, and I, maybe it was the Delta
eight or the CVC, but there was this like
[SPEAKER_08]: delayed effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just kind of like, okay,
kind of calm me down.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I started to yawn and I got tired
and then I slept for 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for sure it helps with sleeping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of helps with sleeping.
It kind of helps with sleeping.
[SPEAKER_08]: It calms your mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could see like for PTSD and for
different things, it helps you forget.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no, that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think you got, and how did you feel
the next morning?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I didn't feel anything in the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear anything the next morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I got to smoke some right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, uh, not going to help, but,
uh, I'm going to just woke up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see, but it's, uh, definitely
unusual.
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely think it could go in a pen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, with Clementine terpenes or any other
terpenes paired with it, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't taste like cherry at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no cherry taste to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no, uh, it's very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, it doesn't have like your
normal, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have any kind of cherry tastes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't, and it's absolutely clean on
the nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's, I'll show it to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll show it to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's clean on the nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clean, clean money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's show you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Napa Valley's like Tony's going to fall
asleep on stream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at, look at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you see this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just 30 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is making me tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like nerd porn for, you know,
cannabis science junkies right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it was testing like close to 50% CBN
and like, Oh, it's quite a bit of CBC in
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to look at that again.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no THC or THC in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the other 50%?
[SPEAKER_09]: The other 50% is roundup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Roundup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's roundup CBN, new bubble man pen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how much vapor I get.
[SPEAKER_08]: No cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: And normally I cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys all know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know CBN doesn't work that way
because it's a byproduct of THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's the rest of the components or
they, they activated in their acidic form
[SPEAKER_03]: with as clear as it is, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think I posted the test result on
the capsule.
[SPEAKER_08]: The capsule kind of shows you when,
uh, but that has CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll post the regular one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so the thing with it and Mark would
probably like, like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you take, and the first time
they started testing and if you take like
[SPEAKER_08]: the pure CBN extract and take like,
you know, a concentrate of it,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's off the GC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like off the scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, diluting it four times
before you test it, uh, gives you a much
[SPEAKER_08]: more accurate reading.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really sure what the rest of it is
Mark, cause it's as clear as can be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you could see it on the side,
how thick it is, but, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like, this was, uh, uh,
molecularly distilled.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So something that's distilled,
I mean, if, um, if it, uh, it's about 50%
[SPEAKER_07]: one thing and 50% something else,
I mean, typically a distillation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 90, it was 90%.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't 90% THC with only THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it was not, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So say, say that again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you said it was 50%.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do this with rosin or
distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you did it with rosin, right,
and you made it, and we've done this with,
[SPEAKER_08]: we've made a distillation from rosin,
which you'll lose about 30% of your weight
[SPEAKER_08]: in terpenes and fats and other bullshit
from the hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could get to like a 90% activated THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do that also from distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you molecularly, uh, distilling and
you, if you start with a 85 or 90% THC,
[SPEAKER_08]: you could also start with THCA,
which is something I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys talked about today, but I definitely
wanted to put the instructions up and get
[SPEAKER_08]: people on the THCA tip of how to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you could start with a couple of
different things, but ultimately if you
[SPEAKER_08]: start with THCA, you got to convert it to
THC and that's pretty easy to do in a
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could, you could, uh, take a hash
rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could double boil that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can gently and slowly activate it from
THC to THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you could make a distillation from it
if you had enough of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you get to 90% though, and you've
cleaned up what's supposed to be any of
[SPEAKER_08]: the, you know, contaminants and stuff left
behind, then the process that we do,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, not necessarily mine to share with,
but, um, it does, it then does not use
[SPEAKER_08]: your traditional, uh, heat and,
uh, distillation methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: It uses a completely different method,
uh, when, which does not lose any weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would go from 90.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if something, you start with a kilo of
90%, uh, THC, you end up with 980,
[SPEAKER_08]: 950 grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very little is lost in the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if any, and it goes, it's a more,
a little bit more than a 50% conversion
[SPEAKER_08]: without a volume.
[SPEAKER_08]: Volume loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty, pretty substantially crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I didn't really believe it until.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's a 50% conversion, that means
you still have 50% THC?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if it's a 50% conversion,
only 50% of it is converting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go from 90% and we ended up around 48
to 50% CBN with no THC present left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it just, all right, Mark,
well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just the breakdown of the molecule
itself?
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand those numbers don't add up to
me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, no, that's really simple.
[SPEAKER_12]: It means that there was a hundred percent
conversion, but the yield was only 50%.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will tell you this, uh, there are,
okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you start with a kilo that's testing
86% or 860 milligrams and you end up with
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 milligrams of CBN, it appears that the
CBC was a, I don't know if it was a
[SPEAKER_08]: converted by-product, but there was high
levels of CBC that were not there before.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't make any sense at all to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't make any sense because you
need, you, you need a synthase to convert,
[SPEAKER_07]: to convert CBC into either CBD or,
or THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's that requires, there's
electrons required there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're, there's chemistry going on
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't have CBC in there if there
wasn't to begin with.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: We, we did a lot of work on CBC varieties
and develop varieties that were the
[SPEAKER_12]: majority of the cannabinoids in the plant
were CBC.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me look at, let me see if CBC was in
the original starting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took a picture of the test score.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be, might be talking out my ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony, is this the same process where you
saw the color changing effects based on
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the same?
[SPEAKER_08]: This has nothing to do with the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the post said it was due to the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was changing colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you just take the, if you just take
that oil at the end and warm it up,
[SPEAKER_08]: it goes clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I thought what you were doing is you
were starting with the THC isolate and you
[SPEAKER_07]: were converting it to CBN to make a
something that's 50% by weight CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that's what you said you were
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, this is a, imagine you start
with like 1200 grams of hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You end up with a thousand grams of rosin
distillate just without alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just, you fractionate in and then this
is high THC, a high THC variety.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean the rosin is like 80% as it is and
you get it to 90%.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you remove all the terpenes and all
the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, let me see if I can find this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the same way, it doesn't change
weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just converts all of that THC to,
from a 90% to 46% CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's 56% of nothing showing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two different, there are two
different molecules with two different
[SPEAKER_07]: molecular ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so to go from THC to CBN, you
basically have to move, lose two moles of
[SPEAKER_07]: hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's in a dehydrogenation process to
aromatize the North ring of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're looking at the chicken wire,
North ring will now look like a benzene
[SPEAKER_07]: ring because it'll now be fully
unsaturated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that process, you have to lose two
moles of H2.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's different in molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just like, THCA and THC are
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you're extracting in the rosin
process is first like THCA, then that's
[SPEAKER_07]: carboxylated to make THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that undergoes this dehydrogenation
reaction to make CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems like you just have a
distribution of all either cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_07]: acids that have been decarboxylated and
now partially converted over to CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that partial conversion,
there could also be what's called dihydro.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have what I make when I hydrogenate,
which is hexahydro.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hexahydro, no double bond at all
naturally in the plant tetrahydro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there's dihydro, which is with two
double bonds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's thermodynamically downhill
to lose that last mole of hydrogen to make
[SPEAKER_07]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you'll have everything populated
along that profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably depends on if they're using
some type of co-oxidant or what type of
[SPEAKER_07]: oxidation procedure they're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: No oxygen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So no heat or oxygen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the only thing I could tell you
is that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you need something to overcome the
activation energy barrier between there
[SPEAKER_07]: and there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I said, it's not really my
process to share.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was co-developed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all I can tell you is that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like it needs improvement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I don't think so at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if it's only a 50% yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's how I was currently doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking sift, farmer's grade sift,
and putting it into a chamber that has
[SPEAKER_08]: heat and oxygen for degradation for a week
at a time to convert from 250 milligrams
[SPEAKER_08]: of let's say THC A, right, in its sift
form, down to 70 milligrams of CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I started with a kilo of sift,
I end up losing the weight of the keif
[SPEAKER_08]: that isn't 1,000 grams when I get it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 500, 600 grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also lost the, maybe not quite that
much, but I'm losing 70 plus percent in
[SPEAKER_08]: the conversion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing it that way with heat and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm saying to you now is when I have
a kilo of rosin or distillate,
[SPEAKER_08]: I get the same kilo back and the
conversion rate is extremely well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy with the 50% conversion rate and
no weight loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but this is where I'm having a
difficult time following you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're only getting 50% conversion,
that means in your story, have you thought
[SPEAKER_08]: of any way to convert it at a better rate
from THC to CBN?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not trying to make CBN,
but I'm just trying to understand what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're holding up in the jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if what you're saying is that you're
only getting 50% conversion, does that
[SPEAKER_07]: mean the other 50% that's not converting,
does that stay as THC?
[SPEAKER_07]: You say that there's no THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the other 50%?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, no, I'm with you because the
other, and the labs also have kind of a
[SPEAKER_08]: hard time testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've tested this like four different
ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I can tell you is when we mixed
everything and we said, okay, here's our
[SPEAKER_08]: final capsule with CBD oil in it too,
the only thing in it was CBD, CBN,
[SPEAKER_08]: Delta-8, and CBC in the original oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I could find it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see, hold on, I'm gonna find it
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you exactly what was in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they look for Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they looked for Delta-8,
hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, this is SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: This went through a lot of different
testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I wouldn't have put it out there
if it didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was this one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so as a chemist, again, if I have a
reaction, it was 50% completion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that reaction to go to 100%
completion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I mean in terms of the
opportunity to take what you do out here,
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out how to push it the rest of the
50%.
[SPEAKER_07]: But go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, okay, maybe I'm saying it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: It converts all of the THC to CBN,
but the rate at which it converts it is
[SPEAKER_08]: about 50% of what it started with.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me read you what was in the
starting oil, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it's not changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it's changing into something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but rate, when you say the rate,
rate is a measure of how fast the reaction
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think what, Tony, correct me if I'm
wrong here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have essentially the same volume at
the end, but instead of a 90%
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration the THC was, all the THC's
gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the same volume, but you have a
50% concentration in the CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's the other stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Bro, I would love to know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I'm asking you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me tell you what was in it and try
to figure it out because it is mind
[SPEAKER_08]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been blown away for about two months
now working on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, okay, the starting oil,
this is all through SE Labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was tested twice, just to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's say the starting oil was 82%,
so it was an 82% THC, no delta eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was five, there was, okay,
so it was 82.46 THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was .57 THCV, 1.19 CBC, 1.43 CBG,
.57 CBN, .22 CBD, and .26 CBDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it came out, the only thing it had,
hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now when it came back out, it had no more
THC, no more THCA, no CBD, no CBDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had 400 plus, like 460 milligrams of
CBN, no CBDV, no CBDVA, no CBGA,
[SPEAKER_08]: no THCV.
[SPEAKER_08]: 42, 42 milligrams of delta eight and 77
milligrams of CBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's over 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of that was, it looks like 10% of it,
or 20% of it was CBC and 10% was delta
[SPEAKER_08]: eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I put that into a capsule to dilute
it to get it with CBD oil to try to make
[SPEAKER_08]: our P4.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, and that came out to,
that had, oh, that was the wrong one,
[SPEAKER_08]: hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one came out to, I got that one over
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that one came out to no THC,
no THCA, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our CBD that was in there was 44
milligrams, no CBDA.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it was 35 milligrams of CBN,
no other components except six milligrams
[SPEAKER_08]: of delta eight and 21 milligrams of CBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now a capsule's a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that lines up with exactly the oil
numbers of the CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that actually all does line up.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I'm saying to you is CBC was not
that much prevalent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps, I don't know where all the CBC
came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: If what you're saying is that when you
convert THC to CBN, like it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_08]: create CBC, is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it depends the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a, again, it sounds like a
proprietary low temperature process.
[SPEAKER_07]: No temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing chemistry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're taking the components and
you're rearranging the deck chairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know exactly, you have to look
at the chemistry and you look at the
[SPEAKER_07]: reaction manifolds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could CBC be formed?
[SPEAKER_07]: All the building blocks are there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you're just rearranging the
same atoms that are there in the
[SPEAKER_07]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there has to be sort of thermodynamic
driving force for those rearrangements.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't just happen on their own.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're either initiated by heat or light
or some type of microbial degradation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's all kinds of degraded in
cannabinoids that end up going CBN because
[SPEAKER_07]: CBN is somewhat of a thermodynamic dead
end.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think El Soli had pointed out that
there's hydroxylated metabolites.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the eight hydroxy THCs and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all, if you heat those up,
they immediately lose water, dehydrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it makes dihydro THC, which again,
goes to CBN almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, those are all thermodynamically
downhill from where the molecules in the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant are.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you start heating things or when
you treat them with catalysts or treat
[SPEAKER_07]: them with any type of stress to put stress
on those most sensitive molecules,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially ones that can equilibrate over
to other isomers, which is what CBC is,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: CBC is an isomers of THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know quite the answer to why
or how, I guess, but I'm pretty happy with
[SPEAKER_08]: the conversion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if there was a way, I guess what
you're saying, yeah, the next step would
[SPEAKER_08]: be if you can convert 86%, 800 and
something milligrams of THC to 800 and
[SPEAKER_08]: something milligrams of THC or CBN,
then yeah, that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think that's ever gonna be
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would think in a distillation that you
would get a cleaner cut or that you would
[SPEAKER_07]: actually, if you're doing a short path
distillation here, that you'd be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: take several cuts during that distillation
to look at like, can you actually get rid
[SPEAKER_07]: of the minor cannabinoid fractions there
in an earlier cut?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then later in a distillation,
major cut is gonna be just more purified
[SPEAKER_07]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBN is right, and Sam will correct me on
this, a white crystalline compound.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's pure, like CBD can be purified
to essentially be a white.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the scientists that I was working
with on this, I asked them about like
[SPEAKER_08]: breaking out CBN and they said,
yeah, you won't be able to do it with
[SPEAKER_08]: terpenes or anything because of the
polarity and the way that THCA or CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: breaks out is totally different than CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious to see like, cause that is the
next step.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, how do I take this to a next step?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like 99%?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's ways that you could
quantitatively convert THC that's been
[SPEAKER_07]: isolated like the clear, quantitatively
convert it all over to CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if it's not all converted,
you could then clean it up in
[SPEAKER_07]: chromatography or distillation to
basically make an analytically pure
[SPEAKER_07]: sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: But would you use a solvent in that
process?
[SPEAKER_07]: Depending on, you mean the dehydrogenation
of THC itself?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, would a solvent touch it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you probably have to do that in a
solvent or though you can be probably
[SPEAKER_07]: creative and figure out a way to do it
without using a solvent, but you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: that would require some engineering,
but yeah, most, so it's basically just a
[SPEAKER_07]: dehydrogenation reaction, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to- This is what you kind of
patented, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually patented the hydrogenation
that's adding hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydrogen in a way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the methyl cyclohexane ring of THC can
basically lose hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when you see, if you're doing a
distillation and you typically see white
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke coming from the distillation,
that's usually indicative of a CBN
[SPEAKER_07]: formation because what is happening is
that the oxygen in air is actually being
[SPEAKER_07]: hydrogenated, if you will, by the methyl
cyclohexane ring to make air or to make
[SPEAKER_07]: water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that steam that's actually coming
up from the distillation pot when you see
[SPEAKER_07]: the white smoke coming from your
distillation pot, that's typically
[SPEAKER_07]: indicative of CBN formation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it'll happen with just air.
[SPEAKER_07]: Air is actually, the oxygen in air is
strong enough, but you could use other
[SPEAKER_07]: oxidants to basically promote that to make
it go at less harsh conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Arno Haskamp published a paper
and I think did his PhD dissertation on a,
[SPEAKER_07]: or one of the parts of his PhD
dissertation involved the quantitative
[SPEAKER_07]: oxidation of THC to CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's Googleable and you
could find his dissertation on the
[SPEAKER_07]: internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually saw that once, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think, did he use like silver
nitrate?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a silver kind of
stoichiometric oxidant, which I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_07]: is what you really wanna do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think one of the things that people
always get hung up on, again, is that you
[SPEAKER_07]: can convert, well, this happens to a small
extent just on the nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're oxidizing THC in an atmosphere
of oxygen, you will get some conversion to
CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you see that actually as an
artifact sometimes in dirty GCs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, things happen where you could
actually see the dihydro product as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Ryan has shared that
chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from Arno's paper, if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those intermediates can be identified.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to mention that,
Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so these guys, you know,
they work for Genentech and some other
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty substantial companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: But ultimately, yeah, they were like,
yeah, if you built this custom,
[SPEAKER_08]: this column machine and spent like
$800,000, they could break out everything
[SPEAKER_08]: in its pharmaceutical grade level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do believe that there is a little
bit of solvent that's used in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess what it is is you hit a wall
and you say, okay, if you're happy with
[SPEAKER_08]: converting THC to CBN without a solvent,
this is probably the best we're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to take it to the next level
and buy all the crazy gear, you probably
[SPEAKER_08]: could do it at a much more efficient
conversion rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think what might be key is to be
able to remove the product in like a
[SPEAKER_07]: reactive distillation so it doesn't build
up over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think over time, they will
degrade.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that there's other- We did use
short path, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think you could probably- To get the
rosin out, there was some funky,
[SPEAKER_08]: weird shit that I don't even know if I
want to share, like what comes out of
[SPEAKER_08]: hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for sure, when you try to short path
rosin, some weird shit comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time you heat stuff up,
like if you're heating stuff up to do a
[SPEAKER_07]: high vacuum distillation, you should
definitely do what you can to make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's completely been de-winterized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this is the point of having fats
and waxes and something that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: heating up to these temperatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: These things don't distill.
[SPEAKER_07]: What they do is they degrade.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they degrade, they create those
off-burn rubber flavors that you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: want in your distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the best way to keep that stuff out
of your distillate is to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: what goes into the pot is as clean as you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are using activated carbon and
sieves and what they can to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: by the time you put any thermal history on
that material, that you've done what you
[SPEAKER_07]: can to remove things that aren't meant to
be heated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heat it up to that temperature because
those things are going to degrade and give
[SPEAKER_07]: your stuff a really off flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so one thing I would note,
and I agree with that, is that when you go
[SPEAKER_08]: from a hash rosin the way it is,
like the azoline and the different weird
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff we're pulling out, I actually had it
tested.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it tested for all kinds of funky
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had THC in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, like you said, it was like
rubbery, fishy, all these weird different
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of what I thought was terpenes,
like blue terpenes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it actually had all kinds of shit in
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of bad flavor goes a long
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a drop of some of that stuff and you
completely blow your entire run.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people, again, who will take those
low boiling fractions, completely
[SPEAKER_07]: disassemble their unit before taking the
high boiling turps because you don't even
[SPEAKER_07]: want to contaminate the path by which
you're going to collect your wonderful
[SPEAKER_07]: clean distillate with all that ass
smelling crap that comes over early.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I think really if you do your
distillate preparation appropriately,
[SPEAKER_07]: that fraction should actually be quite
flavorful and try to hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen blue, I've seen yellow,
purple, red, all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_07]: colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would tell you, so check it out,
so then everybody's been talking about the
[SPEAKER_08]: THC thing, separating THC with the rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's been a pretty big topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's been a pretty big topic on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people making a lot of claims
that they created it and what have you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you from my experience,
the first time I ever saw it was our
[SPEAKER_08]: friend Matt from Straight Concentrate in
2015 when I was in Ukiah and we had our
[SPEAKER_08]: hands on the first press.
[SPEAKER_08]: He pressed hash rosin and then we took
that, repressed it, refolded it,
[SPEAKER_08]: set it up right in the little 25 screen,
repressed that, out came super sappy oil
[SPEAKER_08]: and inside was- You're talking to Matt
Armstrong who's with Chris now,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He watches, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's still with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was something on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like he was starting a new
label.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know really what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: But either way, we've had our differences
in the past and I wrote on his Instagram,
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, listen, all I can tell you is
in my history, in my experience,
[SPEAKER_08]: the first person that I saw repress rosin
was him and we had a white funky
[SPEAKER_08]: substance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never would create a product or release
it, but it was always very interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We tested that chip before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tested some recent Huckleberry OG that
we did and surprisingly it was extremely
[SPEAKER_08]: high in THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a white little chip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't have a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a website out there that teaches
you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got NMR of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the absolutely pristine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's beautiful, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The signals on the NMR ring like there's
no tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just absolutely pristine,
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's solventless.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to lowtemp-plates.com,
there's a whole tutorial on actually how
[SPEAKER_08]: to make it and you could refine this two
or three times.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you press your rosin and repress it
again at like 130 to 140, you'll get that
[SPEAKER_08]: nice white.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do it again and you could start
pulling out like all kinds of like
[SPEAKER_08]: crystalline from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been doing that for, so you could
do that for like a Prana line or something
[SPEAKER_08]: like that for capsules, which works
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I've been soaking those in like
how we do the crystalline for CBD and for
[SPEAKER_08]: the stuff that we're doing with Gold Drop
and now I've been doing that same thing
[SPEAKER_08]: with THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna have a Girl Scout Cookies
crystalline grown from soaking in terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of like people that are taking
like an ethanol wash then a hexane wash
[SPEAKER_08]: like on a CBD and then they're getting it
to break out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm breaking it out with cannabis
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully next week I'll have
variations of a crystalline that I could
[SPEAKER_08]: test that will be grown from within that
solventless.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fast way to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also working on ways to, if you do
that with say CBD and THC oil,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's potential of separating the CBD
out from the THCA because if you have any
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD that's in your oil, so if you notice
when you make that THCA and those little
[SPEAKER_08]: chips that are left behind, all of the oil
and the sauces to the other side,
[SPEAKER_08]: that will contain CBD and other
components.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that it's a significant
movement in the solventless world and hats
[SPEAKER_08]: off to Matt.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was working on it for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a couple other people out there
claim that they created it, but- Working
[SPEAKER_09]: on what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he squished, he pressed dry,
he pressed it again and inside the bag was
[SPEAKER_09]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we didn't know it at the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I mean, I did the same thing at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember my dry sift turning white,
being like, I gotta puff this and see
[SPEAKER_09]: what's up and feeling effects from it and
being like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought some to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought some to you recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember I was like, oh, check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we smoked it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Matt gave it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Matt gave me.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I found like, cause I've seen him
enter and we've talked after cups and
[SPEAKER_08]: different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's the patent?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I think he actually filed for it
or something, but he had, when I say he's
[SPEAKER_08]: been working, I think legally he was
working on patenting it if I wasn't
[SPEAKER_08]: mistaken, but- Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless, he had entered it a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd only seen him, this is like for a year
he's had it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I felt bad because it's really strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people weren't gravitating towards it
at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cups, it didn't do very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: People probably thought it was,
wasn't real.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even when I got it, I was like,
oh, this is solventless.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I remembered, like it just
triggered my memory.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember now, now it, cause we thought
it was lipids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought it was like fats or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what everyone was saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, that stuff's garbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have since though.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's interesting though, ever since I
started Prana when we pressed like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, CBD, or we pressed hash,
we keep all those chips.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that goes into the topical line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I even told that to, I've even said that
to Forrest when he came by and he was
[SPEAKER_08]: like, oh, and I was like, yeah,
everything gets reused.
[SPEAKER_08]: For us, you know, we put it under our high
vacuum and into our Prana fat and then
[SPEAKER_08]: use, and then heat it up to try to get
like an active THC out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's quite a bit, quite a bit in
those chips with talking trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of joke about it with,
with flower rosin and things and hash
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of edible makers that,
you know, it's gold.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's considered like gold now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people have been using that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of funny that like,
at least for the solventless world,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's, it's definitely the next,
it's definitely the next push in the next
[SPEAKER_08]: movement that will come out more and more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something that you could do with
a hair iron and a 25 street, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Making your rosin and making, making
another product simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's cool is the sauce.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, you know, like for us,
we walk into the walk-in freezer and then
[SPEAKER_08]: like 30 seconds, you can take it right
off.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if you're at home and it's,
you know, you've separated it,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to get like a super saucy
thing on your parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can fold that up, put it in a
double zip lock, throw it in a freezer,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, or vacuum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seal it and throw it in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to get it as cold as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the second you come out, if you're in
an 85 degree or 90 degree area,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just going to be all over the
parchment again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's the only difficult part.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think that, you know,
I do think it's going to push the,
[SPEAKER_08]: push the industry yet again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always like when people are doing things
without solvents to see where,
[SPEAKER_08]: see where it could go.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been D420K's moment to say
bong rip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like Tony was talking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I lucked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: He just had a pipe in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, you got to admit it's pretty
neat, huh, Mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as a chemist, you do everything
you can to try to find ways to separate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people were laughing and people have
been laughing about rosin for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there's all kinds of memes out
there that if you smoke rosin,
[SPEAKER_08]: you turn gay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of funny little memes
out there, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: FYI, you can take the highly educated
stems and put it on that Gen 1 cap of
[SPEAKER_02]: the...
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a little longer without burning
yourself because I'm sure it's going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: a little woo-woo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been looking for that thing for a
while, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time someone says that, I'm like,
yeah, where the hell is that thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually lost my little titanium grade
260 wire screen with a hole in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Gen 2 HE with, it has the hollow
and it has the two holes that allow you to
[SPEAKER_02]: breathe through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it allows you to actually breathe
through the cap, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's called the Gen 2?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it is the second generation
of the screws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, look at you.
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing screws off.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little tricks I've learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, dude, you still have to come by.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have your strawberry banana... No
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come by early this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: My birthday's tomorrow, so it's been kind
of a crazy week.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Longer up to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm taking one right now for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess I might as well join you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you, 40?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I wish.
[SPEAKER_08]: 48.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're 48.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't look 48.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I credit cannabis to not drinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have a single wrinkle on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lucky, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I blame the jeans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: People say that to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what I say?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, well, I don't have any... You
know, I got the good jeans from the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis or whatever from smoking,
but, you know, good complexion here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we both have the same situation up
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So... Well, I would have hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would have it around a band.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just how my family is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just shave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to look like some crazy nutty
professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not Rick from Rick and Morty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wub-a-lub-a-dub-dub.
Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wub-a-dub-a-dub-dub.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, if we're testing... So Mark,
we're testing the strawberry banana goo.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's testing 84 and 85%.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over 80 on the THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have 100 grams of this hash rosin
from strawberry banana goo that I'm going
[SPEAKER_08]: to press just to make the THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to like have that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'm going to re-silk it back in
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to grow that out and then add the
sauce back to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: See if I can make something crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something for bubble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little crazy something something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Franken hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there was a lot of questions about
like I got this week, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess those Trinity pens went out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did want to say that they're working
on a way to get terpenes back out to you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys on a retail level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll find out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like maybe not through Blue
River, but through Uptech, you'll be able
[SPEAKER_08]: to get those kits and you'll be able to
get terpenes as well from him because,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, he has a long history with his
credit card process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we went through the qualification
process and it seems like they were pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: accepted of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be pretty pretty good to get
those out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I sent you the new vials too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw those, huh, Mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they look pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always down with new vials.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it's important because look,
I've gone through this thing, these little
[SPEAKER_08]: applicators, and this is why I haven't
released stuff because I want to take time
[SPEAKER_08]: with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these little applicators, you could
see this had to be changed, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can either do an HD or LD or a
PTFE type of plastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight glass works too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight glass works really well.
[SPEAKER_09]: This straight glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are those I would say, you know,
Gary's working on trying to get those the
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, he's got one too over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So see the one that Mark's got?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that rubber at over, so that little
rubber stopper, anything past,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, 8% terpenes is going to start
to, 8 to 10% terpenes is going to start to
[SPEAKER_08]: eat that away long term.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you start getting 15% terpenes,
and I'm just sharing with it, like this
[SPEAKER_08]: little plunger wants to punch out whether
the terpenes are off gassing or whatever
[SPEAKER_08]: you want to call it, it definitely creates
a little bit of pressure in there from
[SPEAKER_08]: high volume of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about 70% THCA and 15%,
12% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's, they're okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: They work all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that at the end of the day,
I have a different method that I think,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, eventually we have to build our
own to be honest with you from scratch.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the meantime, we've got a different
way that I'm going to do it with a micro
[SPEAKER_08]: glass dropper and a vial within a vial
that I think is pretty neat and it has a
[SPEAKER_08]: PTFE cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the way that the vial will work,
I'll show you right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark will recognize these.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that little vial is on a kind of like
almost like a spring loaded into the cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you open it, you could actually have
your terpenes in there with a little glass
[SPEAKER_08]: dropper or a glass syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you could turn that inside to the
vial, mix all of your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could put two grams in there,
which makes four refill carts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is for the people at home that are
buying Trinity's that want to like make
[SPEAKER_08]: their own stuff at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need terpenes to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you need to be able to get it so that
you can get every last drop out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of it being a square bottom,
it needs to be a pointed bottom.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to be able to get something in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the solution for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then premixed refills.
[SPEAKER_08]: I find this thing to be easy to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Mark does.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're awesome because you could
do anything with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it easy to fill the tank up like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a little glass dropper that will go
into there and to put it inside of the
[SPEAKER_08]: tank would work as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that saucy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like a distillate, so it doesn't
necessarily have to be in something like
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, do you see it turning dark on
exposure to light?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when it first goes in there,
it's kind of like a lighter yellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's creamy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, it was lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was creamier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see the oil turning dark in those
clear glasses.
[SPEAKER_12]: Terpenes will also, besides melting the
rubber stopper and the syringe,
[SPEAKER_12]: will melt any plastic sidewalls also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't necessarily melt it,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically just plasticizes it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It melted.
[SPEAKER_12]: I first saw this 40 years ago in a sealed
vacuum sealed glass mason jar with a
[SPEAKER_12]: rubber band I accidentally left in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I opened it up six months later and the
rubber band had melted all in the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see if I can get a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can send it from my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had a spray bottle that actually
House of Harlequin gave me, Wade's
[SPEAKER_03]: organization, that was full of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was kind of in a spritzer,
so I was going to take it home and work
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tipped over in my refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed a day or so later, and it had
melted the plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plastic shelf on my refrigerator
infused the container to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the cold refrigerator, it was
corrosive enough to melt the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a picture of it here on my
phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see if I can get it to pull up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was a lesson learned the hard way
about not only how corrosive they can be,
but.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just posted this in the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can post it in the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hashtag group on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you click that little image I sent
you guys in this little chat, you could
[SPEAKER_08]: share that.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has a chart of the LDPE, HDPE,
PTFE, PSPP, PC, and ABS types of things
[SPEAKER_08]: that are out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it has all of the different
solvents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it gives you a rating of if it's
going to be good or not for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what caustic effects and things
like this, ether, ester.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got all kinds of nasty great stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you want to look for things like if
you look at the PTFE, it's all A's all the
[SPEAKER_08]: way down except for one category,
benzidine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you could see what would be
rated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're doing something with a hash
oil, and you're saying, OK, they're just
[SPEAKER_08]: using PP at the stopper, and you look at
terpenes, and you say, OK, terpenes with
[SPEAKER_08]: what we know about them, once you start
going past 8%, 10%, 20%, that stuff,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to have to use different
sources.
[SPEAKER_08]: And PTFE, like we talked about,
not something easily biodegradable,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it does work really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the new Blue River customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not biodegradable at all, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's not biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're looking at the best source for
not having any caustic effects.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again, part of the issue with some
of these things is a plastic is not just
[SPEAKER_07]: the polymer itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are talking about whether it's
polypropylene, polystyrene, there's
[SPEAKER_07]: polyolefin plastics, there's polyester
plastics.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what makes them flexible is they add
plasticizers to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a common plasticizer of the phthalates
that are used that they often have health
[SPEAKER_07]: concerns about, because they're in
plastics like for baby bottles and baby
[SPEAKER_07]: toys and whatnot, and they can leach out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess in certain dosages,
phthalate plasticizers can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the issue with a lot of these
materials, whether it's the lid on your
[SPEAKER_07]: vials or whatever that comes in contact
with extracts that are rich with terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: is that the terpenes will start to leach
out the plasticizer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you have plasticizer in your hash,
phthalates and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why you never want to use any
plastic containers to have anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to always use film vials for like
buds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, like for vials, for storing
stuff like this, it should be in a glass
[SPEAKER_07]: vial, not a plastic vial.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you shouldn't really be using plastic
syringes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see plastic syringes used quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the other thing, and again,
Tony, this might have something to do with
[SPEAKER_07]: what, like with these syringes right here,
they actually, they are stabilized to take
[SPEAKER_07]: some type of liquid load.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in most cases, like there are no,
you know, if you look at like the rubbers
[SPEAKER_07]: and all those rubbers, again, will all
start absorbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a matter of rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And certainly, like if you pull the plug
off of some of these syringes,
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll find that the rubber itself has
swollen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's like now the polymer
itself is now swollen because you've
[SPEAKER_07]: actually absorbed a lot of liquid into the
material itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't kind of fit it in anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, is that any material
that you come in contact with that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: synthetic material, like a polymer or a
plastic, a lot of those are coated or have
[SPEAKER_07]: plasticizers in there that could
essentially leach out with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's the more problematic
issue of using anything that comes in
[SPEAKER_07]: contact with an extractor concentrate that
could extract plasticizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ultimately, at the end of the day,
we have only so many choices, even the
[SPEAKER_08]: lids.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got new little lids for these
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they do sell PTFE underside,
yep, PTFE slip lids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they sell plastic ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they sell different shit that's under
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But ultimately, if you want to have the
safest vials for terpenes or the safest
[SPEAKER_08]: vials for high terpene oils, you kind of
have to go that direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we're kind of re-releasing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think that's how our
applicators are going to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that if you're using
something like that, I don't think if it's
[SPEAKER_08]: a short-term thing, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the whole concept has to be
redesigned.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll eventually have our own little
custom push-twist glass-on-glass refill
[SPEAKER_08]: applicator that can work like a syringe,
but not look like one, but also work like
[SPEAKER_08]: a controlled device.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see what happens when you have a
paper liner, and it's not a plastic liner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the paper starts to become basically a
reservoir for anything that's inside the
[SPEAKER_07]: jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's not a paper solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there are like coatings that
you can put on that are somewhat more
[SPEAKER_07]: biodegradable than PTFE.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is all of our new caps.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have that kind of liner like in
something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony, let's see that again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold that up again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's maybe like a polyethylene liner?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a P—yeah, I forget what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was slightly rated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought it was pretty good instead of
like a—I had to look it up when we bought
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was definitely better than the liner.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anything that's now, anything that's
saucy, it's like here's one that I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: using anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of those—this is what you
normally see, that little shit that's
[SPEAKER_08]: around there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't want a whole
container made out of that material.
[SPEAKER_07]: But certainly as a lid liner, that would
be just fine probably.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the silicone containers
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, those little weird rubber ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: They seem to—those seem to crack and break
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're a victim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you get like these little tiny
holes and the little pore holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like the material itself is
impervious to most.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's thermally cured at a higher
temperature, where again, polymerization's
[SPEAKER_07]: happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a barrier to keep things
from being absorbed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're only as good a barrier as they
are free of little pinholes or cracks or
[SPEAKER_07]: fissures.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where stuff can start getting
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel about LDPE and HDPE?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so those are just acronyms for low
density polyethylene.
[SPEAKER_07]: And high density polyethylene.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're made for petroleum.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to promote petroleum products
on this show?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're plastics.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in society.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's really—there's not much
you can do about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're everywhere, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess to do your limit to make sure that
any product packaging that you buy— Well,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying don't you think that's better
than PP?
[SPEAKER_07]: Polypropylene?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you think an LD or an HD would be
better as far as—I'll give you a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit more protection if you're talking
about more high terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it depends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, I think that those types of
high terpene products should only be
[SPEAKER_07]: packaged in glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, occasionally we get a fold that's
some kind of hash, and it's very,
[SPEAKER_07]: very terpy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it's within a fold, sometimes
difficult to deal with, and you wish you
[SPEAKER_07]: had it in a glass container.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would think that, yeah, less plastic
is good when it comes to anything that
[SPEAKER_07]: comes into contact with something,
especially something that you plan on
[SPEAKER_07]: dabbing or vaping.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I just wanted to jump in really quick
and show you guys a new package product
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're having here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got our CO2 extract that's in
between 10 and 26 percent terpene content,
[SPEAKER_11]: and so it's really, really high.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been worried about putting it in
any sort of plastic syringes, always going
[SPEAKER_11]: for the best that we can get, but plastic
was really the best at the moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after working and looking in China,
I found these.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's all glass on glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very similar to what you've got
there, Tony, that you've been using,
[SPEAKER_11]: although there's no silicone plunger.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they hold air.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you can pull it up and then it's
definitely an airtight fit there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anybody's looking for something to
put their extract in that's a high terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: extract, definitely look around.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alibaba is a good resource for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me ask you something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that plunger, since if you get to 20
or 30 percent with terpenes, does that
[SPEAKER_08]: plunger stay in on its own or do you have
to hold it in?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know it holds in.
[SPEAKER_11]: It holds in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So so I'm just, you know, yeah,
just sticking my finger over it there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can tell that it's it's airtight.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it just bounces right back up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, it's it's glass on glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that if you get over 20 or 30
percent terpenes, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_11]: losing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if you put pure terpenes in here,
they're going to come out the back side.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not it's not going to hold in that
really, really liquid terpene.
[SPEAKER_11]: But but yeah, for for anything that's a
mixture.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we haven't had any issues
with it on on the high terpene extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's important to talk about because
as everyone keeps boosting their terpene
[SPEAKER_08]: level, it's like that changes that
packaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I didn't release these.
[SPEAKER_08]: I made like six of these applicators and
kind of sat on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I changed the plungers, the LD,
you know, just done a few different
[SPEAKER_08]: things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, yeah, and it's like you could go
down that path.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then ultimately, I'm just doing a
little glass on glass spring loaded vial
[SPEAKER_08]: with a glass on glass micro dropper for at
least for the tanks, because I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: trying I'm not trying to get like I'm not
trying to use it for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to refill my frigging
tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like just like,
how do I get my sauce in something where I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't lose it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've got this beautiful like
live rosin sauce and cream.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're like, OK, what do I put it in?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't put it in a regular vial because
you won't get it all out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't put it in stuff that's going to
have any plastics because then that'll
[SPEAKER_08]: lead away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the same kind of the same thing you
probably went through.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, OK, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're like, I got to find something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, the glass syringes I
think are great.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just like some of the
dispensaries and some of the people are
[SPEAKER_08]: like, oh, it's a syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yeah, but like there's only so
many glass on glass things that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: use.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're either going to use a dropper in a
glass some form of vial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you're going to have to use a glass on
glass syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one Marcus has.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we found the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Alibaba's got really thin.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have really thin ones, too,
that are just exactly what you were
[SPEAKER_08]: showing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a big daddy one, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, yours was huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a two milliliter syringe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do sell the one milliliters that
are just like the standard one milliliter
[SPEAKER_11]: syringe.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Marcus has one up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the one mls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really like the form factor of the two
mil because you were able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: pull your gram of extract out and you
don't have a whole bunch of space in there
[SPEAKER_11]: taking up extra packaging space.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the two milliliter seemed to have
worked really well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I went in the other door for using this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually poured my sauce right in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let it drip right down and then just drop
the plunger in and build from there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't actually pull the sauce up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually really hard to pull up on
these syringes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a better way to go about it is to fill
a much larger syringe and then use a
[SPEAKER_11]: syringe to syringe connector.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can actually fill from the
bottom up and it'll just push the plunger
[SPEAKER_11]: up to one milliliter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then to do that, but then like for the,
you know, the common folk, like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the best is for what we went
with is the V insert inside the vial that
[SPEAKER_08]: has the sauce that can, you can just grab
it with a micro dropper to fill up your
[SPEAKER_08]: tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause then it's like more little parts.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was like going through this a
lot, but you know, if you're trying to use
[SPEAKER_08]: it for an applicator, yeah, the glass on
glass is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, long time, no see,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how he was gone for like eight
months and then he just pops right in and
[SPEAKER_08]: he's just like right into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like as if he was just like there the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a question real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I left the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could hear his voice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, Oh, sounds like Mr. Church is
in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks for continuing to extend the
invite.
[SPEAKER_11]: I, you know, I have family and so Sundays
is a sacred day for the family.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it just happens to be that I had a
little bit of time today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a church kind of day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Church on church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how the hell have you been?
[SPEAKER_08]: You get your, now you're doing a CO2,
like you're doing a high terpene CO2.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been doing some, some really high
terpene CO2, raw CO2.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no winterization.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's involved in the process using
really, really high quality material.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have all of the lipids that are
extracted.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's still lipids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me wrong, but it's, it's really,
you know, a high terpene content,
[SPEAKER_11]: just really liquid extract that we're able
to put right into a vape cart and,
[SPEAKER_11]: and go with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, really, really been blessed
with the, with the ability to work with
[SPEAKER_11]: Puffin farm up here in Washington state
and the legal market.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, just, just been enjoying
all the clean green certified material
[SPEAKER_11]: that they're able to provide.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your process is solventless then,
cause you're not winterizing.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, well it's, it's a solvent because CO2
is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people say, you know,
non solvent cause it's a totally different
[SPEAKER_11]: class, but yeah, it's, it's definitely
solvent extraction using a, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: Eden labs extractor is what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't, I mean, using CO2,
you don't test positive for residuals on
[SPEAKER_08]: anything, do you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm not putting any solvents in
there and CO2 off gases as soon as it gets
[SPEAKER_11]: to back to the, you know, regular
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no CO2 residual in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, at least not after 24 hours,
everything has, has off gassed out of
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, but yeah, no secondary solvents at
all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I always try to tell
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's that fine line when
someone's to go to CO2 extractors,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's solventless and like, well,
it would only be solventless.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I can, you know, we can argue the
definition of the solvent, but in the end,
[SPEAKER_08]: in the end here, ultimately what we're
putting in our lungs doesn't contain any
[SPEAKER_08]: footprint from a solvent.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not winterizing with alcohol,
where a lot of CO2 companies winterize
[SPEAKER_08]: with alcohol, grain alcohol, then they
have to put it in a rotor vat and they
[SPEAKER_08]: have to distill it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's always like that some small
percentage of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in my mind, what you're doing,
you know, is a very clean version of the
[SPEAKER_11]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's solvent free.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that because there's no
residual solvents left in the extract
[SPEAKER_11]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a gas that's turned into a liquid
and back into a gas.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the extraction is actually done in a
super critical pressure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the cannabinoid concentration in
your extract?
[SPEAKER_10]: It varies between the high forties and the
low sixties.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's suffice to say there is a fair
amount of lipids in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, there's also a large amount of
other constituents as well, like terpenes,
[SPEAKER_11]: like we've gotten up to 26%.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's taken a huge bite out of what,
you know, out of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be an 86% oil if you test 60
and 20.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's the flavonoids,
the other constituents that are
[SPEAKER_11]: extractable under CO2, supercritical.
[SPEAKER_11]: So then unfortunately we're not testing
for at the moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish that I could get an NMR done on all
of my extracts so that I could really know
[SPEAKER_11]: what was in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately it's just not,
not viable at the moment in our industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to send you a blank kit for
you to try the reusable Trinity tanks,
[SPEAKER_08]: because I think you would like them
specifically with the oil that you just
[SPEAKER_08]: described.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you put your address in the little
chat, not in the YouTube one, send me it
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll send you one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll text it over to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got your number as long as it hasn't
changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Text me over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'd just be curious to see what
your, what your high terpene CO2 raw would
[SPEAKER_08]: be like in one of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would put all kinds of different oil in
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, everybody's oil just to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet it would be spectacular.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried some, there was some holy water,
like the newer version, obviously like the
[SPEAKER_08]: solvent free holy water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I had, had some distillate,
some cold drop, distillate and turps
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I find that like it's, it's better suited
for a little bit thicker oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's better suited for what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's good for rosin hash rosin with
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good for like an oil that's a little
bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: It works fine with the thinner ones,
but I think you would find that this CO2
[SPEAKER_11]: is, it has like a thickness that happens
when it kind of coagulates and sits there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the moment that you move it in the
vial or in, you know, it just turns right
[SPEAKER_11]: to a liquid without even any heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can literally drip it out of the
syringes, which is, yeah, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: like what I noticed with, yeah,
exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like this is, this is a, once you hit
like 15%, I mean, if I took this off,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll show you same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just drips out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it literally just like,
like drips.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the same viscosity as what we're
dealing with up here for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: The tank, you're going to love the tank
then, because that's what it's designed
[SPEAKER_11]: for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad to, glad to try it out and
I'll let you know how it works out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting ready to put a whole bunch of
them in wash them in ISO.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try that dark thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said, Marcus, the, I'm going to try
one of the tanks in the dark clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, in the DC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to, I'm about to clean some of
the near future here as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: My two are just done.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will be cleaning some and hopefully
making a video.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am at the three hour point.
[SPEAKER_09]: I promised my family.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would go hang out with my little guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's his birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three, number three birthday.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to say thank you to
everyone for showing up from forest to
[SPEAKER_09]: Etienne, to skunk man, Sam, to Wade,
to Jeff Church, to the dragonfly medicine
[SPEAKER_09]: crew, to Mark Sial-Done, to Tony and D420K
who came and left and everyone watching.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for, you know, coming and
sharing your time with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just, yeah, three episodes left till
156, our three year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for watching everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out.
