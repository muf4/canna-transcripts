[SPEAKER_04]: Oh It smells so good in the air That one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really sweet air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sweet That's one of my girl's favorite
flavors whenever she I come home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it smells like Puff it on puff
Wednesday Yeah, I would have definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: not taken that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be sorry Boom, it's the rosin,
you know, but we'll actually take the
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger rips rosin I just like the taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really like blasting my head off
with the rosin But I have to say you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: nailed it today when you said the rosin is
really a byproduct of the bubble It's just
[SPEAKER_04]: the non melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly how we make well,
it's not a non melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely often Yeah, it's just nice
to be able to offer you know a product
[SPEAKER_01]: that's at least As good as it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and some people just like oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer oil sometimes It's easier to hold
but a lot of people prefer oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sometimes but I'm not sure if We've
ever really had the actual ability to test
[SPEAKER_04]: having a stash of beautiful melty dry
sifted water hash Because man if you have
[SPEAKER_04]: that in your stash, you got to think
you're hitting it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh here, let's hit some of this We still
didn't hit this either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still got the amnesia too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can smoke as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do three rips of rosin in a row.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're finished Because it's a puff
Wednesday, you know what we've been a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: lazy We're not really cruising around the
whole city finding beautiful spots to puff
[SPEAKER_04]: in but Hey, at least we're making a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been making videos lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I you know I almost lost my mojo a little
bit in regards to all of the traveling and
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the work that went into it and It's
uh, yeah, I'm feeling the fire again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like I like the idea of getting as many
videos Out as I can Wait, what are you
[SPEAKER_04]: hitting?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hit that later Get the knees in you
cuz I want to get the knees in me I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: get the knees in me until you get the
knees in you champion champion
[SPEAKER_01]: The niche It's like funky and then it
turns into like banana It reminds me of
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious It totally reminds me of
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love nostalgia Smells and tastes and
it's not even always candy like whenever I
[SPEAKER_01]: smell mothballs or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like boom Yeah, right crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just I'm in so much house right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to do a good puff Wednesday next
week where we go to a bunch of good spots
[SPEAKER_04]: if each of us if each of us were to like
Put three spots down, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we chose one or two of each spot
We just made a little you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: The mountain's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the idea going up to Cyprus I love
the idea going up to on the gondola on
[SPEAKER_04]: Squamish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the idea of getting down on the
water Taking a ferry over to frickin Bowen
[SPEAKER_04]: Island and just having a ferry session
doing whatever whatever There's all sorts
[SPEAKER_04]: of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it takes a little bit of
pre-planning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely does Yeah, I'm sure we can
always make something like that happen
[SPEAKER_04]: Good call at least once a week on both
points.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so Well, we're doing it this week
this week and it's happening right now 344
[SPEAKER_04]: p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: Live on a tough Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love peffing on a puffing on a
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice day and like you said people
are getting home from work right now and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like I just want to watch
something on YouTube for us like we were
[SPEAKER_01]: just like you get home after like a day of
maybe a job and you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it trippy watching YouTube videos and
then being in them?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's trippy because it gets easier as it
goes, but it's definitely weird,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yeah at first it was Kind of
trippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the evolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the evolution Let's wrap this church
sauce back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can just put those back wherever
they belong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember It's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna hit the purple candy 73 73
Yeah, I just like even the work That you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do to get a rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like clearly I just love hash Yeah,
it's just the process, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it everything was a process when I
when I was smoking joints all the time It
[SPEAKER_01]: was a process you had to go bust your weed
up, you know Get a paper pick whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: paper you like to use like I usually had a
couple of different papers going up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time just switching it up and It was
just a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to go outside and smoke eggs and
just ink your whole spot up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is definitely the evolution of
What's happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I remember when I stopped smoking joints
Started smoking hash and it really was
[SPEAKER_04]: like the end of that party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah 20 people sitting around and just
smoke everywhere and Then it was just like
[SPEAKER_04]: a bong went around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and everyone was just like
Especially when we first got turned on to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it was incredible Yeah,
first bong boots Dtfo before we even know
[SPEAKER_01]: what Dtfo was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah First bong hits can make or break
the bong hits forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true You have a too serious
bong hit for the first time you probably
[SPEAKER_04]: not hitting a bong again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very true It's a it's a it's a device
that can surprise you you shouldn't You
[SPEAKER_04]: know I smoke a whole joint, you know,
I'm just putting this much in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're underestimated Wow, don't
underestimate it Wow is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've seen it We all have that one
bong rep where people the person is just
[SPEAKER_04]: like clearly their brain has detached From
their spinal cord and now they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: like like the dudes that grab the nails To
pull them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, we're the guys that just hit the
ball and they're like on the ground So
[SPEAKER_04]: we're so afraid to break it down it's more
than I would take actually I like to pop
[SPEAKER_04]: many many bowls.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know many many many many many bowls
It's funny every time you guys give me
[SPEAKER_01]: hash how I'm like Yeah, but this well this
