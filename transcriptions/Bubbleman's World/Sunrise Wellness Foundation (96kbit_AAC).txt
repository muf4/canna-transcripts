[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Brett from West Coast
Concentrate and we're actually standing up
[SPEAKER_03]: in front of Sunrise Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bus going by so it's mega loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of traffic actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy street, good area for this place to
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vital air going by now, also very loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Dom and Max are the guys we met
the other day at Breeder Steve's
[SPEAKER_03]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They showed us the beautiful water hash
from Concentrated X and so we're coming
[SPEAKER_03]: down here today to pick some up,
to walk through their new location here
[SPEAKER_03]: and really just to check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys want to come with us,
let's go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy cornering out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looking to get some medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, do you guys have your Ds on you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to point out, I saw this as we
came in and this is an absolutely crucial
[SPEAKER_03]: piece in any cannabis enthusiast or
cannabis activist or cannabis aficionado.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in any of those categories,
Jack Carrere's number one best-selling
[SPEAKER_03]: book of all time, The Authoritarian
Historical Record of Cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Conspiracy Against Marijuana and How Hemp
Can Save the World.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a huge inspiration to me as a
young activist in Manitoba and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: really the book that we got hemp growing
legally for the first time in over 73
[SPEAKER_03]: years in our province.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to give shout-outs to that book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the first book I read about
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great book.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nice to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we head in?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you wearing the gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is Dom, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We met him just the other day and
obviously the flavors he shared with us
[SPEAKER_03]: were good enough that here we are a couple
of days later checking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit about your spot
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have you guys been here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome back to Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost about a year and a half,
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up just I think July 1st,
right around cannabis day of 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been around since there was about 40
dispensaries and now there's almost 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, the city of Vancouver is
trying to regulate it and bring it back
[SPEAKER_01]: down to like a number of closer to what it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of crazy stuff going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't heard much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slow to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: They certainly are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems like you guys kind of have a
special niche just from walking in right
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like you're kind of going for a
quality aspect of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find 80 different
strains here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try and curate a smaller menu that
ranges from 20 to 40 different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try and work with the same group of
vendors or like a very small group of
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors so we have a good idea of how they
grow things, their standards, their
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, kind of ensure that they're not
using plant growth regulators and other
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy different things that you definitely
don't want in your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we end up with a menu that has more
quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some stuff from the Temple of
Kaylakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some stuff from Humble Meds,
AC, Cypress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a pretty pretty large
solventless menu in town here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to get some West Coast
concentrates on in the next week here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep checking the Leafly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find we've got some awesome
strawberry banana from Concentrated X that
[SPEAKER_01]: you saw on Hash Church the other day and
you may have seen on Bubble Man's
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one is locked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is still sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sealed one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Bubble Man's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some awesome macro photos of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put some over top of the video when
I so callously grab the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also got some Golden Bear extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from Up and Whistler.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do some really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got some True Pink which I'll show
you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the True Pink 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I know that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done a video with them actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you can get pretty close there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes we can give it a
little... Quality looks on point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it local?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I definitely, it was the solventless
that got me, that put you on my radar,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually what we reach for when
we're reaching into our equator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do smoke VHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do smoke all that kind of stuff,
but I find that the solventless,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be Bubble Hash, Dry Sift,
or Rosin, it just works better for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me where I need to be with less
and without the added side effects that
[SPEAKER_01]: you get from solvent extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to walk us through a couple
of these beautiful rocks that you have out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the... So I just pulled out the boar.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different ones that we haven't
seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Romulan Mikado by the Temple of Calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a biodynamic example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do total living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool to Romulan cross Mikado,
which are two federation seeds crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice kind of grapefruit nose to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real head ringer of a sativa effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real upfront in the forehead.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mikado always reminded me of Breeder
Steve's Grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we have an Orange Tangy by Terra
Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a local producer here in Vancouver
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they placed in the Harvest Moon
Cup with their lemon-lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a new breeding project that
they've been working on, and it's kind of
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar to many of the Tangys you see
down in the States, and it's got this
[SPEAKER_01]: really awesome tangerine-orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very Cali-O to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always had a creamy back end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Tangy is Cali-O crossed with Skunk
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know, but I think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should know.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk Man Sam said it on hashtag the other
day, so that was where I was remembering
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that has a very nice,
you know, that very flavorful...
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're rosin it, it's like orange
custard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we have the High Rise Master Kush
by Heavenly Days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavenly Days definitely does some very
nice strains and concentrates in town
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This High Rise is just unbelievably
strong, very thick smoke, and tasty,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just super dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty dank.
Musky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last but not least... Next up,
we have a Blue God, and that's by Humble
[SPEAKER_01]: Meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice, just kind of a... You know,
I've seen this a lot in B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of reminds me of when I was a
teenager, and it's just got that really
[SPEAKER_01]: homey kind of smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of... It's hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, the color of the pistolet,
the stigma hairs, to me are very
[SPEAKER_03]: reminiscent of a stranger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pin that we used to have called the
Poo.
[SPEAKER_03]: P-O-O-H.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was... This is going back to the
90s now, but... God, it looked a lot like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sweet-smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has a nice smell to it,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like candy cane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely just smelly dog in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be nice in hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't rosin nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't rosined it yet, but... I
wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've noticed that the God rosin is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to see that there's a selection
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, do you guys do mail order as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do currently do mail order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just across Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just across Canada to valid MMPR federal
license orders.
[SPEAKER_03]: MMPR, but not MMAR?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an old MMAR, we will still
honor it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to be covered under the injunction,
but... For those of you that are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be asking me in this video if you are able
to order this up, I guess the next thing
[SPEAKER_03]: would be to say what website could they
find you guys at.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can reach us at www.mysunrise.ca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you have it, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to taste some of these fine
resins that we've been enjoying or dip
[SPEAKER_03]: into some of the fine flowers here at the
Sunrise Wellness Foundation, it's on
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: My spider sense isn't going off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel pretty good about this place,
I got to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for walking us through,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you have Horatio's transdermal balm
and his LHL in here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've got a really great range of
medical products as well, whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures, capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: No edibles, unfortunately, because the
City of Vancouver won't allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, they change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can usually get it done with
tinctures and capsules, Phoenix tears,
[SPEAKER_01]: ointments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't a way to get around the edibles
say for you to be just the same way you're
[SPEAKER_03]: selling?
[SPEAKER_03]: These would be for you to sell tubs of
coconut oil extract that people could
[SPEAKER_03]: either cook with or just eat and consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's a pre-packaged cooking
oil, we can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we've got some honeys
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are classified as honey tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a little bit of sway with what
they define.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want confectionary and
baked goods, anything that looks appealing
[SPEAKER_01]: to children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, much appreciated, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really got to say thanks for walking us
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys out there in Balman's world,
if you want to check this place out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys can check it out on their web or
you can come here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The address?
[SPEAKER_01]: 258 West Broadway or 2943 Kingsway up by
Kingsway and River.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so what's the cross street here on
Broadway?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really close to Broadway and Canby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close to Broadway and Canby.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this information is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the only thing left to do is
for me to get some hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a earth burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highest of the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at me, you see my eyes so
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we go find up on Salaman Head.
You know.
