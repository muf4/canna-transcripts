[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just out here playing around with my
plants, doing a little bit of gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning them up and whatnot, and I
noticed I had some barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some 99% barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sitting, ignore the numbers,
it's definitely not 160 or 190,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I had some 99% barb and it was
sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just sitting over here while I was
working away on the plants and I heard the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind blow it and I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it go, oh no, oh no!
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's why we make our sift clean
right there, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is bone dry powder that is stuck to
this card harder than you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people say to me, oh, be careful Bubble
Man while you're making your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that to blow away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, achoo, achoo!
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you stabilize and clean hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
