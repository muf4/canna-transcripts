[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some problems that keep me up
like coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fearless experience, where I'm headed is
more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Permanent screwwaddles, my life often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I'm not dipping, you're just causing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start to mention the past too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stuck at the crossroads, but I'm not a
lost soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Building my castle, call me a tadpole,
cause I'm learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super fine, I'll keep it straight
and narrow.

over again.

safe by the way.

strong.

Gideon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a trillion, a barrio in my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Gideon, but I've got no
paramount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most tired guy's with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I know it's entirely out of the
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to welcome my brownie cronics on
the stage, you know.
